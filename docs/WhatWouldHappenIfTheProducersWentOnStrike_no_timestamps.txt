 What's up everybody it's Russell Brunson welcome back the marketing secrets podcast. I've missed you guys
 I've been MIA for the last two weeks on
 Vacation enjoying my time my family you guys had to rerun episodes. We had one which was
 Why entrepreneurs suck at vacations, which is something I think a lot of us relate to although this time was different for me
 I don't know about you, but you know because of coronavirus and because I really really needed a break
 It was really nice for me and anyway, so I enjoyed it and then number two was
 Entrepreneur scars and that's one that we play a couple times now because every time I I play a new segment of
 My listeners here and they're like oh my gosh, and it's it's it's one of my favorite episodes. Hopefully it helped
 And yeah, so with that said though this episode
 I want to talk about something that I've been thinking a lot about ever since my vacation
 So my vacation I decided to read a book by read I put that quotation marks
 I decided to listen to a book because I've tried to read this book more and five five or six times
 And it's so big so thick. I couldn't do is finally I've got an audiobook and I got two-thirds of it done
 It's a book called Alice shrugged and it's got me thinking and I want to share some of my thoughts with you
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money for our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answer. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so to to preface this to preface this whatever it's called to start us off
 I want all of you guys. I want to recommend that each of you guys listening to this go and read the book at the shrug to get the audio book
 Now I want to warn you it is fat. It's like I don't 1200 page book. I've tried to read it over the last decade five or six times
 I've never succeeded a move the movies came out. I watched the first movie that I never watched second 30 yet
 But anyway, it's a fine as I have to I got heard so much stuff. I need to read this book. So I finally started
 Reading it listen to audiobook on my trip and I got two-thirds of it done
 And now I'm like engrossed in it and it's really good written back in I think like the early 1920s by a lady named
 I in Rand. I don't know if I pronounce her name right or not
 but she's someone who
 Have this this thought in this premise like what would happen to society to this world if the producers went on strike
 Okay, and in fact the book initially the working title before she published it was called the strike and by producers
 She means anyone who's who who's producing stuff right the producers versus like the looters and the the
 They call them the looters so it's people that are like trying to steal from the producers or trying to tax the producers to take away
 What they're doing right so producers
 In this sense aren't necessarily entrepreneurs, but anyone who's creating who's producing okay?
 You might be the entrepreneur starting a business
 Which I know a lot of you who are listening are you may be someone inside of a business who are producing results
 You're you're creating you're doing things like that and so
 The message was what happens when the producers are people who are passionate who care about their their work who who care about creating things
 What happens when when they go on strike?
 And it's so fascinating. It's not they want to go on strike. They love their work
 They love their like all of them have a mission like they're doing the thing out of the love of their heart because they're doing it
 But then there's the looters right and the looters in this book are government and social things and all these things that are happening
 Where they're like, you know, it's not fair that somebody should have more than one business
 It's not fair that blah blah blah you know all these things for the same these laws and these rules to keep taking things away from
 From the producers and it throughout the book. There's different laws that keep getting passed by the by the government, you know
 The first one was called the anti-doggy dog
 Rule, which basically made it
 I remember when that one was anyway, that was that was a very very first one and because that
 Because that was regulations a whole bunch of companies and producers it made it so that they no longer had
 Got rewarded for producing and so they they just started these people these producers are disappearing
 And I don't know whether they go yet because I finished the book but they disappeared and then a little while later
 They the government comes they change another role where no nobody should have more than one company and then because of that
 It makes it the next segment of producers no longer have reward for producing and so they start disappearing and I was like
 Where do these people go like I don't know where they're gone?
 And this thing keeps happening about the book whether the government keeps passing different regulations and things like that try to make things more fair and try to
 Like all these things and as it's happening every single time it takes away the ability for reward from a producer
 And eventually producers go and strike they disappear
 Now I haven't finished the books. I can't tell you where they went or the moral of the story or any of the things
 But it was interesting to me because if you're listening to this podcast my my guess is you are a producer in some fashion either
 You are an entrepreneur who started a business your inside of business your building funnels your driving your creating your like your like your producer, right?
 And so this this book should speak to you and this message should speak to you, right?
 because it's it's interesting like
 When you look at this book, it's like what like what happens to the society when the producers go on strike and so you start looking at like
 Like the aftermath and the destruction and all the bad that's coming out of the book right now
 It's like after all the producers are gone that I'll pull out of this thing
 You see what happens society how it crumbles and falls apart?
 Because the looters aren't people are they're not producing right they're not they're not creating they're not developing they're not making things
 They're just they're they're leaching on and like taxing and and trying to make a lot so they can they can take your money for me
 And it's really really fascinating and I learned a couple things I want to share with you so far
 And the book likes that I'm through like 800 pages. So there's a lot of stuff I could share but in the context of this podcast
 Number one is I want all of you guys who are listening to this who are producers to understand
 Your value and your importance in this economy in this society
 If it wasn't for you and your contribution you try to create and serve and build and give and do these things
 The very fabric of our society would collapse if you read this book you'll see like that obviously it's a fictional story
 But it's showing what would happen if the producers disappeared
 So I want you to understand the world and how important how vital it is to to this economy to this world
 Because I think a lot of times we forget that right?
 That's number one number two. I want you to be very very aware
 of the looters of
 people of agencies the governments that
 Are trying to create taxes and trying to create things and
 Registration and laws to take away your freedoms and take away your ability
 That's what your ability to take away your reward for producing
 Okay, as you know when anybody starts any kind of business
 There's inherent risk the second you you apply for your business license
 There's risk you're putting out your money your time your effort and second you have a business like people can sue you
 People can like everything opens up like just by the mere act if you saying I'm gonna start a business
 Or I'm gonna go and produce it opens up risk for you, right?
 The second you do and the bigger you get the more risk are skin piled upon you
 I can tell you now someone who has built and crashed companies twice and have built company to to a pretty substantial level
 The bigger you get the higher the risk is and the risk is stressful and gets more and more heavy and heavy and heavy
 I look at my life and like the thing that's the hardest for me
 I was the the man some of the risk that that we take on is insane
 Having a hundred thousand customers all publishing whatever they want on our platform like insane amounts risk
 and full-time legal team now just taking legal calls from people trying to sue me because so and so
 Some moron on our platform is I agree. I got sued by Taylor Swift Taylor Swift sued me. How cool is that?
 Not actually cool, but because some someone
 Decided to go and to loot from her and to
 basically produce
 and basically go and
 Take her stuff and post it on a click-finance page and try to start selling it and so you know
 They weren't suing me. I was able to go and and turn it
 You know we had to turn off but but like we get those things every single day from from stuff, right?
 GDPR when the UK decided to change their their loss
 We spent over two or three million dollars and like almost a year of film into
 Rebuild the entire cliff once platform to be GBR compliant the next thing the next is just like ah anyway
 It's chaos
 And so the bigger you get the more the more the more risk you have and so I want you to be aware of that though
 but also
 You know, I've never been someone who's big in politics or government and I'm not gonna get on a soapbox now, but I do
 Now understand way more why it's important for us to care and to vote and to be aware of these things
 I want to encourage you guys as producers playing sometimes like I'm just gonna work and work through and I'm just gonna forget
 Everything else and let it all fall to the wayside. That's what always my kind of my philosophy
 But after reading this I see why it's important first to be more involved in those kind of things. So that's number two
 And number three is just kind of come back to number
 It's similar to one but just understanding how vital how important it is for you to produce you can't stop you got to create
 As soon as you know if the laws and the taxation always seems to get worse and worse and worse for us to a point where you have no risk
 Or a student should be no reward. You know when there's a point where where you lose your reward, right?
 then we stop risking producers will stop risking when they lose the reward and
 There are people who do not want you to have the reward of your your effort of your brains if you're a hard work
 You're determination all the things you're doing and so it's like being it's just important to understand that
 Because I think that if we're not careful
 Sometimes things hopeless like why should I even try I'm not gonna lie sometimes reading this book
 I'm just like I'm out peace
 I don't even want to try any more because it can all be taken away by the looters by the governments by the things like that and I think it's just
 It's important to understand how important it is to produce and keep producing and keep working towards it. It's funny
 I like yes, I'm a member of the church of Jesus Christ the Latter-day Saints
 And we read a book called the Book of Mormon as well as the Bible and in the Book of Mormon
 There's this section where there's this evil king Noah
 He was back in ancient America and they're talking how he taxed his people to the point where the burden the burden was so heavy and
 It was crazy because he said they taxed he taxed him one fifth of all they possessed
 And I was like I told my kids like like man evil king or it attacks them one fifth and I was like whoa
 That's a lot of money. I was like so if you had a dollar and taking 20 cents like whoa, you know
 And I was like guess how much uncle Sam's taxing
 Me right now, they're like whoa like 10% 15% I'm like it's more than 50
 What like it's just crazy the world written out like
 Anyway, it's just crazy. So I am pro-capitalist and I'm pro-democracy. I'm pro
 You know all these things and so
 Anyway, I just want to show it with you guys because it's in top of my mind recently just thinking about it thinking about like
 How vital it is for us to keep producing and get my message to you and to all producers all entrepreneurs all
 You know to the people listen to me to the sound of my voice is like we have to keep producing because I've seen a glimpse or even
 This book I've seen a glimpse of what happens to society and the economy if we stop
 Number one number two is it to be aware of the people the things that are trying to stop us from producing the looters
 We're trying to take away our freedoms trying to take away our money trying to take away the reward we get for our risk
 Because if they do take away a reward then there's no reason for any of us to risk and then that's the second thing that'll happen
 Those two ways for this whole this whole game that we're playing to to crumble number one is I stop producing number two is the looters coming in and
 And creating the things that keep us from having any reward from our risk
 And so just be aware of that
 It's important to fight for it's important for us to keep it because
 If not then what's the point of any of this stuff, right?
 So yeah, that's all I got that said I appreciate you guys listening
 I'm gonna keep reading the book and when I get down on maybe I'll do a wrap-up episode
 But I recommend reading you just to think through it. I'm sure some of you guys are gonna agree with us and you guys are disagreeing
 And that's okay. It's good for conversation
 I just think that it's important for you specifically because you're listening to the sound of my voice right now
 And you are someone who is a producer who's trying to create you trying to give you trying to serve and
 she's just help you understand why what you're doing so valuable and so important and how to protect it and
 If you get nothing else from this this podcast upsets that I hope that helps you are important
