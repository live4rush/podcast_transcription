 Hey everyone, this Russell Bronson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast. I'm so excited to have you guys here and during today's episode
 I'm gonna be talking about why in the world did I after 15 years of
 retirement decided to go back and
 Russell in my very first wrestling tournament in a decade and a half
 Why didn't and what it has to do with you?
 So that said let's cue up the theme song and I'll be back to tell you guys behind the scenes
 What happened to my very first wrestling tournament in the last 15 years?
 So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own
 pockets
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet
 Still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Bronson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, everybody. Hope you guys are all doing amazing today
 so I just got back from Las Vegas and I
 those who follow me on Instagram or Facebook you've kind of seen some of the behind the scenes of what's happening and
 You know, I had so many questions and so many cool things
 And I was like I should just sit down and record a podcast to kind of to share with everybody
 What happened and why I did it and why you should actually care and maybe you don't care
 That's really cool as well. So skip to the next episode, but
 basically, it's interesting so those who of you have been following me for a long time know that my
 first love in life was wrestling I started wrestling when I was in eighth grade and
 And then by ninth grade I fell in love with it. It became my like my everything. That's all I cared about and
 You know every thought every moment every you know every calorie I burned up point four was all about one goal and one goal
 Or only that was to be you know to be a national champ and in high school
 I was my junior year. I won the state title. So the Utah State champ my senior year actually good winning went into the
 the state tournament actually lost
 Actually lost in the semis or something and I took third in state which
 Was was really really hard for me
 And I remember being so so upset
 I knew there was a
 National tournament coming out like I can't remember two or three months later
 And I thought you know I had to prove that wasn't just a just a guy who got lucky
 I need to prove that I'm a legit wrestler and so for next like two or three months between
 Between the state tournament and the national tournament. I was literally working out seven plus hours a day
 I was working in the morning
 I was wrestling at my high school after school and I would drive to other high schools and find other kids and just whatever I could to wrestle and
 I was being a good wrestler during that period to becoming a great wrestler and went to the NCAA tournament
 or not the NCAA term the the equivalent of that the college national tournament and
 It's crazy because you had to be a state champ to be able to go but because I'd want to say I'd won state my junior
 I qualified to go so went my way class. There was like
 68 or something state champs and
 and
 They had to be you to be a senior and you be a state champ to go this tournament
 so
 It was basically the best of the best and I went that tournament and I ended up taking second in the nation which was
 Amazing I became an all-American
 That opened the door for me to be able to wrestle in division one school so the rest will be why you for a year
 They end up cutting the wrestling program. I transferred to Boise State
 Russell there my next four years sorry for the quick history lesson
 But just see us in context of why this is so exciting for me and then my senior year
 I had a plan you know
 I've my whole goal through college was being all American like I'd done in high school
 I want to be an all-American in college as well and I kept being closer and closer to it and my senior year
 At the pack 10 tournament which I was planning it's fun. My very first match
 I had I drew the returning pack 10 champ and I beat him. I just like oh this is gonna be easy
 I'll be you know super easy and stays are in two weeks
 I'll wrestle that and then and then that's the end of my career and I was kind of like looking for the thing happening in two weeks from now
 And what's crazy is that I won that first match and for some reason I just
 I just didn't perform and I ended up losing my next two matches and I didn't qualify for the national tournament
 And I remember how weird that was to thinking that my wrestling career was gonna end in two weeks
 And then instead it just ended right then I remember sitting on the side of the mat like bawling my eyes out and just like this is
 The worst feeling ever and I don't know what to do. I was scared. I was you know
 Everything my entire life had been up to that point reaching towards this goal and suddenly it was gone
 And I had no opportunity to try to go after it
 I didn't know what to do or and
 And so for me I shifted and I was like if I don't if I don't shift my focus
 I'm gonna go into depression like I gotta find something else focus on and at the time
 I had this little fledgling internet business was making almost no money
 I was like I'm gonna focus on this thing and I and I
 Turned everything to that and my beautiful wife so I had two two focuses and that consumed me for next
 Man for next eight plus years my life after that point
 I decided I wanted to wrestle again and I'm not gonna go deep in this story
 But if you listen old podcast episodes, you know, I decided I wanted to train for Olympics
 I hired Olympic Greco coach and moved into Boise
 I hired like half the Olympic Greco wrestling team brought them to Boise to work for me and support them
 So that we'd all wrestle together. I did that for three or four months and then the company my company almost from bankrupt
 I had to leave and had to shut it all down and it was you know another
 Sad spot in my life and then fast-forward now till today and it's been 15 years since that match that I lost and
 And I was like the whole life. I thought I would wrestle again
 I thought I would go to some tournaments. I just never have never have and 15 years later
 I was finally like I need to do this if I don't do it now. I'm never gonna do it and I knew that there's a
 There's a national tournament and it's for people
 They have different age groups right so they'd like the really good guys are the national tournament didn't compete with them
 So in case you're wondering I'm not that good anymore, but there's different divisions
 So there's a 25 to 35 year old division 35 to 45 45 to 55
 I think 55 plus and so I was in the 35 to 45 year olds and
 And then there's two styles freestyle Greco
 So we went and we signed up we trained for a day and then I tore my neck had some nerve
 Damage in my neck where I couldn't even anyway, I couldn't even move for like a week
 So I did one practice and then took a week off
 We did two more practices and I reheared my neck and took the rest of the week off and then we went to the tournament
 so literally with three practices and
 We showed up to this tournament me and a couple my buddies and friends
 And we went out there and it was so much fun. My very first match
 It was like dusting off 15 years of cobwebs like I was so nervous and I had put a singlet on forever
 And I went where I going out there and I got beat pretty good the very first match
 I was like oh crap this is gonna be an embarrassing weekend
 I've been talking about this on Instagram and social media and podcast and it's gonna be so embarrassing
 But then I won my next four matches and I'm taking third place in the tournament got a big old trophy thing
 Which was really cool and next it was Greco and
 The brackets are smaller and Greco, but I'm taking second in Greco and got another big trophy and stuff
 And it was just so much fun so much fun to go out there and do the thing again that I've that I've missed
 for so long and
 You know we just got home into my whole body story everything hurts my hands hurt my head hurts
 My feet hurt like every every spot on my body is sore and tender, but it was so so much fun
 It's so worth it. So it's interesting because a lot of people women as I was posting it on on Instagram
 I remember I was like to try post this like most my Instagram stuff is me talking about business stuff
 I'm like should I be posting this like why you know like do people care like and I was just like what's the point of it?
 And I remember thinking as I made a posted a picture I was like I'm doing this
 It with a goal to try to give everybody else who's listening is permission to do that thing that they've wanted to do for the last 15 years
 But haven't because they've been scared or whatever that is and man that resonates people so some people message me back like oh
 My gosh because this I'm gonna go run a marathon
 I'm gonna go do this thing I'm gonna go take piano lessons again like all the stuff that like that we've we've wanted to do and so
 I
 And so because that I was like I'm gonna share more of this journey
 So we shared on Instagram pictures and videos and all sorts of fun stuff just kind of documenting the process and sharing with everybody
 And and so that's kind of the point of this podcast
 I wanted to show because I had so much fun and I've been so scared and nervous and like put it off for for
 15 plus years I've put this thing off because you know
 I didn't know and what if I lost and then you know all the different things and finally came back like I don't care
 If I was I just want to do the thing the thing that like was my childhood dream that you know
 I said goal hit some of my goals and hit I didn't all of them
 But just I missed that part of my child and that part of my of my life and so I did it
 It was so much fun
 And I'm hoping that for all you is listening that the first thing you don't you stop said I wasn't a wrestler like Russell
 But what's my thing like what was the thing that when I was growing up when I was a kid I
 Love I was obsessed with I would do anything to do that thing and I haven't because I'm old cuz I'm a cheer now
 I'm you know I'm an adult. I don't do those kind of things anymore
 but like I want to encourage you to like take a little break step back for a minute and like think about what that thing is for you and
 Then do it like if it means go entering a marathon or it means go and like signing up for singing competition or for means
 You know whatever it is for you like like I want to I want to hopefully give you permission to try that thing and
 A couple things when you do that number one you are not gonna be as good as you remember
 Okay, and that was one of my biggest fears and frustrations into this thing is like I'm wrestling these guys
 And I like I see the shot open and I'm looking at it and my body doesn't move and I miss the shot
 Right or I see it and then I move it
 It's too late I get destroyed because like you're not as good as you used to be and it's like that's a hard mental thing
 but it's like it's okay like
 because like
 It's it's not about that like I remember going in and I was like at first I was super nervous like if I lose
 It's gonna be embarrassing but eventually was like I don't care if I lose like I just wanted
 I just wanted to do this again like it was such a part of my life for you know 15 20 years of my life and and
 Like I haven't been around I haven't done it for so long. I just wanted to do it
 So that's the first thing is though. You're not gonna be the good you used to and that's okay
 Number two is like as you get closer to the date everything
 Everything that could like sway you from doing it will come up in your life like like for me
 Like I tore my neck out twice like I shouldn't have gone right closely
 We had other things happening and there's business stuff from family stuff like there's a million things that that will keep you from doing it
 but the thing is just do it anyway like just take the time and do it and
 I'm the last thing just enjoy it and and realize that you know that part of your that chapter of life is gone
 But it's like doesn't mean you can't still experience it every once in a while
 I think that it's been a big fear of mine of like I why I didn't go back is like you know
 The peak I was at this level in my head
 I should have been here and it's like I can't ever achieve that again, but it's like that's okay
 It's like just do it because it's it's fun to experience it again
 And it brings like the excitement and the the passion for that thing back into your life
 And so for me, that's what it was and it was so much fun and I really enjoyed it
 I hope that this gives some of you guys permission to do that thing that you've been
 You've been
 procrastinating or thinking about or or bearing in your your subconscious mind for the last 10 years or 20 years or how long
 It's been for you. Hopefully gives you permission to go and just do it have fun doing it and and enjoy it because I
 Think that so many of us get so caught up in
 The rest of our life, right?
 and for me it's kids and business and
 Poise and teams and like there's so many things we had caught up in that we forget about
 You know the stuff that lives on fire when we were younger, so get some of that fire back
 It'll bleed into everything else you're doing. We're excited about life again
 But you just got to go and do it so hopefully it gives you permission have fun with it
 And I'm gonna make this a yearly thing now and every year I'm gonna go to this tournament and I'm gonna compete in it and
 And get a second and third now I got to get better for next year, so hopefully I'll get
 First and first and if I don't that'll be alright because I have the rest of my life keeping it better at it
 It was crazy
 We got there and the first day we're warming up and kind of just trying to lose weight and get you know
 Get back into it and this old guy waddles over
 He's got messed up knees and ankles and he starts talking to us. He's from London
 He's like I'm 67 years old and he's like I he's like in London
 There's no one to wrestle with so I fly to America every year for this tournament
 And they wanted to wrestle with all of us and my neck was really bugged me so I didn't wrestle with him, but he wrestled with
 with Lex case and George Ivan off who the two guys that came with me and
 It's so funny to start wrestling. He's like just you know my my knees are bad. My ankles are bad
 So don't shoot all me
 He's out there like this guy can barely even walk and he's out there wrestling at 67 years old and
 I remember looking at that took a picture with me and him and I said it to my to my wife
 I said this is my new hero. This is my goal in life
 I want to be 67 years old with blown out knees and ankles and still showing up because I want to be a wrestler
 Because I am a wrestler and that's
 That's the thing so I'm picking my thing. It's wrestling. I'm not gonna go run a marathon with all you marathorners
 You can do that. I'm not gonna go swim. I'm not gonna sing. I'm not gonna
 but I'm gonna wrestle every year until I can't and
 Knowing from this dude that we met this weekend like even your knees are blown out
 You can still show up and wrestle so looks like I'll be doing this till the day I die
 so anyway, I hope this helps you guys. I appreciate you. Thanks for listening and
