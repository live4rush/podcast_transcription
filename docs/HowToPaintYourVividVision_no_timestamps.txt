 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast right now
 I'm driving downtown Boise to the pet house and
 Just had an interesting thought I wanted to share it yet
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right everybody so I just jumped my car is eight o'clock a night
 summertime so most nights I'm up playing my kids so for forever and I'm just tired and worn out beat up and
 At the same time I have a lot of stuff to do I think I told you guys between the traffic seekers book manuscript
 The unlock the secrets event on teachings for three days straight and a bunch of other things that keep coming up
 compiling on and it keeps getting heavier and heavier and I was just like tonight told Kaleira's like I need I need to get stuff done
 And so what I wanted to do is drive the pet house. I'm like I'm gonna sleep down there tonight work for five or six
 seven hours tonight pass that wake up work all day tomorrow with nobody around no distractions no nothing and
 That's how I'm doing. I'm jumping the cars 801 p.m. I'm driving there. I should be able to get four or five hours of working tonight and
 then
 Tomorrow get a good 12 hours in and just dominate the day and hopefully you know get two or three chapters on the book get
 Fire six of the presentations for the unlock seekers event outlined and a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff that I have to do
 Because I have to do it. So that's the game plan of the goal. I am really tired
 I'm not gonna lie going into this. Hopefully I'm gonna have energy to keep it going
 But it'll be good, but I'm working well. Yeah, we're gonna love fun stuff
 so but the reason why I want to do podcast right now is because
 this is a really interesting
 psychological cell strategy that
 that was used on me to get me to invest in this penthouse and
 Just some context I haven't talked a lot about I think I've mentioned like I'm going to the penthouse
 I never talked about what exactly it is and I'm not gonna do a ton of detail
 but basically downtown Boise we purchased a penthouse and it's kind of insane, but it's beautiful and I
 Went to look at initially just because I thought it'd be fun to go look at a penthouse right like and
 We got there and it's like on the top floor
 This building and you see all the Boise is beautiful and it's super cool and I'm looking at like this is so cool
 I love this thing, but never once crossed my mind that ever actually buy it like there was it wasn't even like I
 totally went just because I thought it'd be fun to go see it right and
 And we wanted to walk in walk down to all the rooms
 I was like this is so cool
 I can't even imagine like living here and how cool I would be and all those you know all the thoughts that kind of go with that and
 Then we walked in this one room and it was the office and it's it's not a huge office
 It's a little office and it overlooks the entire city of Boise
 It's beautiful and they had a desk there in a chair and stuff like that
 as I walked that room I was there with Dave Woodward my beautiful wife Collette and
 And Brent Co. Peters and the real estate agent. I think I was different than was there
 Anyway, I'm walking in there and I'm sitting there in that room and I sit behind the desk
 I'm looking out over the whole city of Boise and Dave said a phrase. He said can you imagine sitting in that desk riding the traffic seekers book?
 and like for a second I imagined it and I was like oh my gosh like
 How cool would that be sitting here and writing the book and looking over the city and like daydreaming me like figuring out concepts and like riding
 them like all those all those things right and
 That was the seed that that visualization of that experience is what made me
 desire this penthouse increase the desire so much so that we ended up buying something that logically makes no logical sense whatsoever
 but because of the vividness of
 That vision I heard something called before vivid vision like because of the vividness of that vision
 It caused me to do something
 Defying all logic and completely go with an emotional cell and buy it and
 And so I was on one shirt yesterday is the power of like of painting a vivid vision for your people to
 dream about why why should some invest in your product or your service and
 You know we have all these things we do all these techniques all these strategies and you know
 We and we talk I talk a lot about these on the podcast and the books right
 And and all of them have important things right like like telling stories to break people's false belief patterns and trump their story
 That's such a powerful tool for sales
 You know using urgency and scarcity is so powerful, but when you look at all those things tied in together
 I think one of the most powerful things that I rarely talked about probably because they couldn't articulate until
 It just really this experience to myself was
 How do you paint a vision in your?
 Potential customers mind like not just a vision like a vivid vision that they can feel they can taste they can smell they can see they can
 Experience in their mind so much so like they put themselves in that spot like I experienced it like I need this
 I want that that feeling again and
 and
 It's just something interesting to think about so
 Yeah, because it just got me to spend a ton of money and I'm thinking about that with with click fun
 My business I think you know unknowingly I've done that a lot of times I try to paint a vivid vision for for the fun
 Act community and for our people and for you know everything I'm like what's possible?
 It could look like like what what the future could be if you were to have a funnel, you know all those kind of things
 But again for me every time you you see when you become aware of something you become aware of the pattern of the concept of the idea
 That it's easier to to amplify it and so tonight
 This is what I just want to share with you guys is like what's the vivid vision you're trying to cast for your audience?
 Like what does that look like they were to experience whatever it is you experience right like the business or the relationship or the
 Whatever it is you're selling right?
 Like imagine at the peak like the best possible experience they can have in that moment
 Like what would that look like and how can you paint that in the minds of your prospect?
 You know for me it was Dave sitting there saying man can you imagine like sitting here and writing the traffic secrets book like looking out
 That's that's the the background. They write this thing on and
 Like I did I saw it. I felt that I tasted I smelled it like I experienced it and it was so real and so exciting and so
 I don't know the words
 So much so like I wanted I fought on my side to make that that possible
 I think I went out of my way to convince myself and everyone I love and everyone around me like I must get this thing as
 Opposed to the real estate agent trying to close me the real estate didn't do anything didn't do anything just
 You know someone was there who painted the vivid vision and so that's my question for you guys is like
 How do you how do you paint that vivid vision in the minds of your customers and?
 You know part of its story, but it's even more so than that's like experiential like
 You know if you if you've listened back to any of the episodes about storytelling or the expert secrets book
 You're talking about one of the biggest things with with stories like you have to get into the modalities like it's not just like I
 Went to the store and I felt good. That's almost what tells story right?
 It's like I went to the store and I was walking in I felt this weird tingling down my spine and as I as I
 As I walked through I felt like burst of cold air on my skin
 and and you know and
 And it broke me out this cold sweat because of the nerves that had I was going through and my hand starts sweating and I walked
 Through I could feel my heart slowly starting to be faster and faster like you know
 You tell story like that we start bringing in the the the visualization of what you're actually experiencing right?
 Like the the mind the the body the the gut the like the feelings you feel and you explain those things people
 It becomes more real form right like for Dave in that in that moment because I was sitting there and I could actually experience it
 It was you know, it's more powerful
 I don't need Dave to go to the whole details like can you imagine the smell of the wood like cuz I'm sitting there
 I'm smelling the wood of the desk right
 And so so much more powerful in that when it's in person and and you know
 You're able to see it and to fill it
 But when you're not in person and you're on a webinar or a podcast or whatever like how do you how do you paint that vivid?
 Vision in such a way that
 That people experience it right and it's coming in and like telling the story and explaining the senses and what they
 Smelt what they felt what they experienced and what they you know all those all those things you're plugging those in to the
 Descriptions you're explaining it and that's against people to fill it and experience it before they've ever had it
 And when they experience that vivid vision, that's the secret
 That's when they start coming to you and they will start convincing themselves ever around them that they need to buy your product
 They will come and they will sell you on why they need your product because because they want it so bad so help the helps
 You put that up on your on your your boards
 paint the vivid vision like what's the vision you're gonna pay for your customers and
