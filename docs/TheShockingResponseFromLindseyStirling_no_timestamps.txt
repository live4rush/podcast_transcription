 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast. I hope you loved the last episode where I had
 Let you guys in behind the scenes to hear Lindsay Sterling at Funnel Hacking Live share some amazing wisdom and ideas and thoughts
 And I'm even more excited if that's possible for today's episode because after we cute the theme song and come back
 I'm gonna let you guys listen in behind the scenes of the live Q&A
 I did with her afterwards on stage and we go over a lot of cool things in there
 I think you're gonna love it. But the one thing that impressed me the most I want to kind of
 Put it from my perspective so when you hear it'll it'll hopefully have the same impact on you that had on me
 But I do know that before we brought her on stage
 I knew that she was on America's Got Talent and I do know that
 She made it through a couple rounds and they kicked her off and said she wasn't good enough
 And so I specifically I wanted to ask for that question and and find out, you know
 What did you feel what was going on in your mind and what I assumed she was gonna say?
 I was like, oh, yeah, they screwed me like oh ball whatever like, you know, or
 You know, they kicked me off. They knew I was I was gonna prove them all wrong and like that's what I assumed she was gonna say
 When she responded back to that answer
 But instead what she said was so different and so much better and so much more powerful what she said afterwards was
 She got off the show and she went home and and she looked at herself and she realized that they were right
 She wasn't good enough yet and so because of that she went back and she started practicing and working hard until she became
 Good enough till she became the Lindsey Streli met we had a chance to experience a fun-locking live and
 Such a such a powerful thing like I thought the message of like, you know screw you
 I'm gonna work harder anyway would have been powerful
 But the message she left instead was a thousand times more powerful and a lot of times the market tells us no one
 We have to look at ourselves and say you know what?
 The markets right sometimes and instead of me fighting it. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna I'm gonna go and become good enough and
 Such a powerful thing. Anyway, there's this interviews amazing. It's not super long. I'm never interviewed someone on stage before
 I'm not gonna lie. I was a little bit nervous. It's only about 10 minutes long
 But I hope we get a lot of value out of it and once again
 If you guys can go to Lindsey Stirling concert support, she's amazing and she was such a huge addition that she was fun-locking live
 All right, let's keep the theme song and then we come back. We'll jump right into my live Q&A with Lindsey Stirling
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet
 Still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Was that amazing or what?
 What an awesome way to end out this extraordinary last four days together
 It's fun because we were planning since for like in live ends
 We start to think like what's the plans for next year and so
 We were just talking about this and I was like, yeah, I want something to end where we can just leave on like cloud
 Nine everyone's got the energy and everything and we should have a concert and then we're like well
 We've never done that for how that even works and then I don't know if you ever talking about before
 But we started talking about different names who would be possible and then we said your name and everyone on my team is like
 If Lindsey Stirling could come that would be the most amazing thing ever and you guys experience that the most amazing thing ever like
 So great
 Thanks for having us those you guys are amazing as I said, thank you so much for your energy and
 It sounds like it's been an amazing week
 Cool I want to take the message to interview because we were actually in trying this earlier today, but we ran out of time
 And so I wanted to do this just
 Partially because I want you guys to connect with her more and be able to follow her more and I'm gonna talk about that towards the end
 But also just and help so everyone understands like some of her journey because her journey
 I think is very similar to a lot of a lot of your guys journeys as well
 So I think my first question is
 Where did you come up with?
 Such unique thing like there's people that do violence people do dance
 But I've never heard of anyone besides you who did both like how did you come up with that?
 You know I funny
 Fact I guess about me is a lot of people asked me what came first violin or the dancing and the thing is I've played my
 Violin my whole life has started when I was six. I did not start dancing until I was 23 years old
 And I'm a self-taught dancer and so it's very ironic that I've always loved dance
 And I thought it was just such a beautiful art form
 And I wanted to make my performance as a violinist more engaging than just you know
 I always felt so stiff and so I really started working on incorporating
 Movement into my performances, but you know the funny thing was is I had this vision of being a dancing violinist and I couldn't dance and
 You know and so I think it's so important to like you know
 Whenever you are starting out on a venture or a journey whether it's an artistic one or a business one
 There are things that you're gonna be like, but I don't know how to do that
 How could I possibly be a dancing violinist if I don't know how to dance?
 Well, I started step by step by step in a very literal sense teaching myself very simple choreography
 that just started with like a look and a wink and like a little shoulder
 You know just very minimal movements and now I can literally do back bends while I play and I can spin
 I can learn choreography and it also was just step by step and because I had such a clear vision
 And I was so determined that for you know sometimes the less you know in a way the better it is
 I don't think I realized how difficult it would be and so I naively just went into it with everything
 I had and worked tirelessly until I could do it. That's amazing very cool
 So
 So my next question is before crystallize like blew up for you and you're going through and you're I'm sure you're practicing and doing
 Things and videos and all sorts of stuff and it
 Things weren't blowing up for you first off like how long was that period time the second off?
 What was it the kept you going like moving forward at that time as opposed to just like throwing it in walking away from it all?
 Yeah, I probably started to pursue you know and like write my own music and you know
 Make this art of dancing and playing and I probably worked at that for two years
 Before I even discovered YouTube and during that time I had some I had a lot of times that I've kind of fell on my face
 Sometimes literally sometimes just more you know figuratively speaking
 One of which was extremely public it was in front of millions of people on America's got talent. I was
 My little artistic heart was absolutely broken on that show. I felt like my my my spirit was just broken
 I was so devastated at what I thought was going
 I thought this was going to be the biggest moment of my life and like what changed everything and I ended up getting
 Absolutely publicly humiliated, you know and told in front of millions of people on live TV that I sounded like
 Strangled rats when I played the violin. I was told that I didn't have what it took and I should try something else
 I would never make it
 And that was one of the hardest things to get over because I was literally terrified to step on a stage again after that
 I was like I just don't know if I can face that kind of
 Humiliation, you know it was in the back of my mind every time I would go to step on a stage of like I am probably gonna fail
 But so I took a little break from it
 Just to regather my confidence again and to work on my craft
 And I realized I think the most important thing about that story which took me years to realize is that they told me you're not good enough
 And
 People now always are like oh America's got talent. They were so wrong about you
 They like they missed this diamond in the rough and looking back on it that no they actually were right. I wasn't good enough
 But the most important word was left out. It's that I wasn't good enough yet. I had
 I had literally just
 invented this idea of dancing and playing a violin and I hadn't put in the time yet. I wasn't good enough
 But I just began once I realized that like I'm just not good enough yet
 And I worked for the next like year and a half honing my craft and getting good enough so that no one would ever
 be able to say that again and it wouldn't be true and
 And I also think there's this inner gut that guides you and sometimes you get to a point and I've done this in different ventures
 Where I realized this isn't a path that I should pursue anymore
 I think this door is closed and it's time to go to a different one
 But this door I knew that it would open I just felt it and it was I just need to keep going because that inner compass
 Will never lead you astray and to me that's that's God and you know
 You can call it whatever you want whether it's like you but universe talking to you and guiding you
 But I do believe there's something so much greater than ourselves that guides us gives us inspiration and gives us that like
 Courage to press forward
 Spinning
 Spinning up here
 So those who want to know more about you
 I know back to my mom's down here my mom in the middle
 She's like my mom's like have you read her book yet?
 We tell them about your books so if people want to learn more about you and your life and everything
 I love you to tell them about that having all we can have them all go buy the book tonight
 There you go
 My book is called the only pirate at the party
 it's a
 very
 Thematic of a theme in my life where it's based off a true story where I went to a birthday party that when I first moved to LA
 And it was a Peter Pan themed birthday party and I was really excited and I was like oh my gosh
 I have a pirate costume. This is perfect
 I'm gonna make so many friends and it was that mean girls moment or I walk into the party and it was a
 Regular party like nobody was dressed up and I was a full-blown pirate and I was like like I had the hat
 I had like a tin foil hook I made so I was captain hook and I was like there was like a Tinkerbell cake
 I was like the only thing that let you know maybe this was a themed party and I remember there was that moment of like
 No one's really seen me yet. No one really knows me. I could get my car and I could go home and no one's the wiser or
 I could just own it and go into the freaking party and try to make some friends
 And I decided to go in and make some friends and like kind of laugh about my and I met a lot of people because I was the only pirate at the party
 But it was just such a like you know what this seems like it's a little bit of a theme of my life
 And that's why the book has all these stories of I mean
 It's not like any of us walk through life trying to be like I'm different. I'm I'm the only pirate
 You know, but I think we're all different
 We are all so unique and those are the things that make us wonderful
 They're the things to be celebrated the joys the hardships and it all leads into our story
 And so that's what my book talks about it talks about like my experiences going through an eating disorder and depression and America's got talent
 and all these like times when I hit the bottom and
 Through my own gifts and uniqueness decided it's time to get back up again. Awesome. So everyone going Amazon to get that today
 All right, so my last question for you is revolving around operation around railroad
 So I know you've been involved for a long time with them as well
 You know a chance to watch the documentary so last year at this event in Orlando was the first time we introduced this world to
 To Tim Ballard and operation around railroad we watched the first documentary
 We raised just over a million dollars during that event
 Which is insane and amazing and then Tim actually flew from our event to Haiti to pick up his kids and then flew back
 Which was which was so cool and so I know you've been involved in for a long time
 I love to hear some of your thoughts about about what they're doing and the importance of and kind of have you you're getting involved now as well
 You know, I don't like I get chills just thinking about it the documentary was so like I don't think there was a dry eye in the room
 It's I think what they are fighting is the greatest evil that could possibly happen
 It's the greatest evil. It's the plague of our time and I don't think there is anything that is more important than freeing people from slavery and
 Tim's book is amazing slave stealers if you haven't read it. It's on audible. You can listen to it as you drive around
 But it's so
 It you know
 I've written a lot of music based off of my experience of going through anorexia and depression and I do a lot of these
 You know metaphorical images and music videos about being trapped and they were to represent a time when I was like literally trapped like a
 prisoner inside my own mind and
 That was really really hard, but it just makes me think like my next mission
 I've told that story now my next mission is to talk about how people can literally be trapped
 by somebody else and
 You know what I think the greatest thing about having a voice and having success is
 That then you get to pick you know you get to tell your story through my book through my music through my art
 but then I also get the opportunity to help other people tell their stories and
 Each one of you as you grow your business and your brands and whatever it is
 This is giving you not only a platform for the things you're passionate about the things you work so hard for
 But it's giving you a platform to share whatever message you are passionate about and I'm super passionate about
 Operation Underground Railroad. I'm so excited
 I was so excited to hear that they were a part of this event and that you guys support them
 And anyways, it's I can't think of a greater cause off. Thank you
