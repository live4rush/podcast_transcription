 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back the marketing secrets podcast. I've just finished day 500
 I think I'm at 60 or 70 interviews
 Two huge webinars publishing my face off in the middle of the corona crisis and I'm curious
 Have you been taking advantage of this crisis as well?
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still
 remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome the marketing secrets
 All right everybody so
 Obviously right now everyone's kind of in this weird thing and some people froze and people are are running some people are
 Everyone's got a different a different perspective
 But I want to give you guys a glimpse of a perspective right now that hopefully will shift some things and change some things and get you
 excited and thinking and and
 understand the possibilities so
 Right now obviously so many things have shifted and changed for people
 But you look at like what is business of the core if we take a step back, right?
 He hasn't heard me say this before it's not it's not unique, but it's my my beliefs. I feel like
 Businesses is a calling right it's calling we get from from God or from whatever you want to call
 But it's like this internal nudge we feel right if you've ever felt that pull or that desire
 Alex Sharfen calls it the call of contribution you feel it's called contributions like I need to do something more
 I need to be something more I got to figure something out
 If you've ever felt that before which I'm assuming if you're here if you're listening to me
 You've probably done that otherwise you wouldn't have gone on a path that got you researching things subscribing to things and listening to podcasts
 Like if you didn't feel that pull you wouldn't be here
 So I'm guessing and assuming if you're here you you felt that before you're like I need to do something
 I don't know what it is, but I got to create and I got to serve
 And then like what most people do say go about it backwards. This is definitely what I did for the first
 About five to ten years my business was I'm gonna go create a product and then I'm gonna go figure out to sell the product
 I'm gonna go find people to sell it to you
 But the opposite is true like what we do is we we fill this calling and the calling is you've been called to serve this group of people
 Right, it's not you you've been called to create this product and bring to the world
 It's there's this group of people that you are uniquely
 Think like you've been given gifts and abilities to uniquely
 Change and serve this group of people right like your life experiences the ups the downs the problems the trials
 Everything you've had to this point in your life has been given to you as a gift to be able to change the lives of a group of people
 You've been called to serve right and so when you look at business
 That's what businesses is like we need to gather people together and listen to their needs and figure out how to serve them
 I think that's like that's what businesses when you boil it down when you when you get rid of all the fanciness and the terms and the
 And the strategy and everything it's my job is I've been called to serve this group of people
 I'm gonna gather them together and I'm gonna help them and listen to their needs and figure out what they want and figure out ways
 I can help them right so that's what business is if we if we if we boil it down and so right now
 We're in this time where people have been disconnected. They're they're not gathered there. They're pulled apart
 They're separated back into their families. They're pulled out of these you know all these things and
 You look at our job as a business owners. What is it right now?
 It's to gather the people to gather together to listen to them to figure out how you can help me you can serve them
 It was crazy and this is why I wanted to talk about taking advantage of opportunity right now like right now
 Two days ago. We did or soon as yesterday
 So yesterday I did a webinar. We ended up having 19,000 people registered for this webinar 19,000 people
 I've never had a four that's a world record for me by far. I guess never happened in the history
 But it happened 19,000 people registered for this webinar. They showed up and then on this webinar
 They they we all sat down and we shared and I taught and we gathered and I you know
 Did my best to teach them and then then we made an offer and people bought things and it was really good
 Right I listen to their needs and figure out an offer that would match their needs and did our best to create that
 And so but what's interesting is the 19,000 people
 Man a month ago we would we would spend anywhere from three to five to eight dollars to get someone registered for webinar for this webinar for this gathering of people
 19,000 people we're averaging 78 cents per opt-in 78 cents
 Okay, my ability now to gather people
 Together is it such a huge huge huge discount
 I understand some of you guys have all the pieces in place yet to be able to buy ads and things I understand that if that's the case
 I just like now it's time to start studying these funnel things and getting together so you can profitably generate
 Funnel if you haven't seen it man if you want to see this is if you go to secrets masterclass.com
 If you go through that funnel that's the webinar
 I'm doing the live again next week so you can still go and watch the whole process
 But go to secrets masterclass.com you register for the webinar on the pop-up
 We ask you like what are you struggling with these struggling with funnels?
 You struggling with conversion or you're struggling with traffic and basically pick you go to a different landing page
 Where I offer you either the dot-com secrets book the expert or the traffic secrets book?
 It was crazy those 19,000 people are registered. We sold over $50,000 in those three book funnels from that from that window
 That's it means for every person registered for webinar. We made three dollars
 So I'm paying 78 cents. I made three dollars and then the webinar happened and the webinar we sold
 You know they know we sold the quick funnels
 But what's crazy is 19,000 people gathered together so my job is to gather people together
 I can do it now in a discount that I never could before it's not gonna last forever
 But man we're in a season right now
 I got I used to always say I wish I could go back in the day when Google was cheap and easy
 I wish I could go back in the day when Facebook was easy like like right now we have this window where it is again
 It's it's crazy
 I was reading articles showing that Facebook's gonna lose like $40 billion in the next quarter because
 Everyone's dropped pulling their ad costs out so ad costs are dropping so it's like oh my gosh
 Like this is this really unique window and I'm hoping for most of you guys you realize that that if you're if you're
 Gathering your people during this time at whatever level you can some can do it to pay it out
 So you can't that's fine, but but your job is business owners to gather people and you can gather people right now to discount
 People are silently begging to be led Jay Graham told me that two decades ago
 But still true today. They're silently begging to be led if you'll stand up and gather those people together and let them plug into you
 Right now you can do it at a discount that man has not been around since I've been online
 It's all you understand that and so now like don't sit inside lines. This is the game
 We're in the middle of it
 There's some people who you know whenever this ends in a month for now a year from now five years
 I don't know when it's gonna end but on the other side of this who are gonna be like man
 I wish I'd taken advantage of opportunity
 So I'm here to tell you like take advantage of the opportunity go all in figure this stuff out
 Like this is the time for all of us to to be stepping up and gathering our people
 And serving them, you know and it's funny. I was on a interview with Tom bill you the
 founder of quest nutrition founder of impact theory and at the end he asked he's like what's your what's your impact
 I was like what is it you're trying to do? I told myself like I feel like my role in this whole game is that my job is to gather the
 Gathers right and to give them the tools and the resources they need to gather their people and so like if you look at that
 Like that's my role. That's my job, right?
 So I'm gathering you guys together and I'm trying to give you a place of faith and comfort and only like things are okay
 This is where we're going. This is the future these are the opportunities
 It's what you're not seeing right now
 This is what you should be looking at and trying to share those things and giving you tools like click-thon some books to give you the tools
 And then all everything you need to be able to gather your people and then I'm trying to be a perfect example
 This is how you do it like watch what I'm doing and do what I'm doing like
 I'm trying to make something you guys can model so you guys can do that and you go out there
 And you do the same thing you gather your people together you listen you give them faith you give them hope you give them inspiration
 You create tools and products and services and things that are gonna help them to to do whatever is that they're trying to do
 When you guys understand that like that's the game. That's the business we're actually in
 It's to gather people listen to their needs and then to serve them like that's business and right now you can gather people at such a discount
 At prices we've never seen before
 We understand that it's like now is the time to take advantage of this opportunity because if you do that man
 How much further ahead are you gonna be in a month now six months for a year from now because you're able to to get the
 Ear of people that you couldn't before so and I hope to help some of you guys who are wondering what to do or how to do or
 You know wondering what your roles are in this game. That is how it works
 That's the game. It's so much fun to play and I'm grateful for the opportunity
 I have to be part of this with you guys and to be you know an example as imperfect as I am
 But but example of like how I would do it if I was you because I'm due to the way that I do it
 And hopefully you guys can get ideas and model what I'm doing, but that's kind of my goal from this
 So anyway, that said I'm done. I've been like 60 something interviews this week or this last couple weeks
