 What's up everybody this is Russell welcome to the number two of our funnel hacking live at recap
 I hope you guys are all doing amazing today and
 Hopefully I like the first recap of what happened on the first day of fun. I can I now we're gonna jump into number two after we kick off the theme song
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody welcome back so
 As you saw day number one was insane most people told me like we could go home right now
 And we got our money's worth in a whole bunch more
 I said I know and it's only the first half a day wait till you see what we got in store for all of you guys
 so day number two
 Was Thursday and it's funny cuz like I was so tired I said slowly night before some of us worked in Africa going into everything
 So my very first presentation I wanted to do the first presentation to get the main people in the doors possible
 That seems to help a lot
 And so I did one and there's supposed to be on traffic secrets
 Which is with the new book on running right now and I did a whole event on traffic secrets you guys know
 And I was really excited for it. The only problem is as I started
 Like I think because I prepared so much for the event and I'm like oh this will be really easy to start teaching it
 So I got a stage and the very first thing we did is we made
 Vince Palco and Ray K built a really cool
 Comic book that kind of joked about how Mark Zuckerberg Zainos and how he's been snapped his fingers and half the entrepreneurs traffic will
 Disappear in the world kind of modeling nearly vendors and we watched that it was a comic book
 We gave everyone on the seat and then we also watched
 Watch the the actual video we made from it was so much fun
 And so I was the first part of the day and then I did my presentation on traffic secrets and I gotta tell you like
 Those who were there I'm so sorry like I've like I was up for probably 30 minutes teach in this concept
 And like I just got flustered my notes out of order and like it wasn't as clear my head
 Because I hadn't thought about it
 I thought like oh I thought this will be really easy to teach and just kind of I don't know
 I was off my game
 That's the one like 30-minute window the whole event when I was like angry
 So I was like I feel like I dropped the ball
 I was like dang it and then and then what's cool is when we were working on this really cool
 software program to go with to go with traffic secrets and so
 Stu McLaren who's my partner in crime on this project he came back out and
 Like literally saved me from this presentation. So he came in start talking energy was high
 He just nailed it
 He was so much fun and went through we showed this new software
 Which basically helps you to find your dream 100 and collect their data and watch their ads and I just really get understand and master
 Dream 100 right and and it was cool as we were gonna give it to everybody
 We were gonna sell it well
 We kind of played like we're gonna sell so main offer
 I was like first you're gonna get this and this and this and this and this and then I was like and it's gonna cost you guys just
 $6,000 and then it's like and I wrote $6,000 on the whiteboard. She was like no no no
 Let's do it for cheaper and cross it out right it's like 1997
 I was like dude you make me look bad at my events like I'm when I cross I'm like how about
 997 and she was like wait a minute I got the microphone what if we do this for free and they start to like an Oprah
 Moment, you know she does like a car you get a car you get a car and gives her free cars
 He does this Oprah moment. He's like you get a free you know for being runs in the audience and like people are laughing and crying
 And it was so fun
 So we actually gave everyone the software the beta version the software for free
 Which if you're listening to this and you want to get it
 It may still be open if you go to fill your funnel.com you can go and create it
 It's a really cool chrome plug and let you go and start doing
 Bill not your dream 100 which is really fun. So that was the first part of the day, which went really well then
 Excuse me that got fun stage and then we had Natasha Hazelet and
 Kristin nickel get up and
 Natasha kind of pioneered this concept of a challenge funnel which you guys have seen the one funnel a challenge which is our big main focus right now
 I learned that initially from Natasha and so I want her to speak and she was pregnant with twins now
 What's crazy is she was about to have the baby she
 So many funny stories here, but she actually lived in Boise. That's how I got to know them over the last few years and
 And then I asked her to speak like alive on challenge fun. She got excited and said yes
 And then she's like oh by the way Russell. I'm pregnant with twins. I'm like what and I was like
 And it as like she's like I'm pretty much do the same day
 I'm supposed to be speaking but she's like I'm gonna go
 She's like I know that God's hands in this because like I'm literally like we're moving and we're moving to Nashville
 Which is what the event happens to be she's like I'm gonna be in Nashville with my family
 I can come and do it so she gets on stage with twins like almost ready to have babies
 I get teasing she was gonna have babies on stage and it's funny last year um
 Rachel Peterson was pregnant on stage like I and like almost gave birth on stage like I I don't know what's happening
 Keep like um
 You know asking the amazing woman to speak who I don't know the time are pregnant so I find out later anyway
 But what's crazy is that Natasha actually had the babies like um like three days later
 So like it was it was like literally she about to have babies
 But she um she killed it did an amazing job
 And then one of her clients that she's worked with is Christy nickel
 uh, Christy
 Her her nicknames code red christy code red nickel and code red nickel got up there
 And then she showed how she did a challenge funnel and she didn't know anything about funnels or anything
 And she went from living on food stamps to get two comic book award by using one of Natasha's challenge funnels
 and then and then um, I think Christy got on stage and she is
 Insanely motivational. She's got a big old blue mohawk
 and um
 She's just so motivational she got on stage and just like told it how it was said things to everybody
 I wish I could say to but I can't and it was it was amazing
 Oh, and those two just oh they killed it and I think it got people so excited about challenge funnels
 And then also just got them pumped and rising their excuses don't matter and um
 That that duo was it turned out. I was nervous having it's always hard having two people on stage
 I was nervous about it
 But man they choreographed it and just did such a good job. It was amazing
 Then after that then we had uh bailey
 Richard who bailey is one who did our 30-day summit and she's doing a flute boot camp summit right now
 She did a whole presentation on virtual summits and i'm not gonna like I I think bailey's an amazing person
 But I'd never seen her speak on stage and she was probably the biggest unknown for me
 like ever else I kind of seen present in in some format except for her so I was nervous and um
 And she stepped on stage and she just owned it and it was she did such a good job
 And it's cool because we showed him virtual summits
 But not only did she talk about what virtual summits were she had showed the numbers in in great detail
 So all of my analytical people in the audience were like freaking out
 She was like here's the numbers and how much here's where they offered she be in the price point and that the conversion and like just all the stuff
 Of virtual summits how they work and it was amazing. So uh, anyway, so grateful
 I've heard coming in her share all behind the scenes of how she runs virtual summits
 Like I said, we've done the we did the 30 days dot com virtual summit. We're doing affiliate boot camp
 Right now and so this this um, it's funny because I actually built my business initially you doing virtual summits
 So it's kind of a it's kind of a full full full circle now
 Um, you know having her come and teach these things now and bringing in new generation teaching how to do summits
 Which is still one of the best ways to build a list quickly. So bailey did awesome then after that
 um
 Dean gracios he came on indeed if he has no dean so when I was back back in my junk mail days
 I was collecting junk mail. I used to also watch a lot of infomercials indeed was on infomercials way back like 20 years ago
 And he's been on tv every day for 20 years until a couple years ago. I think he he stopped but he's on tv every single day for
 for decades
 selling versus his first info product
 They sold infomercials called motor millions have like by cars and flip them and they started in real estate after that
 um
 And um, anyway, I some I studied him
 I used to watch his infomercials like people watch movies and I take notes on him
 I just loved it and then I had a chance to meet him a few years ago and I joined his hunter k group just to get no one better and
 Um, it's been super cool person great friend and just someone I had a ton respect for
 um
 And uh, and so he came and again, it's amazing all these speakers come for free like they all they'll donate their own time and energy
 but he came and um, it's funny because
 He's got his book millionaire success habits
 And uh, he was selling them not through infomercials. He was selling them through
 Um online and he never had social following off
 We started this thing from scratch, but dean's just like a pusher like he's like I gotta get this
 I gotta figure this out. I gotta crack the code
 And so he sold eventually sold a hundred thousand books through through instagram and facebook
 And he thought that he'd burned the market out and he was kind of tired and he's like no
 We got some more we got some more to get pushing it kept reinventing himself creating more videos more
 Creative and and they got point where it was like he sold 200,000 250,000 then 300,000 right now
 They just passed 500,000 copies of their books sold through social media
 Um, which I think made everyone just like oh my gosh like if we just push harder become you know
 Get better marketing stamina, which is something dean said they get more marketing stamina
 Um, he'll be able to push these plateaus and actually and actually sell your stuff
 I think most people get tighter their marketing message way before the market does and dean's proved 500,000 buyers like these keep pushing
 Um, yeah, you can do it. So he kind of showed his model and how he does it
 I remember we um dean and I swapped consulting days a little while ago
 And the biggest takeaway got from him when we were there is that he just puts out way more creative ads than we do
 Like like more ads than we do like we were doing like two new ads a week
 He was like oh no, I do two a day like he's like I have my phone with me
 I'm making ads everywhere I go just like the more creative you need to be able to sell like he had more ads
 And so that was kind of cool then after he got off I came on stage with him
 Just tell a story about a new project he's working on he's working on a software product him and tony robins called mine mint
 And he explained to me like that's really cool. I was like you create masterminds with it
 He's like yeah, and that's like we should buy mastermind.com. He's like well
 He's like he's like it's it's not for sale. It's I went to mastermind.com and whoever owned it was a two common club winner
 I was like oh my gosh like dean that you have to have this and so we we talked to mission
 They wanted a million bucks for it. I told dean. He's like i'm not gonna pay a million bucks for domain name
 He's like mine mint is fine. I'm like, uh, I'm like, but you need this like this should be your thing and so um
 and so uh
 Dave
 Woodward of my team he went over and negotiated with the guys and got it down to i'm still like $600,000
 We I think it's the way in that for somewhere in that in that window and then um and then I went to tony and dean said hey
 Here's a gift and I gave them mastermind.com is a gift
 Which was insane and then dean was like this is too cool and then him and tony talk that they end up giving
 Me giving our us giving quick funnels equity in mastermind.com, which is launching in like a month from now
 So it's kind of exciting so mastermind.com
 Is uh, we announced that kind of from stage and told people it's happening and told the story behind it and um
 It's kind of fun and how cool is that? I could be part of the dean and tony on a business. I love it
 So that was fun. Um, there's a there's a secret dream 100 strategy for you guys by domains for your dream 100 and give it to him
 And uh, depending how big dream 100 is it depends how much you're gonna have to spend for that domain
 Anyway, all right
 So that happened then everyone went to lunch
 Then um ray higden get guy who went with spake and spoke and ray
 Ray serves the network marketing industry
 He I've known him for probably seven or eight years now when I spoke him at the very first network marketing
 But I ever spoke and I met ray and just like fell in love with him and every time I've ever heard ever heard him speak like
 There's something about him like you hear him speak you just like you just love him each one like
 He just I'm amazing human
 And uh, I invited him to come to this uh this mache mama
 I did last year called the pirate's coke mastermind
 I just provided like I think I invited six or seven people to it and
 Ray is when people invited to it and it's cool
 He came to it and on the flight over he's like I probably should read russell's book because I have never read it
 So he read expert secrets on the flight over and then we started talking and then he had this idea for this this new community a paid community called rank makers
 and um
 He kind of you know pitched that I that concept of the mastermind then he went home and he executed on it
 And it's like a $20 month continuity program and he talked about how he's because kalen kalen
 Poland spoke last year about how to build a culture. I had to build tribe and community
 Um, and he wanted to come and speak like how to pay bill to paid tribe a paid culture paid community
 And he showed what he's done with with rank makers and it's so fascinating
 He's doing the network marketing space, but the model what he's doing could work in any industry
 And he shared how he did it and how it worked and the numbers behind it was just so cool to see that so Ray just crushed it again
 um
 Then after that then I had jammie cross come up because it's funny everyone always tells me like russell expert secrets is just for people doing selling
 Physical products or excuse me selling info products and I'm like no it works for all business
 You're you're missing the point and jammie was it fun?
 I can live two years ago heard me talk about perfect webinar
 She sells soaps and oils and things like that and instead of doing what most people did and like oh, this doesn't work for my business
 She said how could this work for my business?
 So she showed the perfect webinar tried to do it did like a 90 minute one and it didn't work
 And she did like a 60 minute one didn't work. She kept tweaking it till eventually she she created a version
 It was a five-minute perfect webinar. She launched it and boom went from from where she was out to two common club in less than six months
 Um, and so I wanted her to come and talk about ecommerce funnels in the perfect webinar and she did and she killed it
 She crushed it. She shared this five-minute perfect webinar that her and jammie had already built everybody
 And um it was so fun to see her on stage and prove once and for all that
 Um, you know that this stuff works for all types of businesses
 It's not just info products like you take these principles and these concepts and make them and tweak them for your business
 And jammie was willing to do that put in the effort to tweak it and and and her business blew it because of that
 And then having her come back and show everybody was just one of the coolest parts that they've been for me
 So cool and after that then my man and a partner here at click phones john parts came up and talked about traffic and he
 He liked in traffic to like the greek gods and all this kind of thing. It was really cool and he made it
 Um, at first I was watching i'm like kind of confused he's sharing cats and dogs and all these things
 There's like, uh, and then he like used all the foundation
 He did with all these these stories and to build out like this really cool thing like oh, that's how retargeting ads
 Can work in a really simple and really easy way and um, it was it was fun seeing them on stage as always
 Uh, which was awesome
 Then um, then ryan tawd and me came on stage talked about click funnels
 Uh, uh, called about, um click from the state of the union
 We actually called the presentation becoming a diehard funnel hacker and we talked about all the new things are working on the new updates
 Um talked about the team and just kind of showing up right behind the scenes
 What's happening at click funnels and then uh, we tried to get everyone to upgrade to action SMD
 Which half the ides already was that so they said run back and they get a free t-shirt and the other half
 We could convince most of them to upgrade to action SMD as well
 Which then they got a really cool shirt that said diehard funnel hacker on it had a bleeding heart on it
 And the back is that hashtag i bleed funnels, which is really cool
 And so we got a bunch of people to upgrade to action SMD
 Which is one of the you know one of the missions of fun lacking iver every years to keep people to
 Understand what we're doing and then also hopefully get them to upgrade to action SMD which is really cool
 Now for that then we had a round table so all the two combo club x members
 Um
 All of them, but i want to be with one two combo club
 Um got a table i think we had 20 or 30 people out there and then everyone had a chance to go and eat eat free food
 Uh hanging out the round tables and ask all the two combo club wouldn't any question they wanted
 Which was really cool when people loved it
 Um, which was awesome and then during that time i actually went up to my hotel room
 And i took an ice bath, which was crazy
 So brand new mr. Shard who um brand and spoke it twice and i'll talk about his presentations here
 On the next episode, but he told me he's friends with usher and he said usher taught me him this trick that's like
 He's like um and brand new to these big huge long like three and four day events when he's on stage all day every day for four days
 And he's like i started doing ice baths and nice and i have the hotel deliver how much ice to me and then he said what happens is um
 He said by day four. He's like my throat is thrashed my body feels the same as it does on day one
 And so i he told me that a couple years ago so i keep joking with Melanie my assistant i'm like
 Hey, we should get ice in the rooms which ice in them and then every year i was sat i don't do it
 But this time i told her that and she booked ice i totally forgot about so like we had done
 With the with the clickfowls day union dress and mrs. Like hey, they're delivering ice to room right now
 i'm like
 Oh, no, like i don't know if i actually really want to do this like that sounds horrible
 And so um, it's funny. Anthony klemani who's uh my
 Biohacking buddy was in the audience and so i text anthon i'm like dude
 They just deliver ice to my room i needed an ice bath and want to come help me like coach me through because i'm kind of scared
 And he was like, yes, i'm on so we go to my room
 And uh, they fill my tub with the coldest water possible they dump in all of the ice
 They said that i don't know the temperature was it says less than 30 degrees or something crazy
 And they coached me through it said he had to get in but times and start to their head goes under
 If i had to get in put my head under and then they start timing and then i was like dude
 I'm dying that and then anthon is so funny like he jut he like rips his shirt off
 He jumps into the coach me through it so we're both in the tub freezing and we did it staying for like over five minutes
 And then i had to put my head back under again before they the clock stops or something
 He's like sitting there freezing that's finally i can
 Put my head under and they jump out and he's like when you jump i get to scream like
 Ah as loud as you can i jump out screaming as loud as i can
 And i think it was close to six minutes in the ice, which is crazy. He said most people the first time we do about two minutes
 So i did get there
 But it was painful and it was horrible, but i actually did feel really good the next day so
 I did ice baths that night and then we passed out
 And uh, that was that was the end of of thursday. So
 Um, anyway, again another amazing amazing i remember it then i was like
 We've been here a day and a half in the event and look what everybody's gotten so far like it is
