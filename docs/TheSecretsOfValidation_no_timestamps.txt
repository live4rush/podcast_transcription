 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome you to another episode of the marketing seekers podcast this one
 We're staying in the affiliate
 event I got so many more cool things to share with you guys and I want to talk about the concept that was brought to my
 attention again called validation
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome the marketing seekers
 All right, so at this affiliate national mine group we're getting our top 20 fillets were there and one of the people who came was an unlikely
 Person on our leaderboard I say I'm likely because I didn't know much about her prior to this
 But now that I know her it's very likely she is
 She there's a reason why she's successful and I hope she knows that if she's listening it's but
 But it's Julie and if you guys watch the affiliate contest
 She saw it and she did awesome throughout the contest and she came in and ended up being on the top 10 leaderboard
 And it'd be like number four I believe in this contest and she just become the first click-thong affiliate to win a car
 Julie's story and a whole bunch of other just awesome stuff and
 It was interesting and she joined this contest. I didn't know these things
 It was in the middle of her moving she was middle of her own product launch bunch of stuff and she started going and
 And she started
 trying to be part of this this this launch and help support us and
 Throughout the launch first off I guess I didn't know this
 you know a bunch of people who've been Facebook live so me and she wanted to Facebook live and I guess she reached out today and
 and asked me it's like I can't like Russell got like 30 a day and you just can't do it and
 you know and rightfully so she was kind of upset about that and
 Little where why later, you know other things happened and she kind of blew up and it was funny and it was first time
 I've been she'd really been brought to my attention. I was watching her videos. I was just like I
 think man, you know, she's killing herself trying to help support us and like I was so grateful for that and and
 Tonight she was upset, which is always adds a little layer of whatever
 And I was reading through the I saw her video and I was just like first. That's kind of hurt like oh man
 And then she didn't comments the morning start reading
 I was like I think you should something she kind of dropped it like in a comment like you want to let me do an interview with him
 and I was like
 She's wanted an interview. So I just posted like do you just want to do an interview like we can do that and show back?
 Yes, I'd love to I'm like, okay
 That's it. Let's just do an interview that we find and and we end up doing the interview
 And she sold a bunch of books and she kept doing it
 She had to be in number four and she came to the event
 She was talking about like I think the top 10 or 15 different things that she learned through the Philly contest
 Which was really really cool. I'm not gonna share all of them because you know, obviously want
 You know a lot of the stuff that was shared at the event is private for those who were who were there
 but one of the things that was interesting
 She talked about was just validation and how
 us
 Valet how how me and Dave would run a team how us validating her is what got her to keep moving forward
 And I'm a show like clip really quick. She has some kind of just hear her say in her words
 Why those so important because interesting and I want you to hear that and then we come back on to kind of talk about that
 Because it's important so many so many aspects of our life. So let's watch that clip right now at one point in the in the contest
 I was angry
 I was really angry because I had asked for an interview and I didn't get one
 And then I saw other people getting one who were like further down the list than me and I was just I was mad
 And I felt like I was missing out and I was my feelings were hurt
 but I was angry and so I posted on Facebook and I was mad about the $20 bid and and I also didn't understand the context of the whole dream 100
 Because I had never gotten any of the other packages because I wasn't part of Russell's dream 100
 So I felt like I was in this ridiculous game where the rules were changing and I wanted their attention. I wasn't getting it well Dave and Russell both
 Validated me and from that moment on I went from like I don't know if I want to do this
 maybe I'm gonna quit to
 I'm yours forever like it the validation that happened that that
 that moment of being able to reach out and say I see you I see what you're doing. I'm appreciative
 Do you want an interview change like I had all kinds of motivation that I never had before so in my own business?
 When I see my customers and my clients
 Floundering but they're really trying and I'm not talking about the trolls and the thugs and the the people who are just like the complainers
 but like the people who are really trying and they're they're just like drowning that
 One seed of like hey, I hear you
 Could change everything and that's what it did for me because I was like ready to quit and then Russell and Dave reached out
 and I was like not quitting and
 It completely changed it for me when you guys reached out. I was I was done
 so in
 Business that matters to me and that's how I think I've created customers for life in my own business
 And why I got as far as I did it's interesting huh how how us validating her got her to go and and do these things into and to do stuff
 And I start thinking back about my life in fact Brandon Fisher who's
 You know one of our main video guys he talked about us too as well like
 Like what I validate him or something validates his work or whatever it might be how powerful that is and a lot of times
 And I forget this and I wish I was better at it
 but a lot of times like your employees or your spouse or your kids like a lot of them are doing stuff because they
 Because they love you and they appreciate you and they and they want you to be happy
 I think sometimes pushing the business world, you know, we caught up and I look at what they want
 They want to raise they want to you know think about that because it's like the monetary side of it a lot of times
 It's a lot of people like that's that's important obviously, but like it's more important sometimes its validation and like saying hey
 Thank you. Hey, you did a great job. Hey and
 And I I don't I'm not perfect that I struggle with that. I wish I was I wish I was better at that
 but it kind of brought it back to like my attention and
 You know I feel like the team that we built a click funnel is a second to none and
 And I feel like one of my roles
 I need to become better at is validating people and just thanking them for what they do and like telling them they do a good
 Job things like that. So I'm gonna making more of a conscious effort of that
 to do it more often and
 because man like it's been interesting is I've built this company with my team like and
 Even I said the word I right there said I'm in building I felt like that's not true as like
 Is that weird like I was like that wasn't true?
 So let me step back like as we've been building click phones because it has not been me
 It's been a team an army of the most amazing people on earth
 Who have built that together
 A lot of times people think it's me because like my I'm the you know the bouncing monkey like oh
 Good click funnels, but you know I'm just one little one little piece of this this machine that's been growing and it's like
 All times I get validation from the market
 So it makes me feel good
 You know people like my comments they comment or they share whatever and like I get the pat on the back for a job
 Well done, but for the rest of the team like they don't they don't necessarily get that unless it's coming from me
 You're coming from somebody else and so I think some of that I forget that because I get the ego boost
 I mean, that's why I mean I was thinking like why do I why do I share so many videos?
 Why do I do podcasts? Why do so much stuff?
 It's like I like the validation
 I like when I put something cool out there and people like dude that was awesome like I get that validation and
 I think too often I don't give it to people who are
 the rest of the army behind what we're doing and and
 a lot of times my family of my kids my wife and so anyway, it was a good reminder for me it was humbling and I
 Hope it's good reminder for you too. So that said thanks again for listening to this episode
