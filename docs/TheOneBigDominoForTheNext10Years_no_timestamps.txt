 Hey, what's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson and this is the last podcast of this decade
 New Year's night nears Eve and in a few hours is gonna be next year and next decade. So that's that I want to give you
 One thought to think about
 As your building company over the next 12 months
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Everyone
 So we are packing up right now taking the kids downtown for New Year's
 Here in Boise they have a potato drop literally they have this huge potato and they have a big tractor come out and they hook the tractor
 This potato and then the potato drops
 Just like you New York City get the ball drop. We're gonna potato drop. So we've never seen it
 We're going downtown Boise to experience the potato drop. We're pretty pumped about that in a really weird way
 So that's gonna be really fun and then we'll see how the kids make it to midnight or not
 so that's kind of what's happening tonight and
 It's interesting because I was like thinking about to to share kind of for the last podcast
 You know, I thought it'd be fun to do like the top 10 things I learned this decade or this last year or whatever and I may so
 So do something like that, but
 It's a we're kind of packing the house down and I'm getting ready to leave one thing he's going through my mind is just
 It's actually simpler. It's not it's not a whole bunch of things
 It's like one thing for you guys to think about so I want to share that. Hopefully it'll it'll help somebody right now and in whatever
 you're looking at so
 it kind of stems back to and probably seven eight years ago I was in New York at Joe polishes genius network event and
 In Tim Ferriss was there and I never seemed Tim Ferriss speak before I was kind of excited and he's not say he's talking and
 He did some Q&A and stuff and I remember at the end somebody asked him some question like like what's the question
 We should ask you Tim that you know, we haven't asked you yet or something like that
 And he kind of thought for a second
 He said you know, it's interesting is he said that I get reporters all the time who want to follow me around all day
 and
 And like you know day in the life of Tim Ferriss
 And he's like I always tell him no because like if people actually saw my life was like they'd be really bored
 He's like I wake up in the morning
 And you know, I drink some coffee or some tea and then I sit and I read a book and then I think and I and I you know
 All these things he's like he's like I'll sit there sometimes for days or weeks or sometimes even months just trying to
 Identify what are all of the dominoes out there?
 And then what's the one big domino that if I knock down that domino, you'll knock down all the other dominoes or make them obsolete
 And it's like because I it's like I don't do a lot of stuff when I do something I execute on it perfectly and it's this huge thing
 So anyway after after he said that I thought a lot about that and I think
 The most part I'm not I'm not really that way like I'm more like I'm moving forward all the time
 You see like I'm moving forward. I mean I did after I did I'm and I'm and I've been you know
 executing on this funnel this fun on this idea in this book and this thing and like and we're moving fast
 And I think that's that's good, especially when you're getting started
 I think it's good to be trying testing a lot of things and tell you kind of identify what your thing is and and
 Really figured out
 But something that's been interesting over the last couple months as I've been writing these books and doing these things
 The one thought he's coming back up. It's like
 You know
 I'm doing a lot of things that
 Incremental you're helping to grow the company
 But I was like is there is there a thing is there like a big thing if we were to do it or execute on or knock this domino down
 That would that would shortcut us five years or ten years or more and get us there faster
 And it's funny because when I thought like you know
 I was thinking about that like there was not like a funnel like it launched like this is the funnel little 10x clickfuddles
 This is the funnel little speed up at the time. This is the book. I need to you know
 It wasn't ever anything like that and so I at first I was like I guess there's not there's nothing
 I could do that'll shave off ten years of our success, you know and get us ten years
 You know further down the line faster and and so for a while we thought that wasn't possible because we were looking through the
 The lens that we normally look through and so
 Because that we weren't able to see you know seen answers that but then we started looking at the lenses and different people's perspectives
 People that are smarter
 I mean people that have done things in different industries and looking at that and we started looking all of a sudden
 It became apparent that there are a couple paths that would literally
 Take off a decade of growth for ClickFunnels we could we could get
 You know where we would take us ten years going the direction and the the path there right now
 We could get there within a year from now and first we're like that can't be possible
 It doesn't make any sense
 But because we started asking that question looking through to different lenses outside of just our own perspective
 It started opening up all these opportunities I did in this whole new world of things that are possible
 So I'm not able yet to tell you what the answer was for me and that shouldn't matter because the answer for you is probably gonna be different
 But you will see it play out over the next
 12 months of my life and the life of ClickFunnels and you'll be like oh my gosh
 That was the move Russell chose that's interesting that that is how he's short-cutting a decade
 And getting it done in a year and so you'll see you'll see the strategic moves that we're making and they're exciting and they're fun and they're
 They're awesome, but I'm sure I will talk about it as the pieces come out and I'm able to share more
 But more so I wanted you guys to start thinking about that my guess is when you start thinking like what can I do right now?
 That's gonna propel my business forward a decade in next year
 You're probably not gonna see it right away
 It's gonna be hard for you to you know
 you're like because
 Given the tools you already have the answers not there just like for me given the tools of like what's the next funnel?
 What's the next book? What's the next you know the thing the answer wasn't there?
 It was it was me
 Keeping continuing to ask that question and open eyes and giving it a lot of people who have a different frame of reference in different lens
 that opened up these possibilities to me and
 To us as a team at ClickFunnels and so
 Anyway, I want to encourage you guys to ask that question and then start looking for the answer because it's there somewhere
 It's not within your immediate
 Ability to execute on it, but it's there somewhere. She's got to start looking for it
 And if you if you search for it my guess is you're gonna find it so anyway, that's the thing
 What's the big domino? What's the big nominal for you guys?
 This year that's gonna propel you forward a decade think about that
 And then watch as we start executing ours. I'm excited
 I'm so grateful for all you guys and the fact that you listen to this podcast the fact that you use our software the factory
 My books the fact that you care means the world to me and I'm just grateful for you guys during this

 It's gonna be fun. So thanks for being along up for the ride appreciate you all have an amazing new year
