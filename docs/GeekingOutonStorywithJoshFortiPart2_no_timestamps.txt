 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast
 so today's episode is
 Probably from most my conversations with Josh might have been one of my favorite
 It was really fun
 We start talking about experts secrets and storytelling and how they work and and I tried to character profiles
 Which one you should be using and how they work and can you change them and and then also he started going into his concept of the master story?
 Which is something I talk about in the perfect webinar, but he
 Goes really deep in it and anyway, we geeked out. This was a really fun episode
 I hope you enjoy it with that said I'm a cute the theme song and we get back in a chance listen to this exciting
 conversation with me and Josh talking about
 story and attractive character and much other really cool things
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money for our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way? But let's us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome the marketing secrets
 I gotta ask this do you are you not on Twitter like I see you on Twitter a lot and like I see your posts and stuff on Twitter
 but
 Is it not is it not you that's engaging on Twitter? No, I don't know how to tweet
 You don't know how to tweet. I'm not a brussel. I tweeted you a lot or not a lot
 But I tweeted you quite a bit. Oh, hey, and then sometimes you like my tweets. I do like it. They're awesome. Yeah
 Oh, man, I personally I I really I enjoy Instagram probably my favorite and then Facebook's probably number two
 That's the two social platforms. I spend my personal time on the most
 So if it's from those two platforms, it's usually me if it's
 Other places. I do you have it like broken up like are you like
 Instagram I do this type of content and stuff on and Facebook. I'd like do this type of content on or is it kind of like a mixture of both or
 For you personally, I mean, yeah team most of it the one place
 I really post new stuff typically is Instagram like stories like that's what I kind of like me personally doing stuff and then
 Facebook on my personal page probably once
 Every once a while I drop stuff there and everything else. Yes rare. Yeah, no not often
 Yeah, you're not like me who's like what it's been 48 hours without some form of controversy. What can I say? Oh my god?
 All right. Well, actually I kind of want to talk about that though
 Not so much controversy, but creating content specifically around storytelling because I think this is probably one of the biggest
 Let me give backstory a little context around this I
 I came into the world completely backwards of what most people do right?
 So I was the guy that came into the world and most people have no following and no followers
 And they can't get leads to happen right and they don't get anybody to show up to their webinar
 And then they're super depressed because nobody showed up and nobody bought I have the exact opposite problem
 I had everybody show up and nobody bought and let me tell you that's way more depressing
 You know why because when everybody shows up and nobody bots, you're like crap now
 I really unscrew because I have no idea what's going on right?
 Right it's not because nobody's hearing it is because I actually suck and I remember the first time
 I ever did a webinar. We actually I don't know if you remember this or not
 I actually sent you a snapchat. This is right when you first got snapchat
 This is way way back that I've told this story before and I went and I was like Russell like what's up, man?
 I'm trying to build this webinar like how much would you caught charge me to like to build out a webinar for me or whatever, right?
 And you sent me a little a little video a snapchat video back. You're in the Jeep and you're like
 Hand out really do that, you know, I don't really do that anymore
 So I like snap you back and then you snap me back
 You're like it'd probably be like two hundred fifty thousand dollars or something like that
 But but I don't really do that and I'm like man
 I really wish I would have hired you for two hundred fifty grand. But anyway
 So I go and we do this huge webinar and we had everyone told us we're like we're gonna have all these people sign up
 And everyone's like no no you're not like nobody gets people to the webinar that easy like you maybe have a hundred registrants
 We had two thousand people register and we had a thousand people we max out the room is thousand people on live at the pitch
 There was like 982 people in the room. I go through I do my pitch
 No one by not a single person and then like we hung up and like an hour goes by and one person had bought and like
 Most miserable depressing like crap. I thought there's no sound or something. Maybe they hear right right?
 Right, but like I sat there and you know that it was a bad webinar
 We had like dozens probably hundreds of emails and comments of like can I have my money back for a free webinar?
 This totally sucks like worst experience ever like it was just it was awful right and what was interesting is that really scarred me for a while from doing presentations and from
 You know doing anything where I pitched live and so I basically went and I just did set sales from that point on
 I did lots of presentations
 I did lots of content
 But I did not actually go and pitch because it was I was it was it really it was like PTSD almost right
 I was like I don't want to go back there
 And what was interesting is I went and I would do sales and sales like I got good at sales
 But like sales is hard man like sales a this is a different game
 It's just like pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing right and then like
 my brother died and out of
 Just sheer not knowing what to do. I just started sharing my story because like at that point you're like
 What what do you do like my whole life is messed up at this point?
 I'm so confused and so I just start sharing like what I was going through and I start sharing like things of like the emotions
 Am I what I'm learning and like what I'm going through and like I remember people just started buying and it was like the weirdest thing
 Because I wasn't selling anything right but I would go through and I'd be like you know
 I'm super grateful and thankful to have an audience right now because like you know
 I'm you know able to go through and have a business that allows me to go and like be mobile and go to my brother's funeral
 Or whatever and then people started buying my programs
 And I was like what in the world and I would share other things and then people were sorry
 But and I'm like I'm not actually selling these things
 I'm just talking about my life and what was interesting is I went back eventually later that year and I went back to all these different people
 And I was like why did like why did you buy this product and they're like well
 Because you told so such such a story. Oh, that's interesting
 I went over here and I was like why did you buy that product and then like well you guys told such a story
 It was a completely different story
 And it was like they were buying because they would hear a story and they would associate my like that story with a product
 That I was selling they would go buy and so I had all these different products and all these different stories
 And I was like okay, well, I got to figure out like what's the one story that I want people to figure out right like it's
 So I saw the one product
 And so that's like what I've really been focused on recently but like that
 Lesson taught me that storytelling was everything because I had heard that from you a million times
 Story story story story right and I'm like I'm telling stories Russell
 What more do you want me to do but I wasn't I was telling facts
 And I was trying you know going out there and trying to sound smart and when I just let go of it all and was like
 This is the story like the real the raw the genuine like I'm not trying to sell you anything like this is legitimately
 What's going on in my life?
 I mean more money more money like in more sales than I had before and so I would love to it for you to talk about like
 I know in experts because you go through of like
 Storytelling and all the different you know the core four stories in the change of all police
 But like what what's the key and maybe that's it like going back to you know through that and that's fine
 But like what's the key to telling a good story because I think not only do people and there's the follow-up question to this
 Which I'm not gonna tell you what it is yet, but like what's the what are the elements that make a good story?
 What actually makes the story work and how do you tell one effectively?
 Yeah, it's first off as fascinating because like I went through a very similar journey when I got in this world too
 I remember going to my very first event. I saw people selling from stage and
 Seeing the numbers and doing the math
 I was just like this is crazy
 There's no way this actually works and then I've ever get invited speaking of seminar and it was different
 Because webinars are painful, but man standing on stage and doing a pitch and then it bombing was even worse like cuz
 It's just like
 And it was just like in fact I remember I was like I'll never after the first one
 I'll never do this again
 That was the worst experience ever and that's what I joined the Dan Kennedy world and did this this public speaking course
 It was like 40 CDs
 I remember the pack was like this thick CDs and I bought it cuz I was like I I want to figure this thing out
 I started listening to him and I don't remember the course at all other than this feeling of just like it's not teaching is what
 They teaching is not what gets people to buy
 When you're on stage, it's telling these stories and connecting with people and it shifted my mindset
 And so it shifted the point where I went and tried again and next time I tried I tried to weed these things in
 I got like six cells a thousand bucks piece. I was like oh
 Okay, like I got the the reward of like this actually worked
 And then I was like we can do it again and do it again
 And then you start getting obsessed with it
 And I for me like most of my education for the next five years because there wasn't a lot of people had courses on public speaking
 Things like that there were a couple but there wasn't a lot is I just went and
 From a timeline it was a time it was before the the big 2000 whatever the big crash doesn't aid
 Whatever and so there were events happening every single weekend
 So I'd go to an event every weekend and I would sit there
 I would just watch the people speak and I would like watch what they were doing and then see how people would buy the end and
 People the ones that had the big table rushes and stuff
 I was like okay with what they just do what they do to me
 How do they do it what they say and I was like trying to like dissect what they were doing and they would model that for my
 Presentations and I like oh I can they did that part of how they told the story how they got emotional or I should like like just studying
 You know, but called Jones calls a Christmas hacking
 I didn't know that's what it was this time
 I was just watching how they did stuff and how made me feel and it wasn't just like selling from stage
 I started watching
 You know religion people as well like like some of the best
 presenters in the world are preachers and pastors and things like that and
 I was watching like just people speak and how they got me to feel and move and like how they told stories in a way that
 That was exciting and then so that's like this study. I started going on
 Then I met Michael Hank. I started learning about story structure. I was like
 There's not like this is just like made up. There's like actual structures and there's things in place and like this guy way easier
 Because now I'm just guessing there's actually a pathway
 Anyway, so that's kind of my my history with the two minutes fascinating
 But I think that like if I was to break it down into like something for people understand
 It's not complex but simple because you can go into the extra secrets book and get really complex
 But the simplest form is if somebody's coming to you
 It's because they're looking for something different right they want they want they want change
 They want more they want some there's some result and I was thinking about this like on a mountain like there's there's
 Because dad Kennedy used to talk about this
 He's like he's like you need to become the guru on the mountain and people are gonna come to the base of the mountain
 The closer they get to you up the mountain the more they're gonna pay right
 So the base of the mountain they pay a hundred bucks a month for newsletter
 Then they want to get close to the pay 500 bucks a month and a thousand bucks a month and you know for whatever for 50 grand
 They can sit at your feet and to talk to you like he's always talking about that guru on the mountain thing and back back when
 When I was for studying this the way people sold was different
 It was much more like that like it was more of a status play like this is like so successful
 You should come up here and if you want to be like me you gotta you gotta you gotta come to me
 You know pay me more money and I never really resonate with that
 Partially because I'm awkward. I always feel awkward like like
 transitioning myself. Yeah, I never liked that and so I started learning about story structure. It was cool because I
 realized that like the the position of you on the mountain it gets it's essential right but it's not like
 You sell from the top about yelling down to the people
 It's like people see you on the top about and they're down here
 Like I want to be up there
 Yeah, cool
 And then it's you coming down off the mountain running down to where they're at be like okay
 I know exactly where you got let me let me tell you and they tell you my story
 Right because I was in your same spot at one time right and that's the power. It's like so if you look at where do my presentations
 I usually drop for like one slide or one thing like like hey
 This is the thing you want right like cool
 I mean you know whenever like I'll do my quick posturing just so they know that I've been to the top about to try to get to
 But then I don't I don't stay there
 But again if you watch the old-time speakers from the from the 90s and early 2000s like they would spend that you know
 90 minute presentation talking about them on top of the mountain the whole time and I was
 Hated so I like I drop real quick
 So like you know that I know I've been where we're trying to get to but I got to come back very very quickly
 And the story I'm telling you is the story my story of them right like I have to put myself in their spot
 Like where was I when I went through the same thing because all of us if you if you got top of the mountain somewhere
 You had to like start hiking and you went through that that journey to get to to be the guru on the top right?
 It's like coming back and like remembering like who where they at or where were you at tell your story?
 And if you tell the way that they connect like oh my gosh like I'm in this like this perk like they are me
 I am like I was rustling Russell went through this he understands that there's empathy
 Then they're like then they trust you then they want to go on that that journey with you
 That's like when you came out you start telling your story
 Right it wasn't you posturing a position how great you were but it's like I can't do this thing
 You're trying to figure out but let me tell you my story and how I'm struggling how I'm still struggling and struggles
 I went through the pain and the fear and also they're like I feel that too. I feel the pain
 I feel the fear like I understand those things this person understands me
 I can trust them to take me on this journey because he's not gonna be the person who's just
 Positioning you how great they are at someone who I have empathy with they understand me
 And that's the key because if they feel if they feel like you understand them
 Then they're gonna go on that journey about journey with you and you do that by telling the story
 Like your your version of their story because they're living it right now
 And you've lived in the past you got to tell that away where they they connect and now they're gonna want to go on that journey with you
 And that's kind of key to it all
 That's super super interesting and yeah, cuz like when I think about story structure
 Because I've like tried to simplify things down in my own head because it's it's always interesting because like I'll I'll
 Watch everything that you do and so funny whenever I do presentations people are like you're a mini Russell
 I'm like well that makes sense actually right like I've watched all this stuff right so but for me
 Man going through expert secrets. I don't know it's probably the third or fourth or probably maybe fifth time through before I finally actually was like
 Oh, yeah, you actually do know what you're talking about because every step of the way I'd be like
 But my story doesn't fit in that doesn't work or like mine doesn't have that or like
 It's not that systematic or Russell. There's too much of a science
 There's more of an art to it and then I would like I'd read about it
 And I'd be like this is so scientific and I'd watch you do it and I'm like that's so artistic and I'm like
 But they're the same right and I was like so I would try to figure out ways to like simplify it down
 So I can understand it and then once I would understand it
 I would plug it into yours and then it would work right and so for me it was always like okay
 There's four parts. It's how did I get here right? That's back story like how do I get to work right here right now?
 That's like that and then it's where am I going right so like how
 The goal the desire and then it's how am I gonna get there?
 There's a vehicle new opportunity right and then it's also gonna look like the vision like what's it gonna look like in the
 Process of all that so we can paint this thing we get people motion attached
 And so like for me and my brain and they don't always happen in that sequential order
 Like sometimes you start with the desire and then you go back
 But it's like it has to have all four of those parts
 And then I would take that and I would go and then I would apply to the expert secrets and then it'd start working
 Right, I was like oh my gosh
 That's what Russell doing here and here and then you actually had this whole like framework out about it
 Right and I think one of the things for me is I would go because I've done we've done book clubs on expert secrets
 I've got you know
 I teach stories in marketing I teach stories in you know personal development like stories and storytelling is like a big part of what I
 Do now especially over the last six months and moving forward one of the questions that like continues to come up is
 Well, there's two parts. Let me start with the first one
 Hey Russell, but like that's all great, but I'm not a leader. I'm not I'm not the attractive character
 That's the leader, right?
 I I'm the purse
 I'm not the person that figured it out and like I'm living my customers journey
 And there's actually a lot more of those people than I thought
 I thought most people were leaders because that's what I was when I first got started so
 My question is is do you tell the story a different way or how is the story different?
 How is it positioned differently if you're not the leader because I know you're not in your story
 You're the reluctant hero, right?
 And so I tell people I'm like before you start figuring out your story
 You got to figure out what attractive character you're gonna be right and we go through the four inside of expert secrets
 It's like there's the there's the leader. There's the adventure. There's the reporter, right?
 And then there's the reluctant hero and what's interesting is early on in my journey. I was the hero, right?
 I was the one I was like guys. I was literally this broke kid
 Freaking living in a $500 a month apartment, you know duct tape windows and now I'm not right like an Instagram was the thing and social media
 And here we go, right?
 But as I evolved and like the podcast came and without even realizing it I became the reporter, right?
 And so like how it how does based on your attractive character? How does that change the story or how you tell it?
 Yeah, and it you know, it's funny because mine's transformed not only just throughout time but in different situations situations as well, right?
 Like sometimes I'm the attractive, you know
 I got started saying why I was an interviewer so I interviewed people so I was a reporter for a long time and then I transitioned like a reluctant hero
 But there's other times like a fun hockey live. I'm not the blue-relected hero, right?
 At that time I've got to be the hero like I'm coming in and I'm like setting authority because I got a whole group of alphas in the room
 And if I don't like I'm in there is like it's like the head alpha like they will run me over like it's
 Like in a situation with Tony indeed like if I'm in that situation
 I'm transitioning more back to reporter because like I'm leveraging I'm leveraging Tony's expertise and things like that
 So like I'm coming back as a reporter say the day I can't hear it now
 You look it's fascinating like we've bought Danny Kennedy's company, right?
 We launched the first Dan Kennedy new offer by the way if you're listening go to no BS letter.com and go sign up
 But um, yeah, like Bob. Go ahead. She you go through my lane. Yeah, but look at like how I
 Sports last Josh for you. Yeah, if you look at like how I position this offer right?
 It's not me coming as like Russell's the alpha right?
 I'm coming back in like this is my mentor boom and like I had this chance to acquire
 But I'm gonna go through 40 years of his stuff and I'm bringing it back to you
 And I'm like I'm pulling these things out and this one I look from Dan and one I'm from down here
 Right and it's me coming back like in a reporter role with my mentor and that's how I'm introducing the world to him
 So like it shifts right it shifts based on the story and the situation like what are you using it for?
 Right like I could have came in to be like because there's a different posturing like I could have came in and
 Bend the hero and like I bought Dan's company. We're bringing it back from the dead
 Like put on me, but like that story first off didn't feel good the second off
 It's like it's not the story
 I think is it get people to move the stories to get people to move is like is me getting hobbitched in this guy
 He's changed my life and out
 I'm gonna be have a chance to bring these things back to you like and like that
 You know me becoming the reporter back in that phase in that business and that side
 Is a more powerful some more powerful story to use right? And so it's all coming down to like figuring out
 What's gonna be the best story right in this situation like and where you're at and thinking through that because you know
 Right now you're in a reporter role, but other times and you're I still see you you shift back over where you're you know
 You're running up and things and so it just trying to figure like what's like and these are all tools
 I was talking to my the two comic club ex members this week and
 You know some we have some like part of groups doing challenges part of the webinars part of doing different things
 And they're like which one should I do which was the best of my notes?
 It's not what's the best these are tools like this is a hammer
 This is a saw in different jobs in different tools
 So it's like if I'm coming in here
 I want a hammer but over here. I want a son here
 I want a hammer and a saw cuz I'm gonna do the thing right and same thing with stories understanding that like like your attractive character can
 Can shift it mines shifted more throughout time and also
 Situationally it shifts where it's like hey, this is this is the role I need to be here and and it's okay to like to shift back to
 Reporter I've seen people
 In fact well, can I drop names? Yeah, who cares? So like Grant Cardone's a good example like I love Grant
 Grant is like the leader, right and at 10x after I you know
 We sell these sales records
 Ground was gonna was gonna shift to the interviewers get interviewed and it would have been a really fascinating thing for him to pick my brain
 And ask and we sat down we got the thing and he sat there for second and also
 He was like he didn't want to he thought like shifting to the interviewer was a was a decrease in status
 And he literally stopped before he starts actually I don't want to interview him
 I've some else to do he got off off the little thing had someone else come in that person interviewed me and I was like
 Ah day get like it would have been so powerful for him
 Come on Grant
 It's so powerful for him for him position for people to like to to connect with him better if he would have covered off like that
 I'm Grant Cardone
 You know trade come down for a second and done the report and been excited because he generally was excited
 He backstage was freaking guys like I've never seen what you said that was amazing
 Like it was this cool thing and like it humanized him for a minute and he could have had that moment where he did it
 Where's like me right now Kennedy like I'm trying to I'm paying all hobbits to dad
 He's amazing and it first off makes the offer better makes the story better
 But it also makes me more people connect because now it's like they're the same thing like oh my gosh
 Like I have met towards I can I can be excited about what they're learning
 I don't have to posture all the time where it's I'm the only I'm the only person you know I mean
 Yeah, well, it's super interesting that you say that because
 Studying influencers has been something that I've kind of geeked out about and like
 When you talk about one of the things you talk about in there in expert secrets or whatever is the attractive character has flaws
 Right and when when the attractive characters owns those flaws. It actually makes the their
 Like supporters love them more and what's interesting is that I like I've looked at people like Trump
 And we're not trying to get political here in any way she performed
 But like one of the big criticisms of Trump even from his own people and I being one of those is like he never admits
 What he's wrong. He never will step down and like even give the idea that somebody else could be right and because of that
 That actually hurts him a lot more in the long run than in the short
 You know like that then then it gains him in the short term
 Right and so it's like same concept and then I look at like someone like a Dave Portnoy
 Right and I don't do follow Dave at all Dave Portnoy. Okay, so he's a founder of Bartuels
 Sports and he's the one that did the barstool fund and everything like that wherever here's a dude who like I mean
 His fan base is like not as large as Trump's
 But like as far as like fans and fans like people love
 Portnoy, right like I mean there's this man
 But he makes fun of himself constantly right and he's constantly coming back and like being like yeah
 I messed up all of his bets are you know public because he owns like a gambling or sports betting company
 So like you go to his Twitter and it's nothing
 But all of his wins and then all of his losses right and so you can see boat and people just love it and any time like people
 Are trying to bash up on him like all of his supporters comment. They're like yeah, we know he's an idiot right like he's
 But he's amazing idiot. Well, yeah, right and so it's like when you show those that other side like people connect to you even better
 And it's such a fascinating concept because it's so it's opposite of what our brains think you know
 I mean I don't say it's counterintuitive like we want to always posture position thinking that's the it's just like the guru on the
 Mount we talked about right like like in the 80s 90s every expert wanted to be the person the infallible expert up here at the top
 But man, that's not what gets people to to connect
 It's like coming down and like dude I struggle to like I remember the pain
 I remember the pressure the fear the scare like all those things and that's what connects people like people create connection now
 Or maybe there's a time in the history people just wanted the the other thing
 But nowadays it's not that way people connect with vulnerability
 and it's hard to scare because it's like
 In fact Natalie hots, I think she quoted me Brown
 But she's what it told me that she's like she's like when you're vulnerable
 You feel small but people but people looking at it. It feels it makes you feel big to them
 Yeah, I feel horrible, but it makes them look at you and like oh my gosh
 This person's willing to yeah really to say things
 I'm thinking of my head and I don't dare to talk about because of my own fear and anxiety and
 Status and all those kind of things that it gives them that that thing and that's what gets people to connect with you
 Fascinating
 Yeah, for sure for sure. Okay last piece on this which will take up the rest of the time for sure is
 The number one question that I get hands down when it comes to stories
 I'm sure you've heard this a million times, but in the odd case that you haven't Russell your people want to know this okay
 the number one question is
 How do I know which story to tell? Oh, it's good, right?
 like it's the hardest thing because people are like and
 It's always hilarious because I'll sit down and I'll be like well
 What story are you trying to tell and they're like I don't know and I'm like well
 Here's your life story and I will tell them because I'm like their coach
 And I'm like you know been around them for six weeks or whatever it is and I'll go here's your story boom
 Boom boom and I'll summarize their entire life in 30 seconds and they're like how did you do that?
 And I'm like because it like well anyway
 I want to know the answer to their question
 How do you know what story to tell because everybody has they have these we're so close right and for me
 I'm about to turn 28 right my 28th birthday from a big birthday basketball. It's coming on it's gonna be great
 We're gonna walk through podcast. It's so cool right, but it's like I got 28 years worth of experiences
 How do I know what yeah, it's fascinating when I wrote the first version the experts secrets?
 I didn't know that was the question people had I didn't know how to answer I didn't never cross my mind and
 Anyway, I wrote the second version the experts secrets and like I'd seen it so I'd updated it
 But nobody ever commented and it wasn't until
 Actually, did you you came to it? You came to the to the x the most recent fan event I did right that the expert
 Yes, okay. Yeah, not not the not the e-com
 Yeah, so the first time I shared that publicly was at that event and I remember it was fascinating because Stephen Larson
 Just probably one of the people that have studied me the most and he like raised hands like oh my gosh
 It's like I finally understand what story it's supposed to tell and I was coming from Stephen who like I was like
 interesting so
 This is the problem
 I think that and I I always tell you like tell your backstory tell the origin story so they're like okay
 So I was born in Provo, Utah March 8 1980. It was a cold night and they go back to there right like
 Yeah, sorry, I told you're origin story and it wasn't a tell at that event again
 I I think I'm pretty sure in the second version the hardbound version doc up secrets is in there
 But it was that event where I really said I said the story you're telling is not like your origin story
 It's your origin story of how you came upon or created or figured out your framework
 It's that it's your interaction with the framework. You're sharing. That's the key right?
 It's like when I'm talking about the perfect webinar for example this the origin story
 I'm telling is not my origin story. It's my origin story discovering this framework
 So for example like I went to our rewards event and I saw people speaking on stage
 I did the math and I spoke on stage
 I look like an idiot and I went back home and I bought a Kennedy's course
 I realized it was wrong and then I went through the thing and so it's that it's that story that help
 That's how I learned or I earned this framework
 How did I how did I come up with that? What was the things I went through to like discover this gem that I'm bringing now
 From the top of the mountain down to them saying like this is the thing I found out and this is this this is the story
 About how I found it let me share it with you and then I want that gem
 I want that that gold nugget and then they come with you on the journey to go and get that with you
 So that's the that's the most simple way I figured out how to explain I'm curious on your side because you've explained
 Verses as well like would you add that a changer or would it cut your
 Well, so
 Let me start by telling you the biggest struggle that I had like I'm talking like for over a year of reading expert seekers
 I struggled with one specific thing that I could not figure out
 And it was like the question that I wanted to ask you for the longest time and then like right before we got on interviews
 I figured it out. I was like oh my gosh
 But it was I didn't understand the difference between the backstory and secret number one
 Yeah, and what I meant mean by that is like to me. I'm like
 First you discover funnels and then you teach them the framework for funnels
 It's the same thing, but then you would say they're different and I'm like
 How right like I don't understand how like the difference between those two things now at first
 I didn't understand it at all and then my kind of my first epiphany or my first breakthrough was oh wait wait wait
 First the backstory introduces the thing and then secret number one has the framework for the thing
 Right and so like then that was like kind of my first realization of like okay. These are separate
 It's one is the thing and then the framework for the thing
 But then I would look at your webinar and I would go
 Russell Russell what's your framework like what's the framework to build a funnel?
 I'm like it's hook story offer. That's what I thought right?
 I'm like it's that's how in order to build a good funnel. It's hook story offer and then I was like well
 Maybe that's not the framework. Maybe it's maybe it's at all the upsells and break the beliefs and then go through and what and I was like
 but no matter what it was it was never like the framework for building a successful funnel was never to go and
 Like model somebody else's funnel and then build all the up
 I'm like that's not it like that's a thing
 That's but that's not what you would that's not the parts of a funnel right and so I would I got confused because I thought
 The framework that I was supposed to teach in secret number one was the parts of the thing
 Not the framework for how to build the thing right and so I think one of the biggest
 Like one of the biggest aha moments for me is like each part of the
 Each part of the webinar that you're doing is its own separate section and like they build off of one another
 But they're also each standalone right and so I thought that the back story or that the story that I told in the back story
 It was the story through the entire webinar and it's not right and so like I was like whenever I would hear you say
 Well tell the back story about how you learned it and how you earned it
 I thought it was like that was the story for the webinar and then I had to go through and tell each thing
 And when I realized that there's a separate there's a separate story for each thing
 Right there's a separate story for the back story
 And by the time you're done with the back story and this is how I think it was you that said it might it I
 Go back and forth. I really like how Dan Henry
 Explained some of things specifically when selling courses because one of that was the other problem was you were selling a software
 And I was like well what happens if I'm not selling a software crap like where does it fit in right?
 But like I think it was you that said
 By the time you're done with the back story. There's a percentage of your people that are ready to buy and I'm like whoa
 That's the story that I've got to figure out and so for me
 I was like what is the story that I have to tell that if I were not allowed to tell secret one secret two or secret three people
 Just took me at my word that what I said was the solution to their problem
 What's that story that I have to tell that people would go and buy and like I became obsessed with that and that's what I call a master story
 Because I'm like to me and that's why I was you know telling you like we're geeking out about it
 I'm like to me once I figure out that and I've gone through and taught all these students like how to teach stories
 If I focus all of my time on the three secrets
 We never get anywhere like literally like it's ridiculous
 We'll spend so much time and then they'll do the presentation and it won't work
 But if I spend 80% of my time on just the back story and we get that right
 They basically figure out the other three secrets like that and I spend like 20% of my time in the other three secrets
 That's fascinating. Yeah, cuz I spend most of my time doing the three secrets because that's people get stuck on my side
 But that's but it's it's man the way you frame that's really cool because I think about
 There's different markets I go after right?
 So if I'm going after I can begin a market my my first thing is telling potato gun stories
 It's like I have to go to me an upsell no no like and for beginner like which 100% by the way 100% of I've done
 The last like six three months. I've been doing sales calls like crazy whenever I mentioned the master story
 I go hey guys, you know, Russell. They're like, what's the master story? I'm like, do you know who else a bronson is?
 They're like yeah, I'm like, do you know the potato gun story 100% of the people say yes every single time
 They're not by a single person like that's his master's right when it comes to fun. So anyway, that's
 Dinsley cuz like I have a different master story if I'm going over like a more advanced audience, which is
 the master story of no VC's right so it's like
 like
 We're competing against a fusion software always things that hundred million dollars of funding
 We didn't have anybody we were broken so we put this thing together and then like now we get customers for free
 And then they buy a separate and like that master story is what sells it to more of like the corporatey like the
 Business owners who are who think through the world of like investing so that's the story that I leave if I talk about
 Tails with them there they're their loss, right?
 You know so again, it's like people like but I only have a story
 It's like no you have different stories like one of the stories that fit the audience like Dan Candy one-on-one
 Message to market match like how do you how do you connect these things right?
 It's like here's the market I'm talking to in fact
 I think you know this we bought we bought do lead calm and we bought like Brad Council company
 And these people I didn't realize the time I thought they were internet marketers using software to make sales videos
 But no, they're actually course creators who don't know anything about marketing
 So I went to my webinar pitch to these people and it bombed
 It was like the worst together and I was like what and it's like oh my gosh
 I didn't understand the market and so I had to change it
 So we rewrote it change the story change the the thing to match the met the the market
 We're going after and now it's converting really well
 But it was like it's just understanding that like in every situation like figure out okay
 Who's who I'm actually speaking to so there's the market and what's the message the story the thing?
 I have that's gonna match that to then bring them into into our world claim
 So the same product no matter what there's different right different story that's gonna hit different message in different markets as you as you go through
 You probably hear me quote a lot more Dan Kennedy in the near future
 As I'm going through all this courses again right now and having the time of my life with it so
 Yeah, well, it's just interesting just going back to that one concept of like
 The the first core story right the master story the backstory of it all I
 Think one of the big problems that I know I ran into this is once again
 I thought I thought the whole webinar
 Was designed to like teach and educate
 When in rate like that's when I would introduce and teach the whole entire process
 But it's like it's not like secret one secret two secret three are designed to educate on the thing that you introduced in the back story
 Right and I for me with the people I work with it
 You know on a pretty consistent basis. It's like they don't understand that either and so when I go in and I'm like no
 No, no, no forget about teaching them about it
 Like you have to teach them what it is why it's so important
 I always go back to that story when you were like, you know
 No one was buying it and then you're like do you understand like how would I went through that?
 I'm like that like guys that's what you're trying to create. It's like forget forget the framework for it
 Forget how it works forget why it worked for them forget the external objections for a second
 Whatever like what do you have to do then like for it if you didn't get to do anything like that
 How would you convince somebody that this is like the most greatest amazing thing and then be like and just take my word for that
 It's gonna work for you like what's that story that you would tell and like for me once I identify that that was what it was
 And I started working on my students with that
 All the rest of the webinars and five day challenges and everything became easy
 Whether it was Catherine Jones when we worked with her whether it was Brad Gibbon casual tactics
 Whether like all of them it was like once we figure out that then all the rest of the things fell into place
 Yeah, it's fascinating because like
 Like I always that was the reason why I bought when I first started versus when I started studying dance stuff is is that
 Realization of just like they haven't bought into the fact that they want to funnel yet
 Or that they want weight law or whatever the thing is like your only goal during the webinar or the challenge
 Whatever is to convince them that this is the vehicle that's gonna be the the most likely
 Success to get up on that mountain and get the result that they're looking for because they've been looking at their results for a long time
 Right, I think Kalen said the average woman goes on eight weight eight diets a year, right?
 So it's like not that I oh my gosh. I'm gonna lose weight
 I just thought like this oh my gosh. I'm gonna make money. Oh my gosh
 I'm gonna like they already want the result
 They try through for the things you're trying to convince them your presentation or challenge or whatever is convincing that that have all the different
 Potential opportunities that your new opportunity is the one that's most likely to get them success
 And if they buy into that then you can take them on the journey
 But like you know you start to get around the gate you're trying to take them on this journey
 They're like wait, but there's like ten other options like well
 I don't think you're the right I don't even get the right option
 I have no idea like so your job and your role is
 It's 100% only there to convince them that this is the most likely thing that's gonna give them the success
 They're looking for and yeah, then you want like that's the that's the then you can bring it to world now
 You can serve them now you can change their life
 But until you've sold them on the fact that your vehicle is the one that's that's most likely to give the success
 You can't serve them. You can't change their life. You can't do anything
 And so that's what we got to become really good at is that transition. So anyway, so fun
 All right, well that'll wrap up the story episode there. I think that was really really good
 I think we got a lot a lot accomplished
 We should go another time another next time your voice we should do like a half day live with everybody on like the master's story
 That'd be fascinating go deeper just on that without the context of having to have all the rest of the webinar things
 I'd like I'd love to geek out with you deeper on that. So there's a thought here's one more that you got to let me and Josh
