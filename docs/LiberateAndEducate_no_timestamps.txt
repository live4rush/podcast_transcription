 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson. I'm in the middle of a village in Kenya right now
 And I wanted to welcome you to the marketing secrets podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answer. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everyone, so I am about to start packing at my bags after spending three days here in a little community called the DAO
 I'm probably gonna pronounce that wrong
 And it's been a really special trip. This is actually so those who don't know this is my third time
 Coming to Kenya we came the first time in 2012
 And it was the first time I'd ever been in a country like Kenya
 And it was this emotional crazy experience and we fell in love with the children and the people here
 In fact, we met a little girl here that first time her name was Jane
 who became
 almost like a like a daughter to us and
 As we went home we ended up keeping communication with her and
 She was I think 13 years old at the time and that was the first time I came to Kenya and then
 Two two and a half or two years ago. We weren't really planning coming back again, but
 Actually Dylan Jones is one of the co the initial co-founders of ClickFunnels. He was supposed to come on a trip
 I think you forgot to get his shots or something in time
 I don't know what it wasn't so but we still had our shots in four years earlier still raging through our blood so they
 they let us come back and so we
 Or they needed someone to take the spot that Dylan paid for so we like the weeks
 No, it's jump to came back out and just just came for three days just to be with the kids and it was amazing
 we got there and and
 Jane who graduated from from the from the school when she was going to secondary school which is like their high school and
 And so she came back to the village and saw my wife and it was just like this amazing emotional experience
 I'm having to ball in your eyes out and crying and
 It was just it was it was an amazing experience
 I was two years ago and then fun-lacking live two years ago
 We we made an offer where we said hey if you guys want to actually come to Kenya with us and build schools with us
 you can do it so
 We had about 15 or so people who each who each paid about $20,000 to build a classroom in Kenya and build a
 And so collectively was enough to build an entire school and we were supposed to come out last year
 but on the trip was set at a time there there turned out to be some
 Some political elections and things we ended up canceling the trip and moving until right now
 And so right now we're here with a bunch of the the the donors from Punahaki live and they all had a chance for last
 Today's to see their actual school like I'm looking at right now
 If you've been following me on Instagram or Facebook, you've probably seen videos and pictures of it
 But it's beautiful and so we got to dedicate the school yesterday with a big celebration
 And it was cool, but
 Actually we step back. So I could tell you guys stories for hours, but I have to start packing in the next about five minutes
 So this will be a little shorty condensed, but there's a couple messages I wanted to share before I left
 This beautiful place and forgot so
 This time when we came in Kletna came in a day early
 Because now Jane we've been funding her to go to college
 And so she's actually in college now
 So we came today early to see her and so we had a chance to she came to our hotel and we met her and
 Just amazingly see see this progression in six years of this little girl who you know had nothing
 In this little village who's just getting the ability to learn for the first time because we built this school here
 and now six years later she's she's in college and
 And she got it she has she got a job as a model and she's doing this modeling thing
 We actually are helping her to fly to Germany to compete in modeling competition in Germany later on this year and
 She took us to her home
 But your home is probably 300 feet
 You know square feet maybe maybe 350 if you count the bathrooms and stuff
 Which the bathrooms literally you know a two foot by two foot room with a toilet and then there's a shower above the toilet
 It's crazy and she's so proud of it
 She wanted us to be proud of her
 She had her own little home and she you know cook cook her own food and then she took us to her school
 And showed us the only her principal and saw the classrooms and oh she's so cool to see her and how how she just wanted
 She just wanted us to be proud of her which we are and
 Such a such a cool experience. All right, let me fast-forward see the last three days here
 So we've been here in this community and we got to help paint the school and we got to help build these brick paths
 And you know these doing all these things manual labor, but the best part is the kids
 There's about 250 kids that now attend this school we built so we're playing with them
 We were wrestling with them. We were playing soccer with them. We were doing I taught them dogpile
 Which means I run and I bend over and all 250 or so jumped on my back at once
 Like I'm so sore today
 Anyway, but it's just been amazing experience and then yesterday they had this
 really cool
 Celebration where the government officials came in and the community came in about five or six hundred people were here and we got to dedicate the school
 and
 It was cool because they asked if clinton I would actually speak at a dedication
 And so we there was an interpreter there for us and we have stand up and and I told the story of why I'm here
 I told the story about a basically ten years ago stew mcclayered and Amy his wife
 Had a vision for this thing where they were gonna build schools in Kenya and he called me up and told me the vision and then
 You know six years ago
 So you brought me here and I told him how we fell in love with the Kenyan people and how then when we went back home
 We told our community the funnel hacking can click funnels community about about what was happening here and and for those you guys
 Don't know some you guys know this but every time you build the funnel inside click funnels and you set the funnel live
 We actually donated dollar towards world heat trade
 and
 So every time you're building click funnels you're actually helping build schools and I told him so there's tens of thousands of entrepreneurs every single day
 Are trying to grow their own companies and when they do that they are investing here in this community because they love you guys as well
 And just for example last you know last year alone a funnel
 I came out of a world or excuse me used to be called the world heat trade they changed the name to village impact
 But we gave village impact to check for over a hundred and I think 120 or 130 thousand dollars
 And that comes from all of you guys building funnels
 And so we gave them you know gave told about that and I said and you know and there's some donors who
 who wanted to to
 Who loved you guys so much they wanted to come and they know and just into the donors who who came and
 Anyway, just really special special moment, but this will share
 Actually two more things I want to share
 So the first one was as I'm sitting there during the ceremony
 I'm thinking about there's two charities as you guys know that I
 Participate in that I believe in and one is operation underground railroad, which is the
 the charity that we've been working with that saves children from human trafficking from sex slavery and in the other one is
 Village impact which helps to build schools and educate children in these third world countries
 And I've seen everything like how do I like how do things tie together?
 like I'm drawn to both of them so strongly how do they how do these things fit together and
 And also the the two words that came in my mind were liberation and education
 I sure think and that's what we're doing like we're liberating children and then we're educating children
 I thought what greater mission in the world is there then to liberate children from from evil people and then to educate children
 So they can they can change the world they can change their world as they grow up. It's got me excited. I think that
 Moving forward that's gonna be a lot a big part of my
 my you know from the philanthropy or charity or whatever we call it side of me and my business is that that mantra of
 Liberation and education with liberating and educate children because if you can liberate a child and give them a life
 And then you can educate a child so they can create their own life like what better what better?
 mission can we have on this earth and
 That and so anyway, I just want to show it with you
 Liberate and educate children. That's my my focus is moving forward and you'll see a lot more of that a funnel hacking live
 And moving from in fact, I'm already visiting t-shirt. This is liberating on one sleeve and and
 Educate on the other sleeve one with the OUR logo with the world to eat or the village impact logo and
 Maybe funnel hackers in the middle bridging the gap between these two these two vital important missions
 Oh, so excited anyway. All right, so one more sure I'm gonna tell you and then I will wrap it up for today
 Because I'm already over my time limit and they're probably gonna probably gonna miss the bus
 I don't know my roby if I don't hurry
 so
 After after the ceremony ended yesterday
 I was on voxer and I was kind of you know working on a really cool funnel
 He has a sea sand so I was kind of getting some feedback some people and as I'm doing that I look up
 And there's this man walking towards me. He's got a backpack on he's got a he's got a suit on
 he's uh, you know, he's 33 years old he's walking towards me and and look up and and I'm still doing my thing
 And I look a little closer and he's looking right at me and he's got kind of smile his face and I'm looking also like
 Oh my gosh, that's that's Leonard
 And so I put my phone down. I come around and give him a huge hug
 and um, so the back story on Leonard is
 Um as we were helping Jane in college
 Um about two and a half three years ago
 Uh, Jane, who I mentioned earlier
 Um, we asked Irene who's one of the main people here in kenjana ground that that that run the whole ability impact
 Uh mission
 Who says her clap had this um impression she's like is there is there another kid there's someone else?
 I'm just like we want to help one more person so one person we can help
 And are you said well actually there's this this uh this boy who um
 He's a hard worker. So he's right now. He's in the community's volunteer teaching for free
 he's got a wife and five kids and um
 and uh, he he was studying school to be a doctor like microbiology and things like that so that
 Um
 And so that basically he had uh
 He'd done two and a half years of of his schooling
 But he had to drop out because they had no more money to keep funding it now
 He's back in the village is volunteering and and working and trying to help serve the community
 And so that you know, he's a hard worker who got really high grades and would love to go back to school
 And so clap said yes and she can't do me today. There's just other kid
 We're gonna help and it's like $800 a semester for him to go to school and you know, he's got I can't remember five or six semesters left
 And so she's like I I sent the money for him to finish his schooling and so for us
 It's like what?
 2,500 bucks or you know 3,000 bucks or whatever was like just
 Not something we'd be thinking about like oh here you go and we just you know gave gave the money and
 and um
 Here's for this boy Leonard who's an amazing human five kids. Oh just such a cool guy
 So I see him again and he gives me a huge hug and he starts telling me the story from the very beginning
 He says okay
 He starts talking about what was happening and and uh, you know the village he was in how he got the government moved
 Mouse village and then he fought to get back into school and then he he worked all you know
 All year round race funds for school and he went to a semester and then he had worked for another year race funds
 He got another semester and and all these things and finally when when school got ripped away from him last time and he couldn't
 couldn't raise funds anymore and
 And um and they said that one day he was with his family and they were out in the field
 um
 getting um, you know
 Getting getting food for their family. He said he got this phone call from Irene
 He said that the phone call Irene said hey, I found um some some donors who want to sponsor you for school and um
 and
 And uh
 And they've already wired the money and it's an account and you can start school and he said he sat there and spilled with his kids
 Just crying that there's somebody on earth who cared enough about him and his family to do this
 He said he said I I told myself and I told my family that because somebody cared this much that I was not going to take it easy
 Or I'm not gonna I'm not gonna relax. I'm going to
 I'm gonna I'm gonna do my best and get the highest grades possible
 And so you went back to school and over the next two and a half years or so
 He uh, he got his degree
 He got honors. He was the top three out of his like out of all the class
 and he was the second or the third highest highest marks and um
 And uh, and what was crazy is he actually this yesterday morning had jumped in a motorcycle
 And driven for four hours to get here to see us and the streets here aren't like streets in america
 These are like roads with four-foot potholes like it's it's it's it's crazy. It's not an easy drive
 So four hours to get here to come and to tell me the story and then afterwards he opened his backpack and he pulled out his diploma
 And he wanted me to see his diploma. He was so proud of it
 and uh, we looked at his diploma and uh, clinton and i both gave him a hug. We were so proud of him and
 And uh, and then what he said that was so powerful
 He said he said every single night my wife and my five kids. We pray for you in america
 We pray for the people who cared enough about our family to help support us
 And it brought tears in my eyes to think in
 God like
 You think about
 everyday struggles we're dealing with like how how powerful to have
 Family or families on the other side of the world who are so clean and so pure and so
 um
 Such such good people who are praying for us to to survive and to thrive and to do good
 um
 Because we serve them and um, we literally changed
 Not just his life, but like he told us after he graduated he said he went back to the school
 Which one the school is the village impact of built
 He said I wore all my robes and made a huge celebration the government came out
 And I told all the kids that because I was successful because I got a degree
 All of you guys can get degrees and now there's an entire community of kids who believe they can get a degree because you believe that I could get a degree
 and um
 Is just such a special special special thing and so um
 I know this isn't like me teaching you a marketing secret or anything
 But I kind of indirectly am
 um
 I promise you guys as you start shifting your focus from
 yourselves
 To your customers. I think that's the first level
 Um, you will start seeing your your businesses grow what I mean by that is most entrepreneurs start
 To give them a selfish standpoint. I want to make money, which is not bad
 That's how that's that's what gives most of us enough desire to get through the pain that it takes to get one of these things running, right?
 Um, but the people who grow are the ones who very quickly shift from a me focused to like oh my gosh
 I'm serving these people and this is amazing and that becomes the focus of serving other people
 And I think the third the third tier after that
 Is when you start looking outside of just your customers like you'll cast out yourself
 Like I said your customer slot to like how can you have a greater impact on people who?
 Who they can't necessarily do anything for you
 other than pray for you, which is
 Which is amazing?
 And you know, I look at I look at my business. I look at
 I look at the blessings. I've that I I received daily and I think a big
 A huge piece of that is because i've been willing to
 um to give time and money to
 to people like this
 And now because I was willing to do that I have an army of people around the world who are praying for our success
 who are praying for my family or praying for my marriage who are praying for my business who are praying that I will continue to be
 um successful because
 I cared enough to try to change their world
 And so for you guys, I just want you guys to think about that as you're looking through your own personal evolution
 That you know initially it's you then it's your customers and then it's outside of that like how can you help?
 and um
 You know, I I was getting nervous sharing these kind of things because I don't
 I don't know
 You know, like bragging about my customers. I don't like bragging about like charity stuff
 And that's not the point of this the point though is hopefully to
 Inspire you guys to do to do more of it because I promise you have an army of people on the other side of the world
 praying for you is a powerful force
 And uh, and so again my my new my new mission after this trip
 is to liberate and to educate children and uh, and
 I will continue to have ways you guys can participate in that vision that mission if you feel like I do
 You know on the or you are side. We have or you are film.org you can go watch that and that'll help you learn how to
 How to liberate children and uh, we're gonna be putting out some really cool funnels
 On the education side with the world teach rate as well
 So you can and I'll announce some of those when we get home and you can see how to help
 on the education side as well
 But find a mission like that. You know stew
 Stu talked about this yesterday
 uh, nisa who
 Who came from our
 ClickFunnels community here to kenya as well. She talked about as well
 Um, you know a lot of us feel guilt internal subconscious guilt when we start making money
 That holds us back. I think when you start realizing that the more money you make the bigger impact you can have
 Um, that's when that's when you start getting free like she talked about he he had all these mental barriers
 Because he felt guilt like subconsciously felt guilty making money making money and he can never get past certain levels
 And he started shifting to helping other people realize man more money and make them more people I can help
 Then those subconscious beliefs disappeared and he was able to
 To grow his company to the levels he he wanted to and that he needed to
 I think the same thing's true for all of you guys as well. So anyway, I just want to show it to yesterday
 I'm looking at all these kids probably 100 kids are not watching me waiting for us to come play
 So I have to go finish packing my bags and then play at the kids and then we're
 And back tonight roby and then after that we're heading to safari for a couple days
 Um, which will be really neat as well, but nothing's as good as this first three days
 We get to play with the kids and be here in the village. So there you go guys. Appreciate you all. Thanks for listening
 Hopefully this um helps shape and help focus your vision
 Um because while it may not seem like anything to do the business says everything to the business
 Thanks so much for listening guys and we will talk to you soon. Bye
