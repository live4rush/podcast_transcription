 What's up everybody this is Russell and welcome to today's episode of marketing secrets is in the rain here in Kauai
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers
 My name is also Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody so I want to welcome you guys to today's episode marketing secrets is raining on me right now and
 If you can see that over here if you're watching the video version, but it's beautiful here, and I wanted to do an episode
 Oh, man, this is really good. I might come and
 Hide in the bush or something. Ah
 Anyway, I'm just gonna say here we go at it be more fun this way. All right, so
 We've been in Hawaii for almost a week now on my 15 year anniversary, which is amazing
 Being married to my beautiful wife Collette this long and I'm trying to get her to do an episode with you guys
 Hopefully on the flight home or something, but what it's like living with me married to an entrepreneur
 At our we're trying to pick our keynote speaker for
 This year's fun hacking live and it's funny because we got tons and tons of people voting for everybody
 And some of us at Oprah and some of them pick Russell's wife and my wife got more votes than Oprah
 Which is pretty exciting so try to get her at least to jump on the podcast
 That's the that's the goal in the game plan, but what I'm sure if you guys today has I been
 Where the why the rain's gone that fast oh, but there's
 There's a bird drive
 anyway, so
 My phone off real quick. All right, so what I wanted to share with you guys
 I've been listening to a whole bunch of cool marketing stuff between like the long drives around the island all kind of the cool stuff
 We're doing and the course I was listening to is TJ roll letter TJ if you're on TJ
 He's like one of the legends in our business
 He is the one of the direct male kings and he's in the biz-op world and he teaches me my friend
 I'm speaking one of our events a while ago
 Which was amazing and what's interesting is the course I was listening to is like how to become super rich in the opportunity market
 He's people how to make money in the like keeps people how to get rich market, but was interesting as I was listening to it
 If you read the expert secrets book and I talked about there's three core things
 Do you got to do to have build a mass movement right number one?
 number one you have to have
 The attractive character charismatic leader number two to have future based cause number three if you have a new opportunity
 What's interesting as I was listening to this he's talking about like how to sell opportunities like basically if you're doing a mass
 We were talking about like it's always a new opportunity like it's like everything he's talking about about the opportunities the way
 He kind of positions them right how to get rich how to make money how to make here's the opportunity market as he calls it
 But in my mind every market's the opportunity market
 So I'm gonna see if I can interview TJ and dig deep in that because stuff was brilliant
 It was all targeted towards selling people stuff. I had to make money how to make money
 but
 If you look at through the lens of expert secrets book then it kind of works for all of them right
 Because every single opportunity everything you're selling should be a new opportunity
 And it was anyway, so I'm gonna try to see if I can do that plus TJ
 So like this is he launched his company he lives out in Kansas and he actually bought a
 Hospital and renovated the whole thing and that's where he
 That's where he
 Runs the company have an old hospital which is kind of cool
 I kind of want to go down there to see his operation
 So it may come to an episode of funnel hacker TV soon where I go down there and tour his hospital and see his his whole organization
 The last ten years they sent out nine like ninety five hundred different direct mail campaigns
 Which is crazy?
 He says some people will get on his list and they make it between two and three hundred letters in the mail per year
 Depending on what sequence they take what offers to say yes to a note and all sorts of stuff. So
 anyway, super inspiring, but
 What I want to talk about is a couple of core things I learned from him. I think you're really good for all you guys in fact
 The first was actually not from TJ's it was from a bill glazer thing. I was listening to so bill was
 Partners with Dan Kennedy Glazer Kennedy and he was like my my marketing dad for and five or six years
 I was in this inner circle and one of the things that was cool as studying from bill this week bill is talking about how
 They have like the very beginning of the year. They know that they're big things right so they did two events here
 They did info summit and super conference for me
 I do for hacking lives like that's my big thing and they said that they
 Categorized all the promotions based on the importance and number one were there two events number two was this number three
 And then they had it all mapped out and then they mapped out the entire month
 Or excuse me the entire year the promotional schedule of getting a year to make sure they fill the events and all those
 Things kind of fit in there now
 Think about that like I don't know about you guys, but I'm not super good at mapping out my promotional calendar and schedule and things like that
 I
 Kind of just like go week by week month by month and do stuff and what bill does
 In this course again, this is an old course
 But he maps it out and then they do through everything and so I started thinking about this one of our inner circle meetings
 Justin Williams was talking about with his with his stuff now
 As you guys know if you've been listening to our podcast for any length of time
 You know the two magic things that marketers have or urgency and scarcity so he started in his is he really launched different courses
 Throughout the year and they'd open them and close them right so they have the urgency and scarcity close
 That's where most of the cells always come in is during the closing of the thing
 Also, if you listen to when Stu launched tribe he's talking about
 Michael Hyatt when they launched his membership site the big secret they had was like opening and closing so that twice a year
 They opened up membership site and there's clothes and sure thing about that man
 Like right now most of our programs are open all the time which is good
 But the urgency and scarcity is not there and so I was like I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start calendering it out
 We're twice a year. Our things are available. So twice a year people can buy see us can buy our certification program twice a year
 People can join funnel university twice a year. They can get fill your funnel twice you so like all of our core
 Offers are only open to twice during the year and they're closed down other than that
 Which is kind of fun because they'll have urgency and scarcity and build up the hype in the buzz
 And it gives me each month something to focus on like this month is funnel you month
 Okay, and we're gonna open it and close it the next month is this we're gonna open it and close it and all content all things
 Can be related back to that to that one thing so that was the first thing I kind of sort of rethinking through
 Whether listen to Bill Glaser talk about how they structured the promotion around their events. That was that's first cool thing now with TJ
 A couple cool things that he does that I think man was just good for me to hear again
 I think it's good for all you guys to hear again. So TJ again
 He's in the business opportunity market
 Mostly through direct mail and so he has 50,000 letters
 He mails every single week weekend week out just consistently
 They know 50,000 letters go out every single week all for new customer acquisition
 That's it new customer acquisition 50,000 letters every single week and that's just that's the schedule and I think for a lot of us we get in this thing where
 Like we have our friend and funnels, right break even phones were being people in them
 We have our monetization funnels
 I think a lot of us we create one really good webinar funnel
 It's saying then that becomes our focus and and that's it and we're driving traffic and and that's like the business right and TJ
 If you look at this again, he's got his friend and lead gen offers and he's knowing 50,000 pieces a week
 And he said it at his peak you sell him you was selling the $50 course from his friend and lead gen stuff
 He said he was spent up to $500 to sell $50 course and then from there
 They're going to all the back end funnels right and the back end things he he was selling
 But he had his consistency 50,000 pieces every single week and start thinking about that like man
 He's milling 50,000 new names every single week. Like what's the what's the equivalent that for my business? Okay?
 I
 Need to make sure that I have something consistently doing that every single week to one friend offer
 And he talked about one of the big things also is like he's not mailing two different things or three things that 50,000
 It's like they they have one offer the hottest converting one and that's the drive all their energy all their money all everything
 And so for us
 I think all of us we have our hot offer
 We need to be spending as much as we can to get people into that thing
 Consistently every single week just knowing I spent 50 grand a week or 10 grand a week or thousand bucks a week
 Whatever it is for you into that front end thing, right? If you break
 If you think about this if you break it down, there's there's kind of two sides of this there's
 or three sides if you depending on how deep you want to get with
 We talked about this this upcoming funnel hacking live, but there's a process
 There's basically kind of three types of funnels. There's acquisition funnels with getting people in there's ascension funnels
 Descending them up within your your your membership and then there's monetization funnels
 But for this argument for today, I'm just gonna talk about the two so there's acquisition funnels, right?
 So so what is your one acquisition funnel that you can consistently do X with right?
 So for me it might be I need to make sure I sell at least a thousand books a week or any is spend
 10 grand a week or whatever that thing is for you, right?
 And like you just know that and you get you have to do it
 Consistently we have still thousand books a week and that we should build a whole team people that entire goal sell thousand books a week or
 5,000 books or whatever that number is for you back on every call center. That's how was we had free plus shipping leads and
 We had to get I think was 8,000 leads a month to get enough leads for ourselves floor
 That became the focus of the business. Okay, and so for you think about TJ right like what is the front end offers consistently bringing people in
 Okay, and then from TJ like so crazy. I'm hoping I can go down there and film his operation for you guys
 I want to see it too
 But like I said, this is when gets the front end then he's got all these direct mail campaigns that go out
 Offering two-step things so he'll send out a letter for free CD about whatever to these existing customers
 Okay, so we only send it people that already that already bought his $50 thing
 They don't put him on to a sequence that says he gets free CD if they if they respond to the free CD
 Then he puts them in a sequence to sell the thing that free CD the upsell suit
 And then he puts them out the next offer and the next offer and he's putting out all these front end lead gen
 I guess it gets like their acquisition or monetization
 Letters to the buyers of his $50,000 week thing right?
 It's $50,000 a week every single bring new people in and after they come in
 They bought a $50 thing then he starts sending these letters trying to get them to raise their hand about specific opportunities
 He's gonna sell them and they if they respond to one of those then they go into a whole other sequence
 They might get 10 15 20 letters to sell like a two or three or $5,000 course on the back end
 And that's kind of this process that he does over and over and over and over again
 And so for me what I'm looking at is what I want my focus to be is somebody comes in
 To my world and again, I'm focusing way more effort consistently on this on this, you know
 I'm gonna call it the 50,000 letters a week
 But you know for us we're not doing direct mail right now
 So it's not that but you know that that's the concept the front and lead
 Acquisition and then if they come in then we're taking our core courses and we're opening them and closing them opening and closing them
 Opening and closing them throughout the year. So those are our monetization funnels after people come in and so that's kind of it's kind of the game
 And I'm really excited for it. So that's the game. I'm gonna be playing and I hope you guys
 Model model that
 Cool thing I'm gonna be doing. I'm thinking a lot about this for the last probably two weeks started scout campus
 and some my mind even here is we've been in this beach house is
 Is having like one really good follow up funnel sequence that takes people through my offers in a very strategic way
 So we have ignite ignite your funnel calm
 Which is right now we're using something completely different. Let me change that to where this is an opt-in form
 But we get people opt into and then it's going to take them through sequence where I haven't quite map holding out
 But first I want something to buy is what my business first
 I want someone to buy his expert secrets. I'm a big have a video me explaining why they need experts secrets
 And why it's a step in for one actually step me step back step in one's not gonna be the book
 Step number one is gonna be the podcast you just heard a little while ago
 The two episodes on your one funnel way I'm gonna show that video to build connection with people immediately after they opt in
 And then from there on film get the experts secrets book and then from there
 I said whether they need next know logically build out a really long sequence is gonna be this this
 Ascension funnel that takes them up through our core offers in the middle and
 Then the big thing that our team is gonna be focusing on is our KPI is how many opt-ins a day
 Are we getting inside of the night your funnel funnel?
 The night your funnel ascension funnel to send him through all of our offers, right?
 And I'm kind of think how this whole thing all works together
 It might be when someone opts in the very first time they go through a ascension funnel that all those offers will be
 open to them open and close like
 Like an evergreen format and then after then they'll bump over to monetization funnels or money
 You know like our our longer-term email sequences, which then they'll be on when we open and close them each each month
 Not positive yet on that still figuring out all the details just but it's fun to think through it, right?
 Anyway, so that's kind of game plan
 So those are some fun things I learned and thinking about while I've been here having some fun
 In Kauai on my 15 year anniversary. So I hope that gives you guys some ideas and some things to think about
 So kind of to recap the important things
 Number one is focusing on consistent
 Consistently bringing new blood into your business, okay
 50,000 letters a week rule which call that 50,000 letters a week rule
 Consistently bringing new blood in okay
 I'm Eric Garrett white last funnel hacking live talked about people can make it rain the rain makers are the ones who
 dominate this world in this business
 So you have to be focusing on making it rain if you want to learn how to make it rain right now the programs closed
 But depending on your listeners might be open is our failure funnel course
 And failure funnels all about how to make it rain how to get new customers into your funnels, right?
 That's number one
 Then number two is then after they come in then what's the monetization?
 So maybe number two is the ascension funnel which is for me
 You know not ignite your funnel takes them through our offers in a chronological order of where I want them to see things
 Opening and closing on like an evergreen format and then end that then put them into our
 monetization team monetization funnels which would then be
 Taking our core six offers and opening and closing them twice a year and
 That's gonna be the business
 Make it's really excited really really excited. So anyway, that's the game plan guys
 I'm glad I had a chance to talk to you guys is making it clear clear in my mind
 So I hope you guys got something to value that too, but like I said, I don't practice
 I don't just talk about this kind of stuff
 I practice what I preach so you'll see me implementing these things in the very near future and hopefully guys
 We'll see them and you'll enjoy them and you will model them and funnel hacking for it. You guys are doing because I know
 This stuff's gonna be amazing. So that's what I got you guys. Anyway, here's one last view. This is the
 Beach House we've been staying in it was an Airbnb. We're gonna hotel and we looked at
 Airbnb and we found this Airbnb or VRB our cameras one this thing it's like 5,000 square feet
