 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secret show. I'm so excited to have you guys here
 and this episode is gonna be a fun one so recently we started a new marketing secrets live show and
 This is a segment from the show that we actually are gonna be posting here on the podcast
 It's called it's titled how to remain humble or aka don't drink your own cool
 I'm gonna go through five things you can do to make sure your head doesn't get too big as you are
 As you are growing your company
 And so it's been kind of fun. I was that said I'm a cute thing song and we come back
 We will jump right into that segment from the show
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing secrets live show
 This is the first time we've done this live live live and I'm so excited
 We got a bunch of cool things where we talking about a lot of fun segments when we're going through with you guys today
 But to kind of kick this whole party off
 I wanted to go to a question that I've gotten from from you guys as a community
 We asked last week in the Facebook group and said hey if you have questions for us
 So please post them down below we got a whole bunch of amazing questions back
 And I wanted to pick one to answer because I thought it was I thought it was it had to be fun
 I thought it'd be timely and good for everybody here
 So the questions for the community that they came through that one answer says now that you run a company worth nearly a billion dollars
 Remember to say billion you have to do this thing with your pinky from Austin Powers
 I've was a 90s kid so now it comes worth nearly a billion dollars
 Do you have to make concert effort every time every day to remain humble or do the new challenges you face keep you humble?
 So I think that question was really really cool
 I wanted to address that one because I've been in this industry now for
 Man over 15 years and in that window of time
 I've seen a lot of people who have come made a bunch of money and then people who've crashed
 I've seen people who have gotten really big egos people you know and and all sorts of stuff and
 And I'm not gonna I've gone through a cycle as well myself
 I think there's times when you drink your own Kool-Aid and you think you're amazing and I wanted to address that because
 It's something that I'm actively always trying to work on and I think everyone should as well
 So I kind of refrained this question into something
 Like like how I would kind of rephrase it somebody so the question was like well
 How do you remain humble and then I wrote with my sub-headliner
 I wrote a K a don't drink your own Kool-Aid
 And I think one of the biggest problems and I remember this vividly like like 15 years ago when I got started
 Like I spent the first two years
 In my basement like grinding the thing out and it was lonely and everyone thought I was crazy and people made fun of me and like
 All those things right and and the students are on success
 I think part of you gets this especially as an entrepreneur especially like an athlete for me
 It's like you get this like like when you're having the success
 It's just like you want to kind of like prove to them that that they're wrong, right?
 And so I think my head started getting bigger. I thought like I was I thought I don't know
 I was drinking my own Kool-Aid or drinking my own bio and and
 Luckily for me a couple years later
 Multiple times now my company's crashed and burned and as painful as that that process was it helped me to understand some things
 So I wrote down basically five five things to help you remain humble that I would
 Say the five things that go through my head all the time is I'm trying to make sure that that I'm very careful on this on this
 Path I feel like you know for any of us if we're not careful
 If we if our heads get too big if we stop being humble like all these things
 We're trying to do can be taken away from us and I I very much believe that to be true
 Just because of my cycle of every time that my head gets too big. I seem to get humbled and so
 These are the five points at number one
 I want everyone to understand is that when you take on something like this that you are called to serve an audience, right?
 It's not about you making money like that's how we keep scores
 I how much money my business makes I hit two comma club my man to comma club X like like we're always looking at those those benchmarks to
 To have something
 That we can we can track our results on but that's not why we're in this game
 Like we are called to serve somebody right like any of you entrepreneurs who are here today
 You like you've had that calling you're like oh my gosh like I'm here to serve this type of person or this person
 Or this was me five years ago. I figured out how to solve this problem. I'm here
 I'm called to serve that that per that that audience right so first the understanding is that you're not here is like look
 How great I am it's your you it's literally for me
 I believe that entrepreneurship is a calling and and this calling that you've been called to serve this group of people when you think about it
 That way it's different. It's not about you it shifts the focus like look how great
 I am to like how can I help these people and how can I put them up on a pedestal if you look at
 Special of last three or four years, you know the marking that we do if you notice like it's less and less ever about like look
 How great Russell is because first off that's annoying and second off nobody cares instead
 I want to take the people that are having success to our community
 I put them up on a pedestal. I've been called to serve them. I've not been called to serve myself
 Right, so that's the first thing I understand is that you have been called to serve
 Number two you have to realize that it is not you okay
 I think sometimes we get this great idea right. I'm a genius and it's like that that may be like I
 Don't know. I don't personally believe that I don't think like we just I don't think that the idea is us the idea comes to us
 Right like we're blessed with these ideas we're blessed with inspiration
 We're blessed with like like seeing the vision of where we need to go and those things are are
 They're not us they're given to us and you have to realize that that it's not it's not you so it's not you making this greatness
 It's you because you're you're following a path and you're doing the right things that you are given these insights these ideas these these things
 So it's not you and so the more you think that all this is me the less those those ideas those inspirations will come to you
 So it's a very fine line where your head starts getting big
 Those things will will become less and then things start shrinking for you and the more you realize that it's not you
 That you're just there receiving these ideas receiving inspiration
 Then it gives you the ability to be able to continue to get those things that's number two
 Number one you're called to serve number two realize that it is not you number three
 All this stuff that you are creating can be taken away at any second
 I can literally wake up tonight and get a text from somebody like hey Russell ClickFunnels is gone
 And the many thing no way or else are you too big? It's like no I see that happen all the time
 Different companies to be a government agency comes to check you down could be your servers crash
 You're like there could be a million things that could happen
 Some of you remember a ClickFunnels story like we were a year year and a half into ClickFunnels
 And I was flying to London to go speak at this event and when I landed the plane
 I got off and initially didn't have internet because I did like get a
 International chip my phone I plugged one in since I did my phones blowing up and ClickFunnels servers were down
 We were down for like seven or eight hours
 We were like on the brink of losing ClickFunnels the whole entire thing four years ago like when we first started this whole journey
 We almost lost the entire thing and we would have lost the company because of a database issue that happened now since then
 We've gone insane and hired insane amounts of people and infrastructure stuff to make sure that stuff doesn't happen again
 But it could happen for any of us right any of our businesses we can lose it and so it's understanding like this can be taken away at any
 given time
 It could be you know a million different things
 I've had close friends in the last couple months that have passed away from from health issues that was taken away from there's there's
 Government interactions. There's there's server. There's a million different things and so if you think it's all you I
 Think a lot of times that's when we get humbled. I've had multiple times my company has crashed and I realized you know
 You know prior to that I think I'm a genius like how great it is and when it's taken away
 It's like wow it really wasn't me
 There's so many other things that we need to be grateful for that are happening that keep us
 They keep this moving so that's number three. It can be taken away
 Number four is that none of this stuff really matters what all said done like it doesn't matter as much fun as entrepreneurship
 Business business is always kind of things like it doesn't really matter last night's with my kids
 They had a wrestling match and remember going there and watching it and both my kids did awesome
 We both won their matches down and had he was wrestling the the kid who was the district champ last year down out there
 And one we're going crazy. We're screaming and I was like I sit in there
 I'm like this is what matters like me some time my kids my family. That's what matters. It's not this you know
 I I've I'm on Instagram. I think two or three times the last month. I've made posts where I'm just like like
 Business is what you do while you wait for your kids to get out of school business
 What you do while you're waiting for your wife to come home like like this is kind of the thing to keep us occupied have some fun
 Hopefully serve some people but like when all comes down to the thing it really matters is our families
 And so I think when you realize that then none of this stuff really matters that much
 It gives you different perspective and number five and this is one that's really hard is don't pay attention to the fans
 I
 Think sometimes as you start growing people are like start talking how great you are and you'd be very very careful
 it's like
 What are the mermaids the sirens like the sirens who are in the water and they're seeing this beautiful music right and you get closer and
 Closer and then they come and they eat you and they destroy you
 We were anyway, that's a long story. I tell my kids about that and we were in the swimming pool
 And I was like scaring them and it was really funny, but that's another story from the day
 Be it to be careful like like the the fans the people who you're serving
 We'll look at you as if you're something great something special and they will tell you that over and over and over again
 And as much as I love hearing it
 I have to like listen to it and I have to like I have to like put it on the shelf you can't
 If you if you do that you keep if you keep listening to what the fans are saying
 It becomes very very hard and it's funny. I'm Sean Stevenson who's a close friend
 He passed away a little while ago
 I remember we were joking one time we're hanging out and we're joking about our wives and like we love our wives and
 Said one of the the things about our wives is like our wives aren't fans
 He's like they they fell in love with us and they love us, but they're not our fans
 It says it's nice because you come home and you feel like you're all awesome
 Then there's your your wife who loves you, but she's not a fan and she's just like hey
 And it changed like it instantly changes this whole thing and I'm so grateful for for a wife who's not a super fan
 Who's who's realistic? He's just like this is what it is and so I think that it's important for all of us to have people
 In our lives around us who aren't fans who are like the people who love us
 Because it helps take the ego off and let you focus on what's actually important
 So how to remain humble those are the five things number one you are called to serve number two realize it is
 Not you number three you can be taken away number four number really matters number five
 Do not pay attention to fans if you do that as you are growing and you're serving your change people's lives
 It'll help you to focus on
 On that and not not get ahead this too big. All right. Hope that helps
