 Good morning everybody. This is Russell Brunson with the marketing seekers podcast today. I want to talk about who gets a
 vote in their opinion about you
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, everybody so there's this weird thing us humans have
 Where we care what other people think I know I know it's what gives us empathy and makes us actually good people most of the time
 But in business it can cripple you in fact
 It does for so many of you guys I watch as you start an advertising campaign and somebody in your ad says
 You suck and you're like well
 You crumble and you start crying and the whole thing falls apart
 You start burning the ads because I'm told you that you're lame or that your ad was funny or that you're goofy or whatever
 And you freak out you stop moving forward and the whole thing collapses because you
 Carried about somebody else's opinion about you so
 I want to help you on this journey to stop caring about everybody except for one type of person
 there's only one person who has earned the right to have an opinion about you and
 That is the person who has given you money. That's it
 That's the only opinion that you should care about is the opinion of the person who gives you money
 And this is in so many different aspects of business right?
 for example when I first started speaking and I
 Even to this day. I'm not like the best speaker you guys probably notice that like I get excited
 It's like all these are good speakers. He's excited, but no I stutter I say um's and ah's and crap and all these things
 And like if you look it if I was to go to like the NSA the National Speakers Association and get judged
 They would destroy me. It would be horrible. So when I first started in events
 I was like after the event I had had at least a little papers to everybody
 I was like hey, can you give me some feedback on the speakers and guess what people gave me their freakin opinions and guess what?
 Their opinions like I'm a reading and being destroyed like oh
 This person thought I was horrible and like they were so mean about all these different things and
 I remember taking it really internally for a long time like it's trusting about it and freaking out about it until
 One day I was listening to good old mean Dan Kennedy and Dan said something that was so liberating to me that I need to share with you
 He said the only people's opinion I care about are the people who give me money and
 He talked about speaking from stage is that I used to be singing they would at the end of my presentation
 Everyone thought a form to to critique me said that they hand me the big stack of forms
 I would immediately walk over to the guard down to throw them away without reading any of them
 So the only thing that matters to me
 Whether I did a good at my speech or not as how many people line up at the back of the room to give me money
 That is the judge of how well you're you did that's it okay when you're running ads
 It's not how many people write nasty comments in the things all the haters and the trolls and the annoying people like that
 It's how many people actually gave you money how many people?
 Did your ad your persuasive your presentation your your funnel whatever
 Did it convince to keep people money like that's something that matters
 The worst things I see people do all the time is like and I understand it because you know
 That's fun people like that
 But like we all want people to critique our funnels before they're done and so
 I'll see all time in our Facebook group another place was like hey
 Can you you come and can she got to shoot my funnel and people give me all sorts of advice and I'm reading the advice
 I'm like I like don't
 Don't take advice from people like people are like they lie they don't know they're lying
 But they're lying they're gonna give you advice like oh you should do this you should do this you should change this like
 I don't know if the only opinion that matters is that people are voting with their credit cards
 That should be the only thing that matters like if they pull a credit card out of the wall to buy something
 That is the pinion that's the only split test
 I'm gonna look at not like people's opinions because people's opinions are wrong
 They're not entitled to own opinion when it comes to marketing itself
 okay the pinion in the marketplace is the only thing that matters and it's how people vote with their with their wallet and
 So I wanted I wanted to show you guys just because I know so many guys get crippled by that fear
 that of what other people think and
 You should stop the only thing you care about are the people who are that's the only pin you should care about
 The pinion of the people who are actually giving money because they're the ones that matter right?
 So I'm gonna hate your ad they don't buy your thing like they they talk trash on your webinar because like oh
 I've already heard this five times before like when you're gonna get to the good stuff like you stop telling me your story
 I don't want to know the one secret about blah like those people are not giving you money
 Therefore you should not care about their pinion the ones you care about are the people who hear your voice
 And they come to you and they're looking for a change in their life
 Those are the ones you should care about those who give you money now people give me money and they give me feedback
 Then I pay attention with something like him and your coaching program this part is confusing to me around stuck here
 I don't want to do like I listen those opinions
 I try to figure out how to serve them better, but don't focus on how to serve the people who aren't voting with their credit cards
 They're their vote is invalid in my mind and it should be in years as well because
 They are not your customers. The customer is the only thing that actually matters
 So I hope that gets some you guys freedom and permission to just be like
 Thank heavens
 Because that's the they're the ones entitled to heaven to vote
 So all the rest of the haters and the annoying people and all kind of things tune them out ignore them
 They do not matter to you and they shouldn't
 Yeah, so hopefully up somebody anyway, I just dropped the kids off school
 We have today and tomorrow's last days of school and it's officially summer ah, I'm not sure I'm ready for this
 Yeah, but it's happening. So I just remember last weekend by the end of the weekend
 I was so tired I was ready for the kids go back to school and then now there's like this three month long summer or weekend coming up
 So hopefully we can survive it. Oh man. It's gonna be awesome and this weekend. I'm actually driving to Utah
 For I'm in the finalists of an entrepreneur of the year award
 So we kind of fun to see if I have a chance to win that which would be cool
 And I'm driving to my wife my kids and I'm down
 So maybe just maybe if I can do it my goal is to catch my wife on a podcast during the drive to Utah
 So many of you guys have been asking for the podcast where Collette shares her thoughts on being married to a crazy entrepreneur
 So I'm gonna try for all you guys. It's not gonna be easy. She doesn't enjoy it. She doesn't like it
 She's comfortable doing it
 But see if I can get her to share because some of you guys want to know so
 That's a lot got you guys. I appreciate you all have an amazing day and don't forget
 The only person who should matter are the people who are voting with their wallets
 Okay, your opinion doesn't matter other people's opinions don't matter only matters are your customers
