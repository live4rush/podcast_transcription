 Hey everybody, it's Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing series podcast today
 I'm gonna be talking about a funnel called the invisible funnel and guess what it's back
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital?
 We're spending money from our own pockets. How do we mark it in a way?
 But let's us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain
 profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so if you read the original dot-com secrets one of the funnels I talked about was a funnel called the invisible funnel and
 It's interesting because I had used an invisible funnel for a long time
 And then we wrote the book
 I put it as a section inside the dot-com secrets book and then the book launch click funnel launch everything's been crazy
 Last five or six years and I have not done an invisible funnel since then and because I hadn't done one since then
 Nobody else did one. I haven't seen invisible funnel for five years
 And even though it's an amazing strategy I talked about in the book
 I showed the strategies and so when I was doing the new version of the dot-com secrets book
 I was like, it's a really cool thing, but people don't use it so must not be that that valuable
 So I'm just gonna I'm just gonna write it out of history
 So the new version of the dot-com secrets book does not talk about the invisible funnel
 and
 anyway, so so fast board and
 Actually, let me let me not fast for me. Rewind so let me tell you first where the visible funnel came from
 I'll tell you what it is. I'll tell you how we're using it right now
 so the invisible funnel came from my buddy Dagan Smith so what happened was Dagan and I were actually at a traffic and
 Conversion event and we were hanging out at lunchtime. We're eating much food and we had a good time
 And then we got done we both got up and we went inside the event room. We sat down we start talking and then
 And then he leaned over to me or I lean I came or leaned and said like hey man next to pain
 I'm like I didn't pay he's like I didn't pay the right oh crap
 So like we both jump up and we run out right oh we had to pay like we're so sorry
 we didn't need to ditch you like here's the money here's money for the food and
 You know back in the room and sat through the rest of it and for me
 I just like didn't think much about it
 But Dagan is a genius and then will's his head start spinning start spinning. He's like man
 He's like do you see what happened that law of reciprocity like we got this mill is amazing so much
 So that even though we technically would have had to pay because we got away with it
 You know not knowing he's like I had the rest process was so strong like I needed
 I needed like right then to go back and make sure the person's paid
 So he started the wheel started spinning his head
 He's like what if we did a webinar that way where another webinar like a class or course or whatever where instead of
 Instead of charging some up front. He said hey come come to the webinar
 Experience it then after it's over if you like it pay me if not then don't worry about it
 And that was kind of the initial brainchild of the invisible funnel was a funnel. It was basically backwards like that
 So he he kind of pioneered I did the first version where he basically had a funnel
 It was like hey $0 you get a credit card and just like reserve your spot come and tend the whole thing
 And if you if you love it don't do anything and after the webinars over
 All I'll bill you a hundred bucks, but if you think at the end of your I got it's not for me
 Let me know and I'll and I'll give you money back
 All right, you know
 I won't bill your credit cards didn't cost you anything
 And so he's he did the first version of that invisible funnel and he did it and it was it killed for him
 So remember I saw it and I watched what people do I was like that's genius. So I the next day as I dig in
 I'm gonna do one of those he's like it's called the invisible funnel. I'm like all that name is so good
 So I was like I'm doing invisible funnel and so we went and created one and that same kind of thing it was crazy is
 For me like if you look at a typical webinar
 Let's say I get a thousand people to register. I might get 300 to show up right 30% show a break
 If I did a paid web like a paid product it sometimes 30 bucks or 50 bucks for a course
 I may have sold maybe I'd sell a hundred of them right?
 This is back this is back then and so that's kind of my my thing if I do a free webinar
 I'll get 30% show up right if I do a paid like like I think it was 47 bucks
 It paid $47 webinar maybe I'll sell hundred to my list
 I guess probably like if I push hard I might get a hundred sales so I did it
 But I did a little flip right so it was a webinar and it was supposed to be a four-hour training for our deep dive on this one topic
 And it's free up for it
 You got to put a credit card in to reserve your spot and experience whole thing at the end of it if you decide
 You know at the end of it
 I'll give you an email address if you don't love it
 Let me know you can email me and we'll give you your money back free
 But if you do love it do nothing and then two days later whatever will bill you the 50 bucks
 So we launched it and I remember the exact numbers by feel like when I did that I sold like 300 people signed up
 And I was like wait what that's crazy 300 people so three times more than I would have sold if I just sold it as a product
 Based on kind of my my estimates what I thought I was gonna do then I did the webinar was crazy
 It's like in like an 85 or 90 percent show up rate
 He's gonna show up because they they were paying for like they wanted to make sure and then you know
 And I had some people that they told me that I could think I signed up just to like prove you wrong
 And like I sat through four hours, but I was like man
 I'll see you were my money like you definitely build me
 When all of a sudden I think we had that 10% of people 10% people who cancel and ask for their money back
 So it wasn't a little bit a little bit there
 But but even with 10% canceling it means 90% of people we actually build right
 Which is still way more than you know the hundred people I would have had
 Had I sold it up front and so that was the thing and we me and Dagan
 Tested a whole bunch of variations and variables on that different things one of the things we tested was
 It's basically you sign up for zero dollars and you pay afterwards or if you want to pre-pay you get a discount
 We tested that it was like 50% of people took the prepaid to save money and I was like that's crazy money at front too
 Anyway, we did all these different tests eventually we Dagan I actually did a two or three day long event in DC
 With the group about a hundred really amazing marketers and we taught this concept and it was really really cool and then
 Fast forward, you know the year later a cluiting.com
 Seeker's book and then it disappeared off the place of the earth and so
 Anyway as we were planning that to do this new to comic club
 Live events me as a scene if you go to to comic club live.com. So spell out T. W. Oh
 C. Oh MMA CLU B
 L. I. V. E. Dot com to comic club live dot com as right now
 We're in the middle of it and we were kind of preparing this I was like just the thought my head came and I was like
 What if we what if we went invisible funnel on this most people in my team like what's that mean?
 I'm like and a couple people knew from back in the day that I we haven't done that forever
 I'm like I know like we should totally invisible funnel this thing and so that was the concept and so that's what we've been doing
 So for the last two weeks now even promoting this basically you come to
 Do comic live.com to comic club live dot com you put your credit card in we don't believe anything and we're doing a three-day live event
 I'm going live for three days intense like it's gonna be really fun
 And then after the minutes over if you love it you pay $197 and that's kind of works
 and if and then there was a pre-pay where you can say $50 and get it for
 $147
 If you prepaid plus you got replaced for like five days at the end or something like that
 Where's you don't get replays if you if you do the the other way and so that's kind of what we did
 And that's how we structured it and right now it has been killing it
 We are over 2,000 sales so far. It's like 60% of people are taking the pre-pay
 Which is amazing because now we can spend tons of money on to buy ads and get people in and we still have another week
 About a week left before the event actually starts so my goal is probably into three three to 4,000 people
 Register which is amazing and we'll do the presentation and it's gonna be really really fun
 So that's what's happening and I just wanted to know the invisible funnel is back if you haven't done one
 That's the structure
 That's the concept is how it works if you want to see me talk about it in the original.com secrets
 But you got to find one of the old ones which I don't even know where you get those anymore
 Maybe Amazon or borrow your buddy's book if he's got one of the originals
 But that's kind of the concept of what the invisible funnel is and how it works
 And it's pretty powerful. So I'm excited to see the stats afterwards
 You know to see if it's if it's like back in the day when we're tempted to people cancel
 Maybe it's less now especially as I'm doing a three-day event as opposed like a three or four hour long webinar
 But it's it's pretty cool. So anyway
 I just wanted to kind of give you guys that as an idea another selling tool another type of funnel
 You can test a way to to get paid up front to create something
 A way to give a massive good will to your audience and reciprocity
 When they you have a chance to serve them and then they get to tell you at the end if it was good
 I can you imagine going to a movie and I'd be like I'm gonna go watch the movie and then after it's done
 I'll you know if it's good and if I like it, I'll pay you you know or going to restaurant like I'm gonna eat all the food
 If it's good, then I'll pay you if not I'm not gonna worry about it
 I that's literally what you're doing to your customers
 You're giving them this opportunity to come in like into like have a meal on me
 And if you love it then pay me if not like don't worry about it
 I don't really care and imagine the reciprocity that builds with you and your audience
 And for some people they're gonna take advantage of it for sure
 But the majority of people are good humans and they're gonna love it and it's gonna give you the ability to serve them
 They may have said no ahead of time
 Maybe like for my people they might not have spent 200 dollars on a ticket to a virtual conference, right?
 But now because they just set this other direction they're saying i'm gonna test it out
 Let's just try it
 See if Russell's as cool as he thinks and because the barriers lower they come in and then they can experience it
 So anyway, that's what we're doing and if you want to see one in action go to to commaclublive.com
 It'll be up for the next couple days before the event starts and um you can you can see how it looks like there
 So that's why I want to share with you guys the invisible funnel is back
