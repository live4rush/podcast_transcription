 What's up everybody all right welcome to day number four of four of the funnel I can I recap?
 Man, it's like as I'm going through this again reliving all the moments
 It's just like I'm putting myself in the room and the experiences and the feelings and the excitement and the energy and the
 I miss it like it's it's crazy. So those guys who are there you know that you experienced it and I
 Hope you guys come back in next year. So we can serve you again. It's crazy. I had some people come to me like
 Tell me like I've been to so many funnel hacking lives and so many other events like this was by far not just the best
 Funnocking live with the best event period. I've ever been to
 Which meant a lot and I even had
 It's interesting because one of the one of the early early Brian Bowman with early members in our community
 He voxed me. So you know it's interesting. It's like I've been in your community a long time
 And you know we were coming to the events and there's 600 people in the thousand and he's a lot of times as things get bigger
 He's like the the people they've been around a long time get kind of pushed down
 He's like just kind of you know they miss that special thing. He's like I don't know how you did it
 He's like even with forty five hundred people there. He's like we all still felt special like it's still still for people
 Been around a long time. It was still amazing. It was it was the best one yet
 And so that meant a lot to me and so we try to anyway, we try to keep it cool
 It's interesting because you know my vision for liking live
 Before going to the 10x event was like we should have 35,000 people in the stadium and now that we've now that I've done that
 And it was a lot as intimate as harder to connect and communicate
 We decided to keep it smaller and so as I told you before we're returning
 We're going back to Nashville next year in the same room same ballroom same stage. I want people to
 I told people that after the two comma club my presentation like this is the same stage
 I mean like the literal stage will be standing on next year if you get to come with a reward like look at that
 like and like this is this is your spot and so
 That was kind of that was kind of cool, but I'm one of the same spots
 So that means it's like I think we get I think five thousands like the fire marshal limit in the rooms
 We could have an extra 500 people from this year, but not much more and so we sold out every year in the past
 We'll sell it again this year. You know, we are
 Less than a year away from it already
 So if you don't have your ticket should I highly recommend go just go to funlhackingline.com and go and get them prices
 We'll be raising soon other stuff will be happening, but I would get your ticket now
 I'll make that commitment right now while you're like remembering what it was like to be there or while you're
 You know going through these recaps and like and realizing you missed it like make that commitment now to go and do it
 I'll get your ticket funlhackingline.com. All right, that said we keep the theme song and I'm gonna talk you guys through
 What happened today number four?
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet
 Still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so day number four
 This is the day where I like my stress starts going down my stress is the biggest because
 Obviously I love getting the presentation so much fun
 But the stressful ones like when I sell right and we we only sell two things for like you live number one
 Well, we sold the Travis secret software we sold it for free. So that was fun
 And then we have the donation for charities
 There's a charity then we're trying to get people to upgrade action XMD
 So it's just you know and half the room already has us they I get this stuff for free anyway
 And then the other one is the coaching program. So
 You know, it's interesting. I used to go to events back in the day where every speaker would sell something you got 50 pitches
 And the 10 X like every speaker sold something such as like that. We're here
 It's like you're really only one real sell all the other ones are just like
 They're little but the real sell is this coaching program and it's like something I believe so much in I've spent so much time and energy and money to make it amazing
 It's like I think I get nervous because I'm like I know that people go through this they're gonna be successful
 but how do I convince them of that right and
 And so I try to do everything my power to like give a presentation and make an offer that's so irresistible that that people will take me up on it
 And it's interesting like I did this whole
 Part of my presentation during the secrets of the two comic Club presentation that did yesterday
 I talked about the difference between
 Being resourceful and having resources and I told a story of Kenneth Cole and I may have told you as a story before but it's worth repeating
 But Kenneth Cole he has no Kenneth Cole to shoe company, right?
 When he was starting a shoe company, I think he was in New York and there was a big shoe show happening shoe show
 They say shoe trade show was happening
 So he went to go get a booth and they told the cost of booth and he couldn't afford it and most people would have stopped right there
 Okay, and this is the lesson for you guys only understand most people would stop right there
 But Kenneth Cole said I don't have the resources. I need to be resourceful
 So we said well, how about instead of instead of buying a booth?
 What if I ran into truck and put out in front of the the venue and I have all my shoes in there and then everyone
 will see it as a coming through
 He's like that's a good idea
 So he goes ran a truck like a big huge truck and the truck people like well, you know
 You park it there like it's like why not like we have to permit to park a truck in front of a
 Big building for you know for a for during a convention. He's like, oh again
 Most people to stop there right like I don't have the resources to get a permit but instead
 He's like well, how do I do that?
 So he ran over to the to the you know the state whatever the government said hey
 I need to get a permit to park my van in front of the shoe show and
 shoe shows attend twister anyway, and and
 They're like dude, we're not giving you a permit and I went out. It's like only two people get a permit first person is
 is you know construction if you're building something you get a permit or second is if you're making a movie and
 and
 And again most people are like, okay, I guess you know, I'm not building something. I don't make a movie
 I'm done, but can't coal again
 It's even other resources so he had to be resourceful so he went back and he he went to the city filed a
 business license he called his company named Kenneth Cole Productions went across the stores and kinkos or wherever FedEx
 Kinkos and got business cards printed said Kenneth Cole Productions walked back to the place where he gets the permit
 Said hey, my name is Kenneth Cole. I'm filing a permit
 I'm making a movie called the making of a shoe and I need this
 I need a permit for my it for my truck and they granted in the permit he got the truck parked the truck in front of the shoe show
 Didn't have money for actual video cameras
 Yeah, a bunch of people with cameras with no tape in it walking around filming it pretend filming him and had the big thing
 like we're making a movie called the the the birth of a shoe company and
 Every single person who went to the shoe show that with that weekend and the trade show walk past his truck out front
 And that's how he built his huge company, which is a huge company this day
 And in fact to this day his company still called pen and Kenneth Cole Productions
 And he said the reason why because it's a tribute to his belief in or his ability to focus on
 resourceful as opposed to having resources and so I
 Understand like higher your sign for coaching program. It's I don't have the resource that I have the money
 Yet I try to like how do I break that belief because I didn't have money when doing my coaching programs most people don't but like
 It's also the reason why I had success because you know the money so I I went into debt and I had this pressure had these things
 I had to like figure things out like it forced me to do things and so
 I told the stories in a way to break false beliefs and a lot of people that breaks false beliefs
 But some people again for some reason they don't listen they don't hear with the right ears and they don't sign up
 Like my mind I'm like like at the forty five hundred people we should have had four thousand that join the program
 I just makes logical sense like why wouldn't you at this point?
 But obviously that doesn't happen ever right?
 And so that's kind of that's that's kind of why I stress out over the day three so day to four like I have less stress
 Like I've done my my sales pitch is done people that are in or in and I kind of relax
 so we moved into Saturday and what's interesting is Saturday starts happening and
 The very first person to speak is Garrett white and the presentation is gonna be called the gap
 Right like there's a gap to where you are when you don't want to go and like how do you fill that up?
 And he started doing his presentation and in true. Gareaway fashion. He is so intense like I love him and he swears a lot and you know
 I don't swear I'm not a big fan of swearing, but I believe in him. I leave his mission
 I think he does it with with the pure heart even if it works out here if that makes sense
 Anyway, so it's funny cuz my mom was there and she's like I like mom do not come to the session
 Whatever you do and I don't want everyone like if if you're offended by the F word, please don't come because
 Yeah, in fact, I even tried to bribe Garrett
 I told him I wear a custom suit his next event if he didn't stop the the F word and he lasted like a minute 30
 And he's like fine, so you can wear shorts if you want I can't I cannot swear
 He does the presentation and half through the presentation this kid comes up
 And Andy and Andy comes up and it's just like I need to talk to everyone or something
 I don't know the whole situation and Garrett, you know could have his shit
 Like I said back down to say he's like he's like took this moment like okay brings this kid up, right?
 You can tell the kids in pain you can tell that he is not happy where he's at he wants to he wants to grow wants to do
 Whatever, but in his mind. He's saying I don't have the resources to do this thing
 So Garrett brings him on stage and hasn't done do burpees and pushups and I don't even know what he's doing
 I'm trying to break this guy's state. I think it tried it anyway. I'm sure there's that there's a purpose behind it all
 And then he basically
 Asked him flat out like it's like okay. What's your goal and guys the goal is to calm and come on stage next year
 He's like cool. Do you just have the coaching program like no?
 He's like that's not your goal. It's a fantasy like you're dreaming about but you don't want to put in the effort guys
 Like well, I don't have I don't have the resources. I don't have the money to do it and
 Garrett laughing you know 10 years ago in room just like this and and
 He's like I couldn't do it either like my wife is gonna leave me if I did it
 He's like but I knew I had to because these guys had given me a window. I believed in myself
 And so I I had to be resourceful and I figured it out
 He's like it changed everything for me and and Garrett kind of going through the story kind of pushing him a little bit
 You know like if you're if you're honestly kid like you think you need my commitment if the commitments know like you know
 I'm not gonna do it then
 Then then that's fine. If you say my commitments, I'm gonna commit to myself
 I'm gonna be on stage in two comic award means the next one much gonna make a million bucks
 So if you know you're making if you are committing yourself make that your goal and you're making a million bucks next one
 12 months what's 25 hundred bucks a month for coaching program?
 It's nothing so you honestly if you believe in yourself if you committed to yourself this this commitment
 Then you should go do it and it's funny cuz I I didn't tell Garrett self or he wasn't planning on selling for me
 I had nothing you know
 He doesn't get a penny for it
 But he's helping this guy through this decision which which is in proxy of everyone else sitting here
 It's thinking like if you honestly believe in yourself and you honestly believe in it
 This doesn't cost you any money ever right only caution money if you don't believe in yourself
 Like I'm not actually gonna do I'm gonna you know, I'm gonna say I'm gonna do it
 I'm gonna it's a fantasy minute
 I know I'm not gonna put the work and I know I'm not gonna do what it takes to make it successful
 Then he has a lot of money, but if you do
 You know
 $25,000 out of a million is not a lot of money
 But it is if if you don't believe in yourself
 If you're not actually committing and coveting to do that thing
 And so Garrett kind of just pushed him a little bit finally the kid makes this commitment, you know
 And I say kiddies 25 years old he said said all right
 I'm gonna do it and he marches to the back and he signs up and
 and
 Anyways interesting and then does rest get his rest of presentation and he ends up getting like 80 people come on stage and Garrett
 closes 80 more people on the coaching
 Based on the same concept just like like look you guys if you honestly we're gonna do this like you have like don't make this a fantasy
 I can make it a real thing and
 Anyway, it was it was amazing and then after and I'm gonna come back to that well
 yes, it's interesting because
 There are a lot of people who were like freaking out for this this guy, right and
 for Andy and like and we got people in social media who are like blowing up like what's happening for like live like they're
 hard selling people and it was weird
 I didn't know what to believe that in fact for last week. I've been like contemplating like
 It's been interesting and I've watched him last week is Andy is as because he made that commitment like he launches first funnel
 Yesterday like literally within seven days of my life he launches first funnel and I don't know how it's doing
 It's probably not gonna be the biggest homer in the world, but he launched it
 Okay, when he didn't have the resources he called his dad who does have resources dad help fund the thing and now
 he's building a webinar for his dad's business and he's gonna make money there right gig he
 Shifted from like I don't have the resources
 Thing that keep most people back to I need to be resourceful if I honestly believe in myself
 If I if I if I'm not making a fantasy by making an actual goal
 I believe I'm gonna hit it then I need to I need to put my money where I'm out this right
 So I'm watching and I'm seeing Andy Facebook live every day and like these things about how grateful he is the Garrett pushed him
 How grateful he was and then on the flip side I had people you know in the Facebook and other places who are like so mad about it
 Like oh, you should be doing that to people you shouldn't be doing things and and yeah
 The person to happen to was so grateful for the experience because it got them off there
 But it got them to shift you know it did the thing it needed to do and it's just interesting and
 You know kind of in in reflection for last week, you know
 It's interesting because like I didn't you guys see how I saw I don't sell hard like that. I I tell stories to break faults beliefs
 But what Garrett did was amazing and got so many people to shift and I know I guarantee I guarantee
 I like if I was a betting man, I bet on this I bet there'll be at least a dozen of not more people who come on stage
 Make sure you do comic-able war because Garrett did like made that shift and I bet you I bet you money Andy's gonna hit it too
 Anyway, we'll like we'll see but I think I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen
 And so anyway, I'm gonna put that out there because
 It's interesting. It made some people uncomfortable. That's why they were voiced in opinion was just totally cool. I understand that
 And it was again that wasn't I planned to prepare it or knew it was happening
 You know Garrett wasn't it happening just in the heat of the moment when you're coaching somebody through something like it
 It comes out and just anyway, it was interesting, but I'm grateful Garrett did it
 I know Andy's grateful that he did and I think that so many people
 Excuse me
 Who took that leap of faith because of that presentation it was it was fascinating then after that then
 Then my ring gold and I got back up and my ring shared some cool stories like he always does
 Just hanging people one last push like hey
 This is your last chance and we talked for 30 minutes and we said okay 30 minute countdown clock
 Is your last chance to have two comical backs and then it's done and then as soon as Brendan Bouchard sits on stage
 This offers gone. It's off the table and it's over and so boom. We did that had 30 minute break much more people signed up and
 And we launched year two of the two comical backs coaching program, which I'm really excited for we've got
 I think about I don't know exact numbers 550 people
 Signed up at the event plus an additional
 About 300 from last year who are who are in for round two, which is gonna be fun
 so it's a it's gonna be a simple about 800 people are so in the program and and this year is fun because we've got a
 Huge coaching infrastructure built in and oh she gets to see behind the scenes was happening. It's amazing
 So if we decide ever open this up during the year, you should jump in but right now we only sell it events
 So we'll see what happens in the future, but that was awesome then after the break
 I came back and Brendan Bouchard came up and did his high-performance Academy presentation talking about six habits of high performers and it was amazing like
 I love Brendan. I know him for more than a decade
 I've never actually seen him speak like that like you know
 It's a front row is his his his keynote presentation when he loves it. You tell the energy in the room was amazing
 He was jumping around like crazy. It was just it was it was all people laugh and they cried it was it was
 It was so good. I appreciate Brendan for coming in
 You know again
 I didn't pay him a penny
 He flew in his own dime to come out here and and to share with the group because he cares and because he believes
 Which was awesome so that when he was done then we broke to lunch
 Because we were way over time at this point. These things are supposed to do
 Just went way over time. We broke to lunch and all the two combo club expires
 We did a special waffle lunch for them and I chance to go in this I hide him really quick
 And then the kind of the coaching program began right there, which is exciting and then during lunch Lindsay Sterling
 Ah, this is so cool
 Lindsay Sterling came and like got everything set up for her her speakers and her everything their band showed up and
 Then we let inner circle in we let two comical effects come in every came in and then had a chance to meet Lindsay behind stage
 Really quickly and then she came out and gave this performance and I was excited
 I thought it was gonna be good
 But it was so much better than I had hoped for and then right came off after the performances down and came backstage
 And and all of the people on the production company were like that was insane like we were not expecting that that was
 It was so good like the performance was good the lights the music the like
 Everything was so good and then she would go to the mic everyone's one of them say things and like man
 She related to our audience so well like cuz she's a she's a marketer. I got straight
 She grew up on YouTube and all these things and they she told these stories that were about
 like you
 I wish
 I didn't know how to like explain it was so so amazing
 And when she got down that she went up really quick
 We took a quick break for her to kind of get reset everything and then I had a chance to bring her out on stage
 And I got an interviewer
 I asked some questions
 It was crazy because like I was leading questions like cuz I'm one of the answers and like the answer she gave her not what I was
 Leading towards but they were better like for example
 You guys know she was on an America got talent she made it three or four episodes in and then on the big national TV with like 30 million people watch
 she got kicked off and and
 And they told us she was no good and so I would ask her question about that because I wanted her to say like
 You know, but I realized like you know screw you I am good and I came back and I built my own thing
 But then her response was so much different and so much better than what I like what I dreamt of she was like
 she's like you know I went home after that and
 I've been watching myself on TV and and I had the realization that they were right. I wasn't good enough
 And she says, you know, so I kind of went back and for the next 18 months
 I went back and I learned how to dance better. I learned how to play violin better. I learned how to like
 Engage with the audience better. I learned this thing
 I spent 18 months to get where I could be good enough and then I went out and started doing these videos and these videos and like
 You know as you on YouTube the first video second third fourth and wasn't until I had this one video
 I'm crystallized and it was my best one so far and I put it out there and for some reason that one blew up boom
 And it built my following millions and millions of views in the first 24 hours and like and she like but that point
 I was good enough like I had worked I'd worked it and I'd earned it and I was finally good enough for the success and
 I was like getting chill. I got chills again telling story. I'm like, oh my gosh like
 You know somebody was thinking it's like no screw you like I'm good enough
 It's like no no no no it's someone's telling you I'm good enough like don't I don't
 Don't fight like that do it Lindsey and be like, you know what?
 I'm they're right. I'm not good enough and then get back to work and then you can become good enough and
 It was so powerful. That was like one of like her messages like there were so many so many good things. She's amazing
 Anyway, I can't even think her enough that was it was so much better than I'd hoped for so that was awesome
 And then and she works with OUR as well
 She's a bunch work with them and so we had her stay on stage. We brought up OUR
 And we gave them a check and it was funny is like I think I think we raised like I can't remember
 It's sort of like four hundred
 Four hundred and something thousand dollars. It's amazing right then and then we matched it so where I get
 50 something thousand dollars on my mom so the quilt for like 78,000
 So we were like I don't know exact numbers
 We're like a hundred thousand dollars away from a million
 I like I wanted a million so bad
 It's we had this big huge huge check in the back about red numbers on it
 And it was like, you know
 800 and whatever the number was and it's odd like do you want to surround it up?
 Mike what he means like let's just round it up like we should give him at least a million bucks
 I was like are you serious? He's like yep
 Like I love Utah
 So we rounded up to million bucks and we were able to give them a check for million dollars on stage
 Which was so cool two years in a row a million bucks each year
 Which that's and it's in the side you say like you know check like what's this for?
 It's for the lives of 400 children because that million dollars will save 400 children from slavery
 Which is amazing and I'm so grateful for every little click-fon community for
 Donating money and putting it out there like and so many guys
 You know I know after it for like in live last year went and like showed the documentary people people raised money people ran their own events like millions
 other dollars were produced because of
 What happened at fun hacking live and I'm sure the same thing happened this year as well
