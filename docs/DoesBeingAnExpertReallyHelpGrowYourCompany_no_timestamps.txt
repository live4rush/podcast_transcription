 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing secrets podcast
 This is a short one you're gonna get in the Jeep while I'm going to grab my kids in the last day of scout cab
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital?
 We're spending money from our own pockets
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everyone so I wanted to shoot you guys a quick message because I have been up in the mountains for the last
 Almost week now, so I got a sweet beard and those you can see my beard line. This is why I can't
 invest in a beard oil company or
 Grow a beard that matter. I don't know why I just never been able to my brother's got a beard just thicker than the hair on my head
 I can't so this is the best beard you are getting from for Russell
 Less I was about like Rogaine and rub it on my beard parts
 So I'm going back and forth and this little tank cabin the road with cars everywhere
 Anyway, if it would actually grow in thick I should try that someday, but I won't sound really want to be here to be completely honest
 So my message for you today. I wanted to throw this in so I've gotten
 So I just was my buddy's cabin and I tapped in there for a few minutes
 I got all the messages flying in and seeing my mister over last week and that was funny
 I got a bunch of people message me about my man John Reese's podcast
 So hopefully you guys are listening to it if not go to iTunes and search the wacky minor John Reese
 He is the dude who was the first guy to make a million dollars in our market
 he is one that inspired the two comic club award and
 He's inspired so much of what I do and someone who I appreciate
 He's become a friend. He's been a mentor and he's just pretty much the man
 So it's worth it go search the wacky minor John Reese and plug in I posted two podcasts as of today and I listened to both of them yesterday
 And they're awesome. I love it, but this is what I got a bunch of messages me saying
 Did you listen to John's podcast at the very end? He was totally talking trash about expert secrets
 I was laughing because I listened to the whole thing at the end
 I was listening as he was talking about how he doesn't believe people should need to be a personality
 things that to be successful in in their business and
 It's funny at that same one my I
 Facebook John and just said how much I will appreciate him and his podcast amazing and stuff
 Cuz I and obviously I look at things from a little of different angle than John does
 And doesn't mean anyone is right or wrong. That is what's so cool about this business
 marketing is
 I always tell people it's like this. It's an art and science, right?
 So the science is like the structure like pages and all that kind of stuff that we talk about geek out in our funnel world and then the art is
 is the stuff on top and
 People do different ways
 In different business models require more and less of those types of things
 It's what kind of depends what you're trying to do and what you're creating and things like that and so
 the reason I'm experts secrets and the reason why I'm so obsessed with that market is because I
 Believe in it so much. I believe that
 Personality and things like that in connection with audience where people are craving and I think you can add an expert front end to any
 Business and dramatically scale and we've proven it over and over and over and over and over again
 And it's awesome and John was basically saying like you don't have to have that again
 I think his message is right because a lot of people struggle because like they're not that
 Person that it want to be a personality
 I don't want to blog and Facebook and podcast and do the dog and pony show that I do every day
 And I totally understand that and respect that
 but
 What I am saying what I'm proposing from expert secret standpoint is if you do you will take what you are
 You have and blow it up on and catch it on fire
 I believe that I could go into any company who is product based company focusing on
 Traditional stuff and add an expert front end and at least 10x those companies in fact, that's a challenge
 I want somebody to take me up on so I would say first off John is right
 Second off, I'm also right and so it's just different ways to look at it
 And you know John's background is not he talked about the podcast
 So he didn't like being in the front and being all those kind of things which I totally respect that
 But when he did he made a million dollars in a day
 Just saying so there's something to that. There's power. There's
 The connection
 That you can get with somebody blow things up, right? The connection what gets people to share videos and gets people to talk about gets
 Things to grow and all those kind of things and without that connection it's harder to get not impossible
 Bill's is a built line all the time in fact
 I told someone appear want to start a business and ask me what I would recommend for them and just because their personality I was like
 I told them I said you start an Amazon business like that that makes more sense for you and the spot in your life for any
 Personality like because in Amazon business you don't have to have all those personality things, right?
 It's getting good product and good price getting a description images and doing the stuff to get ranked now
 If you want to take that and to blow it up
 Then I would find something if you're not that person partners somebody who can become the personality and use that person's personality to blow it up
 I could take any Amazon product off the shelf tied to personality and 10x overnight
 And that's the power so we're both right and just wanted you guys to know that I still love John even though
 He wasn't probably not talking about me specifically, but people as a whole so
 That said
 Yes
 We all bud
 Anyway, sorry these guys all think I'm weird because I'm the one dude out here
 Podcasting well, they're all scound it up. So anyway take that before it's worth
 Okay, so I love John loves advice and for those of you guys who are nervous about the expert stuff
 You can start a business that way just know that this is how you amplify and you scale
 You build a massive movement of people who buy over and over and over and over again
 People can make more people than brands. So um, hope that helps and I got for that guys. See y'all later
