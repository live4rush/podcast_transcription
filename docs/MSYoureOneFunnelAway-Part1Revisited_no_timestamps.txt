 >> You're listening to Marketing Secrets with your host, Russell Brunson.
 >> Hey everyone, it's Russell Brunson.
 Welcome to a special marketing secrets episode where I'm gonna let you guys see
 behind the scenes at one of our presentations from last year's Funnel Hacking Live.
 All right, so this presentation is one that I was really nervous about giving.
 It was called One Fun Only Way, which was a whole theme of the last Fun
 Hacking Live event and it's something that I wanted to share with my failures,
 my bankruptcy stories, the ups and the downs.
 Everyone here talks about the highlight reel, I wanted to share the other side of it.
 I don't typically release sessions from Funhacking Live anywhere, but
 this one has such a big impact on our audience and help people know that everyone,
 including me, especially me, has big ups and big downs.
 Yet literally we're just one fun away from success each time.
 And so as we are preparing for an extra fucking live, which will be coming live soon
 at FunhackingLive.com, I was kind of re-watching some of the presentations I saw,
 so when I was like, I want more people to have this.
 So I'm gonna break this episode into two episodes.
 This is episode number one.
 Go check it out and leave me a comment if you like it.
 Please subscribe, tell other people about it, and hopefully we'll give you some hope and some faith
 that the path you are on is right and that this process is gonna get you what you want
 and what you desire and let you have the best serve of other people.
 So that's the game plan now.
 Check out this episode and I'll see you on part two tomorrow.
 Okay, so what I wanna do is I wanna go on a journey with you guys, my journey,
 which started way back over here on my timeline and my backstory.
 So those who know me or have heard about me or know anything about this,
 I got started.
 Initially I started learning about business when I was a 12 or 13 year old kid.
 Sitting there with my dad, he was watching the news and I was watching it with him
 and I was sitting there and I'm like, I can't believe he hasn't told me to go to bed yet.
 This is the coolest thing in the world.
 And the news was on and then when the news ended, then Mash came on and I was like,
 I don't, you must think I'm asleep or something.
 Like he hasn't told me to go to bed and I'm sitting there like trying to move.
 I don't want him to know.
 As I'm watching Mash with my dad, I thought it was the coolest thing in the whole world.
 And then when Mash got done, like he still didn't say anything,
 I'm like, he's gotta be convinced I'm asleep.
 This is so cool.
 And then the next thing came on and it was an infomercial.
 Late that infomercial with Don the Pre.
 How many of you guys remember Don the Pre?
 Yes.
 Just an amazing person and he had an infomercial and I was so grateful for him
 and for his passion, his excitement, talking about what he was doing.
 And he was talking, the infomercial is out of place, tiny little classified ads,
 you can make a fortune, right?
 And it was, um, it was the coolest thing I remember sitting there listening to him.
 And I was like, this makes so much sense.
 I'm looking at my dad like, you pay attention to what's happening.
 Like this guy is, the whole thing made so much sense to me.
 He said, I took a class, I took a classified ad, I put it in a newspaper,
 and I made $30.
 And I told my friends and my family, like, I started a business, I made $30 this week,
 and they all laughed at me.
 He's like, so then I took that same ad and I ran it in a thousand newspapers the next month,
 and I made $30,000.
 And I was just like, mind blown.
 And I've been, I've been ruined from that day on when it came to the world.
 I'm like, I can't, like I can't not do something like this.
 I was so excited.
 I saved a bunch of money, mowing lawns and everything.
 And eventually I bought Don the Pre's kid on an infomercial.
 I read through it all.
 I learned it and I wasn't able to actually do anything though because I didn't have money
 to do direct mail and all sorts of things like that.
 But that's how I first heard about direct response market.
 I remember after I got Don the Pre's kid, I got so excited.
 I was at the grocery store with my mom one time and we're walking out and on the checkout stand
 there was a magazine.
 It was called Small Business Opportunity Magazine.
 Had a whole bunch of little cartoon people in front of me.
 Have you guys ever seen that magazine before?
 That's it.
 This is like the greatest, like, swipe file of direct response ads ever.
 I had no other time though.
 There's like 30 things talking about how to get rich quick.
 I was like, sweet, I want to get rich quick.
 That'd be awesome.
 Had my mom buy me this magazine.
 I went home and if you look at it, it's like 140 pages of ads and four pages of articles.
 It's pretty awesome.
 And so I'm looking at every single ad.
 I'm like, oh my gosh.
 I can sell gold chains at the mall and make money.
 And so I call this my 100 number for free info kit.
 I'm like, yeah.
 Free info kit.
 It sends my house.
 And the next page is like something else.
 Page after page.
 All 140 pages.
 I'm like, oh, I'm going to get rich quick.

 How many has one zip, Randir?
 The first 30 people in the back?
 No.
 It just doesn't work anymore.
 The coding all stopped working like 10 internets ago.
 So it's done.
 That was my first software product.
 It was so cool.
 About that time is when I started learning more about info products.
 That's when the potato gun came out.
 The potato gun DVD.
 All these things.
 I was just doing all these little businesses.
 None of them were like huge smashing like million dollar successes.
 I didn't pull Dan Henry and read a book and five months later made a million bucks.
 I was like, "Hey, I made five grand here.
 Oh, I made $200 here."
 These little things kept happening.
 It was so cool.
 Every project did a little bit better.
 It was like slow momentum.
 Everyone did a little bit better than the last one because I got more customers coming in
 and more people.
 I kept just making things in different markets.
 Potato guns.
 All these sorts of different things.
 Each one got a little bit better.
 It was just fun.
 I remember back then I started to tell the seminars.
 I was like, I get 30 people online and I talk about something and sell it at the end.
 People go buy it.
 It was so exciting.
 That was the start of this whole thing for me.
 Then one of my friends, BJ, who is sitting over here, he was the wrestler in Nebraska.
 I wrestled at Boise State.
 It was our senior year.
 I made probably $150, $200,000 somewhere in there, my senior year.
 He had heard about it.
 Boise State was wrestling Nebraska and we were sitting there wrestling and we were glaring
 each other because we were opposite teams.
 Afterwards he was like, "Hey, man.
 Sometimes you're making money.
 Is that true?"
 He was like, "How are you doing it?"
 We talked about it a little bit.
 We flew back to our place.
 We talked back and forth a little while.
 After college got in, he was like, "Hey, man.
 I want to do what you're doing.
 Can I get a job?"
 I was like, "You want a job?"
 He was like, "Yeah."
 I was like, "What would you do all day?"
 He was like, "I don't know.
 I'll do what you're doing."
 I was like, "Okay."
 We talked about marketing stuff.
 He was like, "Oh, I love talking about it.
 That would be so cool.
 I have nobody to talk about this stuff."
 I thought it was just me.
 I was like, "You're actually interested in this thing."
 He's like, "Yeah, man.
 I'll give you a job."
 He's like, "All right."
 He jumps in the plane, flies to Boise,
 and moves literally into her office,
 slept in her office for six months.
 He gets there and he's like, "Okay, how does this work?"
 I never had an employee before.
 I'm like, "I don't really know either.
 I'll pay you."
 We can talk about marketing.
 It will sell stuff.
 It will be awesome.
 Me as an entrepreneur, I was in this mode of eat what you kill.
 I'd sell something, make a bunch of money.
 I was like, "Sweet."
 Then we wouldn't do anything for four or five months.
 We'd create something to sell, make a bunch of money.
 That's kind of the model that I was on for a long time.
 Then BJ came and he wanted to be an employee.
 I was so excited, I'm like, "Sure."
 He's an employee.
 Then the weirdest thing happened is every two weeks he wanted to get paid,
 whether we made money or not.
 I had never heard of that, but I was like, "Okay, here's more money."
 Then two weeks later, I had more.
 I'm like, "Oh, crap.
 We haven't sold anything for a long time."
 Then he had some other friends that came along to write, "This is cool.
 I'm going to work for you too."
 I'm like, "All right, come on over, man.
 Let's get jobs."
 I gave them jobs, one of his buddies and his wife and some other people.
 I was like, "I got all these friends that want to talk about marketing with me.
 This is so fun."
 We had all these people coming over.
 Then the problem was that every two weeks they wanted to get paid.
 We weren't selling anything, so I'd go lock myself in the back room.
 I'm like, "Don't bug me, you guys.
 I got to make money so we can all hang out again."
 I closed the door and I started working and I'd be working.
 I'd be selling stuff.
 Then they'd be out there like, "Dude, can we help you?"
 I'm like, "Shut up.
 If you talk to me, I can't make money.
 I just pay you."
 I just go away.
 They're like, "We really feel bad that we want to help you, Russell."
 I'm like, "I don't have time to train you because otherwise we can't make money to pay payroll."
 That was like this thing.
 What's interesting is this is one of my first lessons in entrepreneur that was tough.
 I don't remember.
 I had five or six people at the time.
 We hired this video guy that was in so many sides to it.
 I can't tell you all of them.
 He was an Indian guy who had shorts when I'm to hear and he had a braid that went past
 his shorts because he told me in interviews, like, "Yeah, I'm a video guy."
 I'm like, "You can't even do videos."
 He's like, "Yeah, I got all sorts of video stuff."
 We hired him and then turned out he didn't know anything about video at all.
 I didn't dare to fire him because I had never fired anyone.
 I was so scared.
 Like, every day we're like, "I wish you'd just quit."
 I don't know what to do.
 It was just all these weird learning things.
 This went on for a while.
 It became horribly not fun for a long time.
 I kept going worse and worse and worse until the point where it was December.
 It was the beginning of December.
 It was freezing cold.
 I was looking at everything and every penny I'd ever made was gone.
 Every idea I had, how I could hustle and sell things to different markets was gone.
 I was just like, "I just drained.
 I don't know what to do."
 It was Christmas time.
 I was outside and I started going to go hang up lights around my house.
 Someone had sent me an iPod Nano and Stu McLaren had actually done an event.
 I don't know if Stu even knows this.
 He had sent me the links to it.
 I downloaded the links to this event on this iPod and plugged into my ears and I started
 like hanging up Christmas lights, which I had never done before.
 It's a horrible job.
 Turns out you can hire people to really cheat to do that.
 The lights look really straight.
 Mine were like, "It was really bad."
 I kept stapling through the wire which would then kill the lights.
 It was bad.
 My fingers were so numb.
 I had this little light coat on.
 I remember like, "Oh, my fingers were so numb."
 I had to have my gloves off to be able to squeeze the thing.
 I put them back in and get warm.
 I go back in.
 I didn't really want to go inside and get warm because I just sort of pressed because
 I knew that the next payroll was coming up in a week or so.
 I was like, "I don't have money.
 I don't know what to do."
 Tomorrow I need to go and tell these guys otherwise they're going to be really awkward
 when payroll does come.
 I'm like, "Ah, sorry guys."
 Tomorrow I have to go tell everybody this.
 I stayed outside in the cold because I didn't want to go in.
 I just try to think.
 I'm stapling these Christmas lights around the house.
 I'm listening to this audio.
 In the audio there's two different speakers talking about different business models.
 Back then we know none of them is called these things funnels.
 They talked about these different business models, what they were doing.
 One of them was an offline guy.
 His name is John All.
 This is what he talked about.
 He talked about him.
 He talked about attractive character.
 He said, "I have this thing that I've been doing where I came from.
 I've been doing where I create these CDs and then I tell them it's so controversial that
 I can't put it on the internet."
 Which is like the funniest thing ever.
 He's like, "So because that you got to pay me $5, that will ship you the CD."
 They said, "What happens is that I shipped in the CD but then that customer financed
 me sending them a sales letter."
 I was like, "Took that.
 It's like brilliant."
 I'm like, "We got to do that."
 I remember I had filmed the CD two years earlier or DVD and I was like, "We could do that.
 We could burn that DVD and we could start sending that out."
 So that was the first presentation was John Allens.
 The next presentation was this guy named Matt Basak who's become a close friend since
 and Matt was talking about his business model.
 He said, "What I do is I send out CDs and the people that buy CDs I call them on the
 phone and we sell them coaching."
 I was like, "You can call people on the phone."
 I'm like, "I'm an internet nerd."
 I'm like, "Wait, you people."
 I was super scared but I knew that there was a guy that worked for me at the time.
 One of my five or six friends who had sold things on the phone before and I was like, "Oh
 my gosh.
 What if we figured out something we could do where we could save this thing?
 It might actually be possible.
 I was like, "Hey, Christmas lights.
 I'm listening to stuff."
 I was like, "Oh my gosh.
 This plan, this funnel was going through my head."
 I'm like, "Okay, I think I figured out a blend of what these two guys are saying could
 actually work."
 So my time I got in the hang up Christmas lights, I texted all of them, "You guys,
 you don't know this yet, but we're about to go bankrupt."
 But I got an idea that I think can save it.
 Let's see it tomorrow morning early and I'm going to walk you through what I think could
 actually save this business, send.
 And they're all like texting back like, "What?"
 Like, "I'm going through bankruptcy."
 Like, "Oh yeah, we're about to."
 And luckily it's okay, let's all come in.
 So they all came in the next day and I was like, "You guys, I think I got a model.
 This is what we're going to do."
 I was like, "Remember that DVD I did two years ago and take that and it's going to be a free
 DVD.
 It's going to be so controversial.
 We can't sell on the internet.
 We'll charge."
 I think it was $4.95 shipping and handling.
 And we'll send this DVD out to them.
 And then inside the DVD we're going to have a sales letter where we're going to sell a
 $5,000, actually it's $5,500.
 I don't know why we said that price.
 It's $5,500.
 And they're like, "Cool.
 What do we sell?
 $5,500."
 I'm like, "I don't know.
 What do you guys want to sell?"
 All right.
 So then we had our whiteboard and we had our whiteboard right.
 Well, if someone's going to say it's $5,500, we have to be something amazing.
 Like, "What if we did this?"
 And we're like, "What if we did that?"
 And we made this huge list for like two hours of like all the amazingness.
 And I was like, "That would be awesome."
 But I'm not willing to do half of that stuff.
 So, okay, we're not going to have them sleep in my house.
 We're not going to have them do it.
 We kind of crossed out all these things, right?
 Okay.
 And right, okay.
 I'd actually be willing to sell this.
 I think people would actually buy that.
 Like, that would be insane.
 And so we took that.
 And then at the same time we added a newsletter.
 So if somebody bought a CD, they joined a newsletter that was $37 a month.
 So they came from here and they joined a newsletter.
 It's $37 a month.
 And that was the funnel.
 Now back then we have ClickFunnels.
 So luckily we had one or two nerds still working for us who were able to kind of put these pieces together.
 And we had this really rudimentary, like horrible looking funnel, but it was live within a day.
 And we said, "Okay, let's try it."
 And we had a little tiny email list.
 This is pre-Facebook, pre-is that in my space day.
 So back then we pushed some traffic to this.
 And we ended up selling a couple hundred of these CDs.
 And then in the CD we shipped out to them inside the chemist cells that are talking about this.
 And then it put people on a continuity program.
 And then we called everybody about CD and said, "Hey, you bought the CD.
 How would you like to come to Boise?"
 And we're going to give you this.
 And this was our Hail Mary pass.
 Like, "Please let this work."
 And so we did that.
 We focused on it.
 We drove traffic to it.
 And when all of a sudden done over the next like two week period of time, we got 800 people to get our free CD.
 From that way we used to do is everybody was on Continuity.
 So we had 800 people that were on this $37 a month continuity.
 But it was free for a month, so we didn't make any money here.
 But we had 800 people's phone numbers that we were able to call.
 And so we were calling them.
 And we didn't know anything about phone sales or anything.
 We were just like, "Hey man, you bought the CD.
 You want to come and hang out with Russell?"
 And they were like, "Yeah?"
 And in that two week period of time we sold 10 people at $5,500 a piece.
 Which ended up being 55k.
 And that funnel saved Christmas.
 That awesome.
 [applause]
 That was awesome.
 [applause]
 I was able to pay all of our payroll.
 We had somebody left over.
 It was awesome.
 And the coolest thing is, three days later, then this stuff started.
 And all these people on Continuity, and suddenly we had a business.
 This is where I learned the power of Continuity.
 David Fry, who's one of my favorite people in the whole world, he's in the audience here somewhere I think.
 He always says, "I can tell you if Continuity you don't have a business."
 And I never understood that till this.
 There's David smiling over there.
 I love that guy.
 And now I found out I have some of these people in there.
 So what happened?
 I don't know the math.
 800 times 37 a month.
 It's like 25k a month.
 We knew like we have Continuity now.
 Every single month we have 25k.
 And that means I can pay for employees.
 And I realized like you don't hire employees before you have Continuity.
 But now we have Continuity.
 Now we actually have people covered and we can actually focus and think.
 And that was the first funnel that really kind of saved things and turned it around for us.
