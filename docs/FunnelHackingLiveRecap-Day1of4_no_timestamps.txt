 What's up everybody it's Russell Brunson welcome to marketing seekers podcast today
 I'm gonna recap day number one of four of the funnel hacking live event
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 What's up everybody hope you guys who were here for like and live with us made at home safely and that you had a great
 Time the journey of last four days has been amazing. I found a full spot of quietness here
 But probably see people walking back and forth with their suitcases
 But hopefully that's alright with you guys. I just wanted to kind of over the next four days recap for my life
 A lot of you guys were there some you guys weren't the crazy ones weren't but all everybody else was there and those who crazy if not
 Come last time. I know you've got your tickets for next time already coming if not
 Depending when you go fun hacking live dot com has tickets for next year
 But it's gonna be pulled down either today or tomorrow
 So if you're ever taking shit go and get them for next year's event
 But I wanted kind of just spend all time over the next four days going through
 Some of the key takeaways key points and key ideas that happen at the event and so hopefully those you guys who who miss it
 Get some insights and you have more of a more reason to come next year. So
 Some of the things first off this year in in fall liking lives in the past they've been three days
 But for some reason
 Four or five months ago like two in the morning head this idea that like to get everything done
 I need to do it had happened in four days
 And so we shifted it to basically three and a half day event
 And we'll probably end being four days next year just to get all the cool stuff in that we're trying to plan
 It takes takes at least three and a half four days to change somebody's life
 And so we're trying to change three thousand plus people's lives. It's a lot of work, but I kind of give you an end
 Result of what happened and we'll kind of back back fill over the next few days
 This event was amazing. We raised over a million dollars for operation underground railroads who watched the video
 I'm wearing this shirt that everybody got and I'll talk about that here in a minute
 Number two we had 91 new people on stage. You got two comic club awards, which is amazing
 We're up to 258 people now that have achieved that with
 15 people who have made over 10
 Eight figures sorry 10 10 digits eight figures eight figures
 So over ten million dollars in a funnel who got their new award
 Which is a huge plaque twice as big as the two comic Club one plus they got these rings that are like two carrots of gold and four
 Carrots of diamonds so give those away, which was insanely cool as well
 and
 3000 plus people were here and then we launched our new two comic Club X coaching program to get people from zero to
 Million to million to ten and I'm not gonna
 Mike has shared the exact numbers of those who were there know that it was it was crazy
 30 days ago a grant card owns event. I got in stage and
 It did over three million dollars in sales in 90 minutes and this event we did again
 I'm not gonna give you exact numbers, but it was over ten million dollars in sales, which is insane a new
 World record it was more than that. It was it was crazy
 I'm not gonna share the numbers not because I don't mind sharing numbers more so because
 Grant card owns a three thousand or three million dollars like cash in the bank account into in that time
 This was different because there was two options there was eighteen hundred dollars a month or eighteen thousand dollars a year
 So if I was to say an exact number it would have been stomper math, which that's a joke for another day
 but it's basically it was amazing and I'm excited for the
 over
 650 plus people who decided to take that leap of faith and go on this journey over the next 12 months and in 12 months from now
 My guess is the most was guys will be back on stage my goal for next year is to have 500 people
 I've heard new people to get the two comic club award and from that we're gonna get dozens and dozens who get the
 The eight figure award so it was it's insane
 but
 Wanted to kind of recap. So one of the main reasons why we decided to do sex your day
 And probably seven or eight years months ago. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna share all the details of the story
 But I got a call from somebody who I respect in my entire life
 Who asked me if I would be willing to help with this project called operation underground railroad?
 I didn't know what that was the time
 I remember I jumped on that night
 I started Googling and searching and watching videos and I remember the feeling in fact if you guys watched fun
 Hacker TV that night I made a video and I said I feel like the direction of my life will be forever changed because of this and
 The other time we're planning fun hacking live and I'm like, how can we how can we weave operation underground railroad into fun hiking lab?
 like what's like what's the process? How do we do that and
 a few months later
 During a time a lot of prayer trying to figure out the best way to serve
 This audience and have our community to help them and I did that
 We needed to make a documentary and I was like well
 I don't know how to make a documentary
 But I met a guy named Nick Nanton a couple years earlier and I didn't know him super well
 I just knew that he he'd won six Emmys and like 50 different documentaries and this voice in my head said call Nick and
 I think I don't even know Nick's number so I messaged him on Facebook like amen. I need to talk to you
 This is like five minutes after the after I heard the voice my head say call Nick
 So I'm like okay. I'm doing doing what I'm told message Nick and
 And then I met and then got him on voxer and a voxam said hey man
 This is what I'm like
 I don't know how but I think we need to make a documentary about operational gun railroad are you in?
 He's like dude. I'm 100% in I said the only the only the only thing is we have to do this by
 Like a photo I can live we have to show it for my life is like dude
 That's not very much time like I know but it has to happen and he's like alright. We'll make it work and so
 over the last
 And five months since that call he's flown to Hades flown around the world filming documenting all these kind of things and
 Funnicking live with a chance to actually watch the documentary
 And so it was cool is we can work straight the day the event the very first presentation
 I had was was called funnel hackers
 We see things differently which was kind of the premise of the whole event. We had a really cool video
 I'm sure we'll post online here soon of
 Just kind of that concept and I was sharing different people in our community who have changed people's lives and their business that talked about
 Stacy and Paul who saved over ten thousand marriages I talked about Pamela Wiebel who saved hundreds and
 thousands of doctors lives and doctors suicide I talked about
 Annie Grace who's helped all sort of people break the chains of alcohol addiction
 They then talked about Tim Ballard who has saved over a thousand kids from sex trafficking and so I shared that
 No, initial presentation. I said tonight. We're gonna have a chance to watch this documentary together as a community
 And after I got off stage then Caitlyn Poland came on stage. Oh, so good
 she came up and talked about how she's built her culture and
 Man, it was good her whole presentation was amazing and I've heard her talk about this before I've been studying her like crazy
 One thing she said I mean there's so many good things one thing that I took away that was like
 She's talking about like you're empowering people become superheroes and change their life and she talked about funnel swag and about
 Swag she's like that's like they're superhero cape
 Like if you give them swag wearing your brand your logo your message your mission then they feel more empowered
 And they're literally every day putting on their superhero costume and I was like oh my gosh like
 You know, I've been a big believer in swag since funnel, you know
 The whole funnel hacker movement began and you know, we got tons and tons of shirt
 But this shirt for example, oh you are sure like this is one that I'm wearing right now
 Like this is this is now part of my superhero costume like I put this on and I'm out there ready to save kids
 And it was cool
 We actually had a funnel swag store here at Fun Liking Live event this year
 Which is the first time we've ever done that I think we're gonna start going harder and just swag because I want
 Everybody feeling more and more powerful every morning that when our community wakes up and they put on a funnels
 Funnel hacker shirt or I see I build funnels. I build follow up funnels are all different swag
 We have to empower them
 It's literally like your superhero costume and that was like one of amazing thousands of amazing things that she said during her presentation
 Man shoot I feel bad most speakers had a 30 minutes to speak and I wish that her and everyone can gone longer
 But she spoke and then right after her then we had Natalie Hotsen came up and Natalie she cracked me her first four slides
 Like I'm Natalie Hotsen. This is like this is me. I was broke then foot the next slide
 This is me. I peed my pants on live camera and then I made a two-comic level ward the end and it was like boom boom boom
 Everyone's like what and then she came back and told her a story about vulnerability and how
 You know her most one of her most vulnerable times when she was she's in the fitness industry and she's recording a video
 She actually petered pants on camera and how embarrassing it was and she should could have and probably should have hid that
 Instead she knows my most vulnerable thing
 I'm gonna share this because no one else is willing to talk about it
 So she shared this thing she wrote an ebook teaching women how to strengthen themselves
 They won't have that same promise she had and sold 60,000 copies of her ebook in four months and became a two-comic
 I went with the $37 ebook
 And it was just so cool. It's talked about power vulnerability and how to do it like real vulnerability not
 The trouble happens when it's coming in hard anyway real vulnerability not like the the type that some people try to put out there online and
 It was it was also amazing and so we still we led with two and most amazing women speakers
 We like in our community was for amazing and fun. I can I wish we had an almost half the women were half of speakers for women
 My goals for next year is to have more than half of them the speakers be women because our women are doing such amazing things
 I'm gonna let this lawnmower pass
 That's a recording live podcast right got a mic
 Anyway, they both spoke and it was it was amazing. I think it gave people faith and hope and understanding
 Of how to build a community then how to open up yourself as the leader
 Which is the hardest thing how to be vulnerable so many times we as leaders try to be so postured and perfect
 And trying to like put on a good face for people in the the reality is that actually pushes people away more than it
 Then it draws them to you and like actually breaking down your barriers and being vulnerable truly vulnerable not
 Not what does she call it she something like oh ever since the loss of us weight these pants make me look so you know
 These pants are so baggy that's like fake vulnerability the true vulnerability is like well
 I think she mentioned like I was the grocery store
 They saw my ex husband and and with his new girlfriend and it broke me down like that's something truly vulnerable
 You can share that has a bigger impact so both of the messages are so awesome then afterwards then
 after they both spoke then we had
 I got on stage with Todd Dickerson my partner and basically brought him on stage and
 And I introduced operation on road we had Tim Ballard come up and we had Nick Nanton
 both come up to talk about what they were doing and
 And they came up and we showed the trailer the documentary which is
 You guys now should go see now I posted live you go to oh you are film.org oh you are film.org or
 RG starts it if you go there you can actually see the trailer and if you do go watch it
 Please share it as well. I'm trying everyone in our community to share it, but oh you are film.org and we watch the trailer and
 and
 Everyone were crazy and I said you know this is a hard film to watch I'm actually seeing it
 Tim has the CD at Nick's alone with his senior
 But if you guys want to watch this type this we're gonna take a break we're gonna go do our round tables when you come back
 Or our speed network and make when you come back you can have a chance to
 To watch this together as a community, but it is hard to do if you're not able to come back
 I totally understand as well and so at that point oh, and then I basically talked about how
 If for anyone who is at the event unfortunately, this is only available at the event
 But $250 they would get the recordings event and I would go towards Operation Underground Railroad
 $2,500 would save a kid and $10,000 would save a kid and
 rehabilitate them and then they'd also sign for monthly you know monthly if they wanted to go under a recurring donation keep helping long-term and
 Basically, I told everybody that
 Todd this is Todd's I did the night before Todd said what if we matched everyone's donation?
 I'm like are you serious? So we decided anybody who donated we would match their donation and so
 That was going to put out there and from that a whole bunch of people went and started donating money, which was
 So cool. I think the first night we raised like two hundred and some thousand dollars and with our matches of four hundred thousand
 And so throughout the event we kept talking about them talking about that it was cool
 So then we broke and they had to spend our V dating the vendor speed dating we were having a chance to network me other vendors
 Yeah, we paid for dinner for everyone which is a big bill to feed three thousand people but everyone came in eight
 And it was cool. We got a chance to network and hang out and get to know each other
 Which is cool and then that ended we invited people come back in to watch the documentary and I would say we probably had
 conservatively 85% of everybody came back, which was really really cool and we watched the document together as a group and
 Man, I cried for an hour straight. I couldn't even compose myself
 Then we came on stage afterwards Nick and Tim and I and and we couldn't even man
 I couldn't compose myself. It was it was so hard and then
 We let people ask questions a lot people needed closure after that obviously and let people open mics and ask
 Tim questions and he responded and it was just so so cool and then we gave people a push like if you want to donate to charity again
 We're matching it go and go and help and I think that night we'd raise over three hundred thousand with our with which our match
 Made over six hundred thousand and that point Todd and I like let's see if we do a million
 I think we can do a million and so without a minute kept pushing that pushing that and
 Before lunch the final day we were just below a million dollars like in month days
 I'm like you guys we're just below a million dollars. I'm like and we also go in donate if you guys all donate 250 bucks
 I'm not only give the recordings this year's have been all give you according to all past years events as well
 And they went and did that everyone stepped up and we came back from from lunch
 We had just crossed the million dollar mark and it was cool. It was crazy. This is the best part of the story
 So the end of the documentary which you guys have a chance to see here soon
 In fact go to ou our film org and go and register
 We're gonna be doing a big huge live online premiere here of soon you can go registering and watch it with us together as a community
 But when we went there
 At the end of the documentary so I'm trying to catch my thoughts here at the end of the documentary
 I don't want to ruin it for you, but basically two of the children that Tim rescued
 He was he's been trying to adopt for the last like three and a half four years and
 He'd just gotten a call before he flew to our event that they were able to get him
 So he actually flew from our event to Haiti to pick up his children
 And so the last day right before Tony Robbins got on stage. We we were able to Skype in Tim Ballard from his home
 So cool Skype to man
 He was with his two the two new kids
 They just adopted and we got to see them meet them and then we had some the ou our operators who were there on
 On stage have they come up and we got this huge old check and we wrote the total one million dollars
 13,000 and whatever it was and we presented to the team and also to
 To Tim and I was super emotional and amazing and what's cool?
 It's Tony Robbins is their biggest donor right now
 He's raised more money than anybody else
 He actually went on a sting operation with them and went undercover and all sorts of crazy stuff
 So we did that and Tony came out right afterwards and it was talking all about them and and the mission and
 So cool. Hope thing was amazing. So I just wanted to give you guys a glimpse of that for those who missed it
 But I was day number one. It was an emotional day. I'm gonna go and bed that night and I was like
 We know we started noon that day was supposed to be half a day. We got done about midnight and I was just like
 Getting like that was an emotionally draining day. How are we gonna do three more days of this?
 But we did it was amazing. So that's the recap of day number one. I just want to share that with you guys
 So those who weren't here had a chance kind of here and see what happened
 I'll let the rolling bag go by as you can continue to hear me
 But that was day number one and it was awesome. So throughout this week, I'm gonna share I'm here with my kids at Disney for the rest of the week
 so I'm gonna
 Each day I'll kind of share each day kind of what happened to be takeaways and aha's
 But that was what happened to anyone. So for you guys right now, I recommend the biggest thing to you guys go to OUR film
