 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing seekers podcast today
 I need to share with you guys something very powerful from my friend. She's not really my friend yet
 But someday I hope so
 But her name is Harriet Tubman to me as may know her and her story by looking at a picture on my wall
 Where she is in it and there's something really coiler from her this weekend. I want to share with you guys
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right everybody welcome back and yes, I still am gonna give you all the podcast. I promise do not worry
 I will be getting those I just got a little more prep on them
 But I want to share something that I heard at church this week. That was so so so powerful
 Lot of you guys know how heavily involved we are with an organization called operation of down railroad, which is
 you know an organization that helps save children from sex slavery and
 What's interesting is I'm getting deeper and deeper in this organization and helping them
 Tim Ballard who is the man who started the thing?
 He's written five or six books on like ancient American history and I ancient American history, right?
 And I asked him why I'm like why are you so obsessed with this?
 He's like you know when we were trying to start this thing
 He's like no one had ever done it before he's like you know CIA asked us to go help these children
 We're trying to help these children from slavery and I was like
 We didn't have a blueprint or a game plan way to figure these things out and he's like so I started looking at you
 You know who's done the closest thing to what we're trying to do is like it was the early abolitionists who were trying to free the slaves
 He's like that's the people we studied and so there's a picture on my wall. It's amazing
 It's got this railroad down the middle and Tim is walking holding a child and he's walking towards it
 Towards you know towards me looking at the picture and then the left-hand side
 There's all the early abolitionists you see Harriet Tubman you see George Washington you see a ram Lincoln you see all these
 Amazing people that were the early abolitionists on the right hand side
 You see all the the modern abolitionists and all these amazing people that been part of the way you are mission
 And I have a frame to my desk here in the office one of my favorite
 pictures from the left-hand side there is Harriet Tubman and a church on Sunday
 Somebody was talking about her and about slavery and stuff like that and shared a quote
 That was so cool and this is the quote
 She said she said I freeed a thousand slaves
 But I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew that they were slaves
 Oh
 I read that again. I freed a thousand slaves, but I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew that they were slaves
 All right, so why don't I share with you guys well number one
 How powerful is that so many different levels?
 you know for for
 For me it's been interesting like when I first started learning about this whole business directory spawns internet marketing and the fact
 You sell information and you could you know all these things that I talk about the us all time now
 Oh, when I first learn all those things
 You know, I remember like how how freeing it was for me
 I was like oh my gosh like I I don't have to be a wrestling coach not that I don't want to be I want to be a wrestling coach
 But I don't have to be a wrestling coach making you know whatever a wrestling coach is make a year like I can I can do more
 I can be more and the awareness of this thing gave me gave me freedom
 Right and when I first started trying to teach the stuff, you know a decade ago at first like nobody seemed to care
 I remember being so frustrated like do people understand like what I'm sharing with them like this is this huge
 This huge thing
 I'm trying to give people freedom freedom to be able to choose and be able to create be able to do what they want to do
 And I kept trying to share this this thing with people
 But it was interesting because I don't at the time especially like this Harriet Tubman quote really strikes home to me because
 I was trying to free them, but they didn't know that they were enslaved and I fast for an hour a decade later
 I think it's been interesting like a couple things are more than I've gotten better my message
 Therefore, I've been better able to like capture people and get their attention to be able to like show them like look
 You're literally in the bonds of slavery it could be your work
 It could be your your job much money
 You're making like all these these things like I've told you I told you as before this podcast like my mission
 Is to help you guys to be able to make more money because I feel like it gives you freedom to actually do what you're supposed to do with life
 Right like my my admissions
 I couldn't care less if you just make more money
 I would all send them that does not matter to me
 It doesn't matter to you
 But I know that if I can it's like Mazzol has hierarchy of needs right like if I can make it where you're making of money that you're good
 Then you can stop looking inwardly like how do I make money?
 How do I support myself and also you start looking outwardly when you look outwardly at other people and I was like oh my gosh
 I can serve I can do things right?
 I know for me like I was able to have such a bigger impact on people when I wasn't stressed about my own finances
 Right when I was making good money then I could go and we could help organizations like village impact build schools in Africa like
 Operation and I got a railroad to save children from sex slavery
 They all these things were opened up to me when I wasn't looking internally like how am I gonna eat next week?
 How am I gonna make money right and so a big mission I have is that if I can give you that freedom
 We're not living paycheck to paycheck
 But where you're you have freedom time freedom energy for your money freedom
 Where now you can look outwardly now you've ability to serve and change people's lives right like first life
 we always changes our own by giving ourselves freedom and that's like now that I'm free I want to free other people and
 Again for me, it's like this Harriet Tubman quote was so powerful because for me it's like I could free so many more people
 If only they knew they were slaves right and that gives me motivation to come out and be like okay
 I need to be louder in my message and to be more aggressive in my marketing
 I got to figure out other hooks and angles and things I need to do because I need to convince people help them understand that
 They're in slavery because if I can do that and I can and I can get their attention long enough
 Or I can make a presentation and help them see the future and see the vision help them understand what's happening and cause enough pain
 But then show them the the picture that that creates enough pleasure for them to actually make that movement
 Then I can help free them right and so I share that you because that's my mission
 That's my thing but for whatever it is you do it's the same thing right you have a you have a mission with every product or service you
 So and it's different for every everyone right so you guys you're helping people lose weight some people you're helping
 Helping them in the stock markets and you guys are helping people
 You know what whatever it isn't and I could spend you know with with 80,000 plus click photos members now
 There's 80,000 different missions throughout there
 So you know I gave a couple broad generic ones, but your missions different right and you know what it is
 And and I know that you've helped some people. That's why you let you up right?
 That's why you do what you do you're like man. I help this person here someone bought my product and they had the success and like that lights you up and
 I wonder how many guys feel the same way I am like I I freed that person I freed this group of people
 I can free so many more if only they knew they were enslaved like for me that is a battle cry for me to speak
 Yes, like okay, these people are enslaved. I got to do more
 I got to do I got to convince them that they are that they're slaves because when they do I can free them
 Okay, and I think about my life like how many things
 Enslaved me right now, right like I I typically pretty healthy, but this weekend
 I didn't I think I was a little depressed because my torn out neck from wrestling
 I was like oh and so I ate a lot of garbage I should I was enslaved this food
 I couldn't stop it's like if you if that's your business where you're helping people to overcome
 You know weight gain or body image or health or whatever it is right tons of people are enslaved by that
 And they don't even know it
 But if you're aggressive enough you believe enough in your message that you go out there and you market it consistently day in and day
 And day in and day out to where you get better your voice becomes better
 Your ads become better your hooks your stories your offers all the things are putting out there to where you're able to start capturing people
 They don't know they're enslaved and then help them and give them that freedom like that is that is the message for today
 And so I want to show it to you guys just because like when I heard that message
 It was so powerful hearing that from Harry Tubman, but also it resonated me like oh my gosh
 I feel it same way I could free so many more people if only they knew they were enslaved
 And I hope that you hear that as well for your product your service your message whatever as you do and what you think like man
 I've I've freed these slaves. I've freed these people from the thing that's holding them back
 But I could free so many more if they only knew they were enslaved and then when you hear that that's your that's your battle cry
 That's you coming out saying okay
 I gotta I gotta make them aware that they're enslaved so I can free them and now it's time to go out there and
 Refine your message be more aggressive put out more ads throw out more hooks more stories more offers like do your thing get excited because
 You were littering free literally freeing somebody from the slavery that's holding them back
 Whatever area of life that you're trying to serve them at
 So yeah, I might take that quote and blow up my wall because when I heard it was a battle cry to me
 And I hope it's a battle cry to you. So that said I appreciate you guys keep doing what you're doing keep serving your audience
