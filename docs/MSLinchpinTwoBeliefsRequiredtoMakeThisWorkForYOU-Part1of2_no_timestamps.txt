 Hey, what's up everybody?
 This is Russell.
 Welcome back to the Marketing Secrets Podcast.
 And today I feel like I'm giving you guys a huge cheat code.
 This is something that I have not shared in a free format yet.
 I've talked about this in my high end, you know, Inner Circle Mastermind group, which
 is anywhere from $50,000 a year, $250,000 a year.
 I shared parts of it at Funnel Hacking Live last year.
 But this year's Funnel Hacking Live, we're going to go deep into this framework that
 I call the Linchpin, because I feel like this is the best way to grow and scale a business
 today.
 Obviously, you all know that I am obsessed with funnels, but this is the evolution of
 funnels.
 It's the evolution of the value ladder, it's the evolution of how we do everything.
 It's literally the thing that we did to grow ClickFunnels.
 And it's one little tweak and change we did that is the difference between ClickFunnels
 being like a $10 million your business and $100 million your business was this principle
 called the Linchpin.
 And it's interesting because I did this when we launched ClickFunnels, it was something
 that was kind of me and Todd hacking around.
 We figured out this thing to help grow ClickFunnels.
 And then after about two years, I forgot about it.
 And I shifted away from it stupidly as, you know, we do sometimes.
 And it wasn't until about two years ago, I was doing a presentation for Inner Circle,
 showing them how we grew and scaled ClickFunnels.
 And I realized that like I had forgotten and we'd stopped doing the thing that made us
 amazing.
 And so over the last 18 months or so, we've been doing this.
 If you've been watching what I'm doing, you're seeing it.
 And it is by far the thing that is growing our companies faster than anything else.
 We're doing it actually actually today.
 We're in the middle of doing a challenge with our new supplement company and we're using
 the Linchpin model to grow our supplement company continuity program.
 We're using it to launch our new personal development program.
 We did it to launch our video hosting platform.
 We're like, we're using it to grow ClickFunnels 2.0 at an astronomical rate.
 Like it is the key.
 My T's and I joke about it with the Inner Circle.
 Like, you know, the Mandalorian, we're like, this is the way.
 I can tell everyone, like this is the way.
 This is the way you grow and scale a company today.
 And just through this principle called the Linchpin.
 Now, again, I'm not shared much of this publicly yet.
 In fact, my social team posted something on my social day.
 Like, you know, if you're not using the Linchpin, your business will not succeed in 2025 or
 whatever.
 And everyone's like, what's the Linchpin?
 And nobody knew.
 And I was like, I haven't actually shared this publicly anywhere.
 So this is the first time.
 I hope you guys are excited.
 This is a presentation I did for one of my buddy, Onyx and Goll, has a webinar event he
 does with a whole bunch of people teaching webinars.
 And I was like, what can I share with these guys that nobody else would talk about, right?
 There's a lot of things you talk about webinars and scripting and the perfect webinar.
 But I was like, I want something different.
 So I shared the Linchpin formula specifically as it relates to webinars.
 Now this is not the full Linchpin.
 There's other pieces.
 There's high ticket stuff.
 There's a lot of other pieces that I didn't get into during this.
 But this is one of the best breakdowns I have of like the core principles you have to understand
 for the Linchpin to work for you.
 And so I want to give you guys this presentation.
 I'm doing it selfishly for two reasons.
 Number one, I want you to understand this concept because if you do, you're using ClickFunnels
 to build out your Linchpins.
 But number two is because this year's funnel hacking live is going to be different than
 any other year.
 Most years in the past, we, you know, I talk about a lot of different things.
 This year, everything we're teaching for the four day event is all pieces of the Linchpin.
 So you will hear these principles reinforced.
 You'll hear us going deep, deep, deep on them.
 You'll see best practices, hacks, tricks, tips, whatever you want to call them for every
 aspect of the Linchpin.
 And so when you hear this, the biggest thing I want you to take away from is like, I need
 to be a funnel hacking live this year because this is where Russell is going to spend four
 days going deep into this framework with us with some of the greatest marketers on the
 planet.
 So with that said, this is kind of a pre-self of funnel hacking live.
 If you don't have your ticket shit, you need to get them weird like 80 days away from funnel
 hacking live, which is crazy.
 It's insane, like less than three months away.
 So if you don't have your ticket shit, now is the time to go, go to funnelhackinglive.com,
 get your tickets.
 And as you're listening to this presentation, when you're thinking about how this can apply
 to your business specifically, and after you hear that, then go run as fast as you can,
 get your tickets funnel hacking live and make sure you're there so I can go deep with
 you for four days on this framework and how you can use it to grow and scale your company.
 Again, it is the evolution of a funnel.
 It's the evolution of the value ladder that gets, is the key.
 So all right, with that said, we're going to break this down into two different podcast
 episodes, podcast number one, it's called a two beliefs required to make the linchpin
 work for you.
 And so that's this first one.
 And then on episode number two, we'll come back and I'm going to show you guys three simple
 keys to building our linchpin.
 So that said, let's keep the first part of the presentation.
 Hey, what's up, everybody?
 Thank you, Tom.
 So much for the introduction.
 I'm so excited to be here with you guys today talking about webinars.
 And the reason why I'm so excited to talk about webinars is because webinars are literally
 a thing that changed my life forever.
 I know you guys know that.
 I know that, but it's completely true for me.
 And I'm going to tell you a little bit of my backstory that I'm going to jump into what
 I actually want to share with you guys.
 And I know there's so many good speakers talking about all sorts of things from like
 how to give a webinar, how to do presentations, how to close sales, how to do funnels, like
 all kinds of stuff.
 And I'm something different.
 I was trying to figure out what's something I can bring to you guys that's unique, that's
 different than what anybody else would actually talk about.
 And so I'm going to be teaching you guys a framework that kind of developed.
 And literally it's the difference between ClickFunnels being a $20 million dollar your
 company and it being a $200 million dollar your company.
 And it's just a little tweak to how we do our webinars that I've never seen anyone's talk
 about or really share.
 And so it's something that we figured out when we first launched ClickFunnels, we kept
 doing it and honestly nobody really copied us, which is kind of surprising so much so
 that we almost forgot about it for a season.
 And then when we realized that we kind of brought it back and ClickFunnels has been growing
 now faster than it ever has because of this one piece and that's something we'll be sharing
 with you guys today.
 But to kind of step back, I wanted to take you guys on a journey just to kind of how
 I got to the spots to become obsessed with webinars.
 And so hopefully this will be motivational for any of you guys who may not feel like
 you're good speakers, maybe you're just beginning out your career and you're trying
 to figure things out.
 So remember I had gotten in this whole internet marketing world.
 I was geeking out at having so much fun and this is now almost probably 20 years ago now.
 I was in college, I was wrestling at Boise State and that was kind of my journey and
 I started learning about internet marketing and became obsessed with that, I started reading
 all the ebooks and buying the courses and doing all the training and googling all the
 different keywords about how to make money and kind of became obsessed with that.
 And remember I started having a little bit of success here and there, not that I could
 make it a couple thousand dollars a month here and there.
 And then I remember at the time there was this big seminar going on and the big seminar was
 called the big seminars, Armin Morn's Big Seminar.
 And Armin was someone who was a mentor.
 In fact I remember I used to listen to Armin, he would do these teleseminars back in the
 day before we had webinars or videos, he would do teleseminars and usually the teleseminars
 would happen when I was at school or whatever.
 And so I would take the audio of it and I would burn it on a CD and I'd burn a whole bunch
 of CDs of Armin teaching internet marketing and then I'd go on these road trips where
 we'd be resting and so we'd be going from Boise up to Oregon and we'd have an 18 hour
 bus ride and so I'd be sitting in the back of the bus with my headphones on listening
 to Armin Morn and talk about internet marketing.
 And I got so excited like learning all these things and like understanding these principles
 and I remember about that time he was doing big seminar, I think it was big seminar four
 or something like that.
 And that was the big event in the industry and I was like I need to go, I want to go
 and tickets I think were a thousand dollars which was a lot of money plus you got flights
 and hotels and all the things right.
 But I was like that's what I got to be like I need to learn internet marketing from these
 people who are doing it and so I took a little money I've been making so far, bought a plane
 ticket, bought a hotel, got a ticket, flew out there and I attended the big seminar.
 Now I want you to kind of, I want you to kind of put this in perspective like this is awkward
 shy Russell.
 I know you have Russell who's kind of like trying to speak from stage and like I talk
 fast and all kind of stuff but I was like the nerdiest of the nerdy.
 I had glasses on, I had you know I wore a suit and tics I thought that's what business
 people did.
 I don't want to be embarrassing.
 I buzzed head like I was so shy I was so awkward so I get this event and all these people I
 sat in the back kind of hiding with my laptop like taking notes, ready to learn internet
 marketing right.
 I just remember the very first speaker got on stage and they started speaking and doing
 their presentation I was just mesmerizing.
 It was the coolest thing in the world to see the whole thing happen right.
 And so the speakers started speaking and after about 90 minutes or so he like made
 an offer and I was so confused.
 I didn't know the business the industry at all so that he made an offer and all some
 people started jumping up and running the back through him.
 And remember I think the offer was $2,000 and as people running back to the room I might
 confuse I look back and I'm doing the math.
 I'm counting the people one, two, three, four, so two, two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve.
 And my time he was done I think it was like 50 or 60 thousand dollars this guy had made.
 And I was like what did I just witness?
 Like that was insane.
 And then I was just I remember like the thrill and the emotion and all the stuff that just
 like I saw this thing and then the army gets on stage and announces the next speaker.
 Next speaker gets on stage and I'm like okay I'm going to learn internet marketing from
 this guy he's speaking talking about whatever and after 90 minutes he made an offer for $5,000
 packages he created and same people start popping ball to the audience, running to the
 back and I'm like what is happening?
 I'm counting the people like five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty,
 twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty,
 twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty
 and that guy made over $100,000 and I started watching this happen after speech, after speech,
 after speech for the three day event.
 And I was just blown away.
 I didn't even know what I was witnessing right but I was doing the math, figuring out
 the numbers and then the very last speaker was a guy named John Childers who was at the
 time was the number one public speaking coach, not public speaking like learning how to speak
 eloquently on stage and that kind of stuff but how to speak to sell.
 I still remember he got on stage and he's like there's two ways to make money as a speaker.
 First way is to become famous.
 The second way is to learn how to sell from stage and they started talking about all these
 famous people they got paid you know $100,000 to speak on stage or $250,000 on stage and
 they talked about me, him, he's like I'm nobody, no one knows my name but I get more
 than these guys for speaking from stage I don't know how to speak to sell.
 And he's like you guys saw this weekend you witnessed it right and I was like yeah I witnessed
 it.
 He's like if you want I can teach you how to sell from stage and then he made a pitch for
 $20,000 and everyone's running to the back and I'm running to the back and it was chaos
 right.
 And that was my first experience to seeing somebody speak to sell like one to many selling
 and I remember shy, awkward, introverted Russell 20 years ago who's like you know coming to
 learn internet marketing because I could sit behind a keyboard and a screen and never
 talk to a human and make money and also I'm saying this and I remember thinking my head
 I was like there are human beings who were just like me who literally put on pants the
 same way I do who stepped on stage and made $100,000 in an hour.
 That was more mind that I had bad them in a lifetime you know what I mean and they were
 doing that in an hour I saw over and over and over and over and I remember thinking I
 left that I have to learn the skill I have to learn how to do this like it became an
 obsession so I got home and I remember a little while later when my friends was running
 and he was like hey Russell do you want to speak at my event I was like yes I would love
 to and so I came to the event all I remember thinking my head was like okay last minute
 I went to I saw those speakers they were really good at selling but like they weren't
 teaching the best stuff like I know way more than these guys do and so I started going
 and writing my presentation and I was like I'm going to teach them everything I know I'm
 going to blow their minds they're going to give me tons of money and so I created what
 I thought was going to be the greatest presentation ever again on stage my very first event and
 I taught everything I did the sell and I didn't know how to sell in fact I remember my clothes
 was I'm not going to insult you like the others I'm not going to insult your intelligence
 like the other speakers I'm not going to try to tell them it's cost all I'm going to do
 is you know it's a thousand dollars whatever so I offered a thousand dollar offer and it
 was crickets nobody moved nobody got a stage usually we need a speaking person in the back
 and I'm just to crank up the music so you don't feel awkward as you're walking up stage
 that guy I don't think knew I was done because I just went you know my pitch was probably
 20 seconds long and so does this awkward quiet I'm standing at stage nobody moved I'm just
 like well that's it I kind of awkwardly walk off and everyone's kind of confused and the
 guy turns the music on and it was the worst thing ever and so people came over and they
 were like Russell has a great presentation good job good job and like it was that awkwardness
 of that whole thing and then and then after it all ended next period on stage I went back
 I'm like so how many did I sell and the guy looked at me he's like you didn't sell any
 I was like oh like oh I was so embarrassed I wanted to quit in fact I did for a few minutes
 I quit I remember I like left the room beeline to the elevator went to my hotel room I had
 I had you know I roomed to stay there for the whole time the event so I sat in the hotel
 room I was too scared to leave and for three days I remember I sat there watching movies
 on TV eating hog and dost and coconut shrimp from room service that's all I did for three
 days I was like I'm not gonna leave I want to see anybody else and then when I snuck out
 the last day to fly home and I was like I will never speak again that was the worst experience
 ever but then I kept seeing it see it happen people doing it over and over and over again
 I was like I have to learn skill and so then I started hiring actually public speaking coaches
 where I learned from from Bill Glaser Dan Kennedy from Armandmore and from John Childress
 from all these amazing speakers and eventually I learned how to actually sell from stage
 and then I started going to seminars and I would do I remember very first time I sold
 and somebody bought actually sold six I made a thousand dollar course and I sold six I
 was like I made six thousand dollars this is crazy I kept doing it get practicing it
 and I kept getting better my presentations are tweaking and fine tuning things getting
 better and better and better and I'm not during this presentation we talked about the scripting
 of I'm sure the other speakers talk about that but just understand that like this is
 a learnable skill I don't mean the most awkward person of all time to fast forward like 15
 years later I had a chance to speak at the 10x stage and did my 90 minute presentation
 did my pitch and we closed 3.2 million dollars in sales in 90 minutes which I believe is
 the world record nobody has tried has told me they beat that yeah I haven't seen it yet
 not that not like in payment plans like that was collected in 90 minutes in our in our
 stripe account so I went from being the worst of the worst literally blanking and zero sales
 to setting the world record of selling the most and so I want you to understand this
 is the learnable skill all you can learn is this powerful learning that's like it's different
 than like just teaching it's understanding persuasion and sales and those kind of things
 okay and so like I said there's going to be speakers I'm sure at this event to go deep
 into the psychology and how to speak and present and so but for me it's like that was the thing
 I spent next five or six years on the road speaking doing doing stage presentations and
 then 2008 hit and the speaking industry dried up and so there were no longer seminars happening
 around the world so we jumped online I was like I have to replicate this and so we started
 doing on teleseminars and so we did I remember doing teleseminars every single night selling
 stuff and teleseminars and then I remember this thing called go to webinar came out we
 are all freaking out like we can do a teleseminar but they can see our slides which was a big
 deal because most of us had been at the time we're doing slides at live events right and
 so I also were doing these webinars and go to webinar and we started making more money
 and so I remember the first year go to webinar came out we did 70 webinars and just got better
 and better and better and crushed it and kept doing more and more and more and then when
 ClickFunnels came out some of you have heard me tell the story before ClickFunnels came
 out and I'm like how are we going to sell this thing and so of course I did what every
 software company doesn't make a landing page had a trial started driving traffic to it
 and guess what happened nothing people weren't signing up and kept trying kept trying and
 know like no matter how many times I tried to sell this thing people weren't trying
 up and it was a free trial I mean this is crazy free trial why is nobody actually signing
 up and and joining ClickFunnels like this is the thing everybody needed you know eight
 years ago eight nine years ago like we were the first to market with anything like this
 and it was like everybody needed and so we're promoting and like nobody's signing up for
 us so confused I remember about six weeks into us launching ClickFunnels one of my friends
 like hey I have an event coming can you come and speak and sell ClickFunnels and I was like
 well here's reality right now it's free we have free trial nobody's buying it and he's like
 well I already have you on the sales page people planning you coming you need to get
 a presentation on ClickFunnels I was like what are you talking about like you have to
 get a presentation on ClickFunnels and I want you to sell it for $1000 and I'm like
 oh okay and so I remember still like the event was started it was in San Diego and he
 was streaming online so remember I actually started watching online I'm still emboysy
 in my my desk as I'm working as a presentation mechanic and you need to create a webinar
 presentation or a presentation that I can go to to sell ClickFunnels and so I pull up
 my old slide deck my old products back in the day and I started just like changing stuff
 over I okay well here's the new offer here's a new thing like what's the presentation
 I'm gonna craft this thing out and so I wrote this webinar presentation to sell $1000 version
 ClickFunnels I remember finishing it and then heading to the airport jumping into a plane
 flying to this place got there got a stage made my 90 minute presentation selling ClickFunnels
 for $1000 and I had no idea if it was gonna work and not work and I did the pitch at the
 end and have you ever seen a table rush before? Table rushes are one of the coolest
 feeling in the world I've ever experienced is beating someone in a wrestling match like
 getting your hand raised is the best feeling second best feeling table rush like it is
 amazing you see people running jumping over the tables and so I did my pitch that day
 and no kidding table rush people are literally jumping over tables fighting at the back trying
 to get the first people put their credit card in and I was like this is crazy I got just
 watching this whole thing happen right and so that night I remember we got the order
 forms we closed like I think it was like 60% of the room had signed up for ClickFunnels
 for $1000 version of it and remember that night I went to dinner with Todd and Dylan who
 my partners we created ClickFunnels together and we're all excited and celebrating and I was like
 do you guys understand what just happened? Like yeah we made some money finally like yay and I'm
 like no no no like like we have a presentation that converts I make yes I did on stage but we
 close 60% of the room like that's rare that's unique like I don't understand like how how
 important that or how powerful it is I'm like I'm like I can go home now in that presentation I can
 do it a thousand times over and over and over again I was like he doesn't understand like like
 we're gonna be rich and like they smile like we're gonna be rich like like crazy rich you have no
 idea and so they're like okay what's the next process like we're taking this presentation we're
 gonna do a webinar and so the next morning I'm flying home I start texting people like hey I have
 presentations converts to one new webinar with me and they're like yeah don't do it and some
 texting everyone you know everybody I know and starting doing these things and so that and so
 I get back home and literally this is how we launch ClickFunnels so I do webinars the first I do the
 webinar around me get home somebody's list and it did great and this is one lesson I want to give
 you that hopefully separate from my teaching is about this framework here in a second but
 the first lesson we understand is like I did the webinar presentation actually even one step
 further as I was leaving the hotel lobby to before I flew home I'm leaving I met someone in the lobby
 and they're like oh your presentation was so good I wish I could have bought it but the problem is
 I don't run a supplement company I'm a coach so I can't use ClickFunnels and what are you talking
 about? When your case study shows us supplements and I don't have a supplement company I'm a coach
 so I can't use ClickFunnels I'm like well you kidding me like I'm a coach too I have coaching
 I have courses like I probably you can use ClickFunnels for that. Are you serious like I had no idea I
 thought I had a supplement company for work I'm like what am I doing so she ran back in grab two
 or order forms grab two or friends that came out and they also ended up like while I'm leaving the
 lobby and so I realized I'm head like my presentation only showed supplement funnels I should show
 other funnels so as I'm flying I'm editing my slides and like okay let me show a coaching funnel
 and a network marketing funnel and so I'm like tweaking the presentation right so when I get home
 to Boise I do the very first webinar live someone's list I can't remember we have like 500 people
 registered I did the webinar and man it's been eight years I don't remember the numbers perfectly
 but it was something like we made 30 or 40 thousand dollars on the webinar which was great
 and then I had another webinar that was queued up for like four hours later so the first thing we did
 is I thought webinars over I looked at all the questions from go to webinar we we took the
 questions out and I started reading them I was like oh my gosh on slide 10 everyone's asking the
 same question like over and over again so I went back and I edited slide 10 and I questioned I
 came down I'm like oh on slide 32 they're asked this question oh and the pitch they're confused
 about this and so I spent two or three hours tweaking my slides getting everything done and
 then again three or four hours later we had the next webinar and almost the same size I think
 was like I think I had been in less people like four hundred fifty five hundred people had registered
 you know 250 whatever showed up we did the presentation and the second time it did a hundred
 thousand dollars in sales I was like oh my gosh this is amazing so then I took that same presentation
 went through it again pulled out the question went through again kept tweaking tweaking tweaking
 and I ended up doing that presentation I did anywhere from one to five times a week live
 for over a year I think it was like 70 or 80 times I did that presentation live and everything
 that I did live export the questions tweet slides export questions tweet slides I didn't do it most
 literally which is like I did a webinar good I'm gonna automate like I wanted to master this
 presentation I got better and better and better and better and better and better in fact in my
 hard drive my computer every time I would do the presentation I would take it I would save that one
 and then my next webinar I would re-save it I have the date on top of it and then I would go and I
 would export questions and redo it so I have a folder on my computer which has like 80 whatever
 versions of that webinar everyone redone redone redone will tweak changes tweak changes and over
 time that presentation became perfect right I knew that if I was on a live webinar I would close 15%
 every single time if I was in a room it'd be 45 to 50% of people in the room would close every
 single time like just because we've done it so many times and so for those of you who are doing
 presentations and webinars like understanding like that's the magic like like doing the presentation
 then doing it again and doing it again and doing it again and crafting and perfecting it because if
 I would have perfected it at 8% clickphones would have done well but I perfected at 15% 16%
 right I mean twice in my sales was same amount of traffic it changes all the metrics everything
 changes right and so and then I did it for over a year before we ever automated and ever greened it so
 there's a couple rust listens I want to share with you guys before I get into the actual framework
 because I think those are key things to understand like this is the learnable skill you got to
 practice it you got to get better you got to understand presentations like the psychology how
 to actually craft them and then also it's doing it and then doing it again and doing it again and
 doing it again but if you get one webinar that works that'll change your life forever right that
 one webinar went from us having this click funnel thing we were at the bottom of our business we
 were making home a bit hardly any minute at the time we put everything into this developing the
 software that wasn't selling when first launched it got one correct webinar pitch and it changed
 the world changed us forever right next year we will pass a billion dollars in sales from that one
 from click funnels which is crazy maybe in business 10 years yet we'll pass a billion dollars in sales
 all off the back of this one webinar so that's the power of what webinars can do for you again
 but today what I want to talk about is again I want to share something unique I know you have a lot
 of people talking about a lot of different pieces of webinar I'm like what's the piece I can bring
 that's different than anything else and so if we can zoom out real quick this is this is the framework
 we developed it's called the linchpin and so I'm going to talk about this framework I'm not going
 through all of it there's a lot of pieces I'm talking about the two or three pieces that were
 the big needle driver this is the difference between click funnels being a 20 million dollar
 a year company and a 200 million dollar company was understanding a couple little pieces here
 now most of you guys are doing all these things right now anyway some of you already are doing
 virtual events some of you are doing webinars some of you are doing challenges some of you have
 caught in you but if you look at if you look through the things if you look through your business or
 lens I'm going to share with you a couple of things are going to be uncomfortable because
 like but I do it this way but I do this way I'm already doing this this way it's going to be a
 little uncomfortable but these are the shifts and the changes if you are willing to make these changes
 it will exponentially grow your business okay it's the reason why we're still able to outspend
 all of our competitors even people have literally gotten hundreds of millions of dollars of VC capital
 because of this framework right here and how it all works okay so again I call it the linchpin
 there's something I only work on right now we only work out with people in Santa Manor Circle
 my high-end coaching programs eventually we have a book coming out and some other stuff but
 this is the first time I really shared it publicly outside of just in my world and so I'm hoping
 that you guys grasp it so again there's gonna be some things that it's gonna it's gonna take
 some of the conventional wisdom and things you're used to and kind of flip them on their heads so
 I want you to for a minute to say no instead of saying no Russell no Russell when you say what
 if what if Russell's not crazy what if Russell built a 200 million dollar your company off of the back
 of one webinar maybe he knows one or two things trust him again so that's kind of game plan so
 there's two core principles that we have to kind of lead with for this whole thing to make sense okay
 principle number one this is something I learned from David Fry who's one of my friends and
 mentors when smartest guys in our industry uh David Fry said something really powerfully one time he
 said if you don't have continuity then you don't have a business can that's gonna be hard for some
 of you guys some of you guys like I have webinars that make a hundred thousand dollars a month webinars
 do you have continuity no you don't have a business you have a promotion which is great
 that promotion is amazing you make a hundred thousand dollars every single time you do it which is
 awesome but if you don't have continuity you don't have a business okay now I didn't understand
 I was just like you for a long time I was really good at webinars so I'd go to an event I'd speak
 on stage I'd do a webinar I'd make a bunch of money I'd take three months off like I like I get
 it like that was the world that we lived in right but David Fry said this if you don't have continuity
 you don't have a business and for me that was really hard I didn't understand it until I started
 building click funnels okay when I started building click funnels everything I did um you sort of
 like the the principle of compounding interest or I think Zainstein said it's like eighth one in
 the world compounding interest is great but what's even better than compounding interest is compounding
 continuity okay this is the key when you start shifting and you start building out your business
 inside what I'm this linchpin model I'm gonna share with you guys every single thing you're doing
 every webinar every challenge every live event every let me go live every everything is all
 compounding your continuity program okay and the time I really got this launch click fun I started
 growing and it was interesting because like our continuity you know you guys have this stripe
 app on your phone every morning wake up and then like stripe pops up and it's like how much money
 made the night before or that how much money made that morning whatever it is right it pops up
 every single day it's the greatest thing in the world like I remember when click phones came out
 remember first start popping up and it's like how many thousand bucks today haven't got a bed yet
 this is amazing right but we kept doing this process we're playing this playbook get added
 more people continuity and that continuity start continuity numbers are growing went from a thousand
 dollars a day to five thousand dollars a day from five thousand dollars a day to the ten thousand
 dollars a day ten thousand to fifty fifty to a hundred hundred hundred hundred fifty three hundred
 right and like every morning wake up and like I have not got out of bed yet we already made
 three hundred fifty thousand dollars a day like that's the power okay like having a
 promotion is great whole bunch of money goes away but compounding continuity is the key this is how
 you actually have a business so number one thing what you think about is whatever it is you are
 selling don't sell a course or product one time create something that's actually continuity okay
 we're doing this now I'll show you some examples we're doing this with Dan Kennedy's company we're
 doing with our company it doesn't matter it can be software it can be info products it can be
 supplements like I'm doing in all those industries but the the core fundamental fundamental principle
 in our businesses if we don't have continuity we don't have a business okay that's the first thing
 I understand so if you look at the linchpin model right here down here in this corner this
 is continuity so everything we have is leading to this everything is compounding continuity the
 front end traffic the challenges the webinars the live events everything's goal the only goal is
 to get more and more people into continuity that's it okay so that's the first premise for you to
 understand that promise you guys this is why most people get wrong like they at the end of their
 present so that here's a challenge webinar so you challenge webinar then it be so thousand or
 two thousand your five thousand our course make a bunch of money and then it goes away okay instead
 we're gonna I'm gonna talk about submitted but how we shift our offers so everything's continuity and
 that will change everything your business okay so premise number one is if you don't have continuity
 you don't have a business premise number two is we have to move the SLO SLO SLO stands for self-liquidating
 offer okay now most you guys in this room I'm sure understand what a self-liquidating offer is and
 so I'm going to show you is what what traditionally happens for most most people in the webinar
 business right in fact this is what we first launched click for when I first did the first
 five six webinars this is exactly what we did okay so what would happen is we would drive traffic
 to a webinar registration page right so here's registration page people email in here they submit
 and then from there we would take them to a thank you page right so register
 the research webinar thank you page thank you for reaching webinar hope you enjoy it here's day
 and time right and sometimes you put in a special offer right here which is again we call it SLO a
 self-liquidating offer so we might have something what's like a seventeen dollar ebook or a twenty
 seven dollar video or whatever I mean that's some like self-liquidating offer okay it's what
 people do is they go and you spend some money over here with Zuckerberg right you spend let's say
 spend a hundred dollars in ads from that you get ten people to register and then from that you get
 three people to buy the self-liquidating offer and hopefully we call it self-liquidating offer
 because hopefully make that hundred dollars back and that way you got all the registers for free
 that's the goal traditionally with a self-liquidating offer right okay and then from there and the
 webinar happens so you do the actual webinar and the end of the webinar you sell something right you sell
 your thousand two thousand five thousand our course there it is and this is where most of you guys
 actually end up making your money all right so let's just say for numbers sake i'm gonna say
 thousand dollars okay being sold obviously for everyone but say this is where you sell your product
 and that becomes your thousand dollar offer okay so that's what we launched click funnels um
 initially that's not what we did that was the that was the play and so we drive traffic people
 register the key page we sell um whatever it was i can remember was a seventeen eighteen twenty dollar
 product try to cover ad costs i do webinar i sell thing at the end and at first it worked first four
 five webinars like i'm doing this making you know again thirty grand first one hundred grand next
 one next i'm doing you know fifty grand my webinar for webinar i'm like i'm in my element i'm running
 i'm doing my webinars and um and i wouldn't have changed anything but luckily for me i have a
 business partner who's way smarter than me uh some he has no Todd Dickerson Todd's one who built
 click funnels initially um and Todd was like i didn't get in the software business to get back
 in the webinar business i'm like but what do we're killed we're making tons of money he's like
 yeah but all that money is just one off sales right if you don't have continuity or have a business
 and Todd was like i didn't get in the software business to get back in the product launch
 business we're launching you know like when we're also does something we make money but otherwise
 we don't he's like i need like the whole purpose of this was recurring income and i was like well
 at the end you know like we're we're giving people years access your access to click fun so i'm
 thinking 12 months from now they'll start getting billed the 97 dollars a month whatever it was at
 the time so if there'll be continuity but not for a year if now he's like that i was like
 like we need continuity now like like that's the whole reason why we started a software company
 and so when Todd had this brilliant idea it's so simple it's so dumb it's so easy but this is the
 difference this one i'll show you guys i hope you guys understand here in this linchpin model
 what Todd's big idea was like what if instead of having our self-liquidating offer here we got
 rid of that and on the thank you page we gave people a trial to our continuity program okay really
 really simple and so we did that and at first it was weird people registered they paid the thing
 they get trial but we didn't make any money right i'll get right but it's 30 day trial
 30 day and the end of 30 days then they started getting billed the 97 dollars a month right
 and so we started doing that we started shifting what was cool is people registered webinar from
 here we get a bunch of people that would sign for the free trial then the webinar happened the
 end of it i would sell this course that we bundled with 12 months worth of click funnels and that
 was kind of the process and so we ran that playbook for a year okay now i want to show you guys the
 numbers you know in a year because at first i didn't really get the impact of it until we were a year
 into business so click phones in business for a year at the end of the year a couple cool things
 happen i number one we had 2,500 people that bought this right so 2,500 people times 1000 equals what
 you guys know the math right business math easy 2.5 million and that's a huge success are most
 like you did two and a half million dollars in sales your first year that's crazy right
 in our world we give away two common clubs that's two and a half two common club awards like this
 is amazing okay but what you would have missed is a couple things um for the we had 2,500 people
 who bought the thing but what's crazy is from this trial fast forward 365 days from that we actually
 had 7,500 people who stuck on continuity so after the cancel refunds all kinds of things
 7,500 people stuck on continuity okay 7,500 times 97 dollars i'm gonna write 100 because it's easier
 for my my math brain 750,000 dollars a month in recurring income times that by 12 months equals
 9 million dollars what wait what the SLO trial thing made you 9 million most people are missing
 the 9 million because they're so focused on the 2 million okay now what i mean by moving the SLO
 moving the self liquidating offer we started looking at our business different we started saying
 this thousand dollars is not our business for most you guys that is your business right now the thing
 you sell at the end of the webinar is your business for me it's not this is my self liquidating offer
 okay this 2.5 million dollars i'd not pocket any of that we took that 2.5 million dollars and we
 dumped it back into ads over here okay so the 2.5 got dumped into ads and kept growing and kept
 growing everyone kept falling here in the trial and this became what we call compounding continuity
 kept growing and growing and growing and getting bigger and getting bigger and getting bigger and
 getting bigger you guys getting this okay so these two little tiny shifts two little shifts and they're
 not difficult it's but it's the shift in mindset number one you have to understand you're not in the
 course business you're not in the software but like you're in the continuity business for this model
 to work you have to understand so you have to change it okay change it from whatever you're selling
 from like i'm selling a thousand dollar course too i am selling a continuity program and it's
 it's a thousand dollars a year it's hundred dollars whatever it is like it's shifting your business
 understand that the thing you were selling is always continuity everything else is just
 dependent just to that and number two is you moving the self liquidating offer from the thank you page
 to the thing that you think is your business right now will become your self liquidating offer
 okay Dan Kennedy my number one mentor in this business he always says whoever can spend the most
 money to acquire customer wins the reason why i can beat everybody else is because the thing that
 ever else is their business i dump 100% that back into advertising and it brings people back through
 and the continuity is the key okay so those the two caveats we got to kind of get out the door
 initially for this whole model to make sense is that that cool he is getting so far
 all right everyone that's part one i hope you enjoyed it so far hopefully you're seeing like oh
 this is why Russell so excited this is you know compounding continuity like that's the goal like
 this is gonna be so exciting so hopefully enjoyed part number one again on part number two next
 episode we're gonna go into the three simple keys you need to actually start building out your
 linchpin and so far those who saw this presentation especially my internal team who have seen me talk
 about the linchpin a lot they said that this is the simplest and clearest way i've ever taught it
 before so it should you know if you've been struggling to understand this you know clear up a lot of
 things for you make this even more simple for you so with that said though if you if you're starting
 to see what i'm going here and why it's so important again we're spending four days together in Orlando
 Florida in a couple months with the entire funnel hacking community going deep on the linchpin
 at this year's funnel hacking live event so if you don't even take it yet now is the time go to
 funnel hacking live.com it's going to be amazing experience and i want you there all right that's
 so thanks so much you guys and we'll see you on the next episode
