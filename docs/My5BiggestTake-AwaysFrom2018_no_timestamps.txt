 Hey, what's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing seekers podcast. I'm so excited to have you here
 In fact today. I'm gonna be going over all of the biggest lessons I learned during 2018 is I'm getting prepared for world domination in
 2019
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome the marketing seekers
 Hey everyone, I haven't wanted this podcast for a while in fact
 I think my brother who edits this these podcasts is about to kill me because I keep telling them to record this
 I'm gonna record I'm gonna record I haven't and then and I was gonna record it like
 During Christmas break and then during New Year's and then now New Year's is over and then tomorrow
 I'm going on the two comma club X crews and I still don't record it. I was like, okay, I'm doing this so
 And I think the reason why is because I don't there's so many amazing things this year was insane like I
 It's still hard for me to fathom everything that happened
 Over the last 12 months
 You know last year we ended the year really really good. We went from
 Yeah, like I mean think about quick as long as year one we did
 Well first year is like three months. So whatever a million bucks, right?
 Whatever it was but the first full year was 10 million the second one was 30 million the third year was
 70 something million and this should be passed over 100 million, which is crazy. It's insane like I didn't think that was
 even possible
 But it did and like there's so many things that you learn at scale when things get bigger
 the the
 The positive things at scale are way better and the negative things are way worse
 And there's just so much stuff and there's so many things I want to cover and talk about and I was like
 How do I break these into a bunch of things?
 And so I kind of broke them down into one two three four five five different things
 They weren't like the full con you know everything I learned from here
 But I think some really powerful things that
 We're good that I want to share that think will help you guys
 So that is kind of the the goal and the game plan some of these things are personal some are business some are management some are
 Long-term strategic thinking there's a bunch of different things in between so
 With that said I'm gonna jump right into this
 All right, so number one the first thing
 That think was really really big this year
 was shifting a lot of like how
 What's the best way to say like?
 It has to do with health, but it's not like being healthy right wasn't like I was eating different to to get a six pack
 Some day I still want one, but that wasn't the reason why it wasn't like eating healthy to like to look at it
 It was like eating healthy because I need to put better fuel in my body right? I realized that I'm competing against entrepreneurs all different levels
 I'm competing against companies to get hundreds of millions dollars in funding like I'm competing against people that have you know a team of
 You know 2,000 employees working with them. I'm competing as people have
 You know 30 different people with MBAs working for like that's from competing against right?
 I was like how do I how to compete against these people like I can't do it based on more schooling or more money
 I actually based on more energy like the output that I'm able to put into the work that I'm doing and my team and everything
 and so I had a big realization like I needed to change like the fuel that I'm putting into my body and
 It's interesting now. I'm gonna share this with you guys and some of you guys are gonna think that I'm completely ridiculous and I probably am
 But I want to put a perspective because I know a lot of times people so I can't eat healthy because it's too expensive and I think that's
 For most of you guys like it's one of those things like eating healthier
 Well actually in most situations if you're an entrepreneur and you're building a business
 It shouldn't make you more money and it should be like one of the number one focuses and so I started shifting the way
 A and what I was eating and it kind of started with I was listening to a podcast with Tony Robbins and Tim Ferris
 I believe and Tim was asking Tony like well, what's your morning routine?
 What do you eat and it was so funny cuz Tony's like for breakfast. I've salmon for lunch. I have salmon for dinner
 I have salmon and you know you have salmon three meals a day and Tony's like, yeah, it's not food for me. It's fuel and
 Now the negative side of that is Tony ended up getting mercury poisoning from too much salmon
 So that's not necessarily the right thing, but the the statement he made is like it's just fuel for me
 It's not food. It's just fuel
 I'm just eating to have the the fuel for the energy I need to be able to produce what I got to produce today
 And that had the impact on me like I heard that I was like, oh my gosh like look at this on this crap
 I
 It's not good for me and I still don't eat amazing all the time right like that's that's why I don't have my six
 I still got my love handles. We're going on the two comical bex screws tomorrow
 I'm like dang it. I was gonna have a six pack by now, but I don't not even close but
 but
 like I
 I'm using food for fuel and so the way I eat is different now like in the mornings I wake up
 And it's like it what's the fuel I need right now?
 And so for me, it's a lot of water right? Alex Sharf and drilled that in my head and so I drink a ton of water
 I hyperhydrate in the morning right and then look at the supplements I take I'm a big believer in ketones
 And not that I'm in a ketogenic diet. I think there's there's a fuel in ketones, so I always do prove its
 supplements every single morning and every single night. I love their their ketone supplement and
 Not because I'm biased they built a company. I had a little piece in it, but
 You know Brian under when the team over there they built an amazing company they became the category king
 In ketosis and so like their supplements are second to none like they
 I know behind the scenes of the science of what they've been doing and they're on the I think they're fourth versions of the ketone salts
 And it's just like everyone else if you're buying this stuff like ketone salts on the market like they're using salts from from like
 Like generation one generation two and these guys are already like number four like what they have is so much
 Superior and it's good. So even if you're not like it tells this diet like you taking the ketones as good as fuel for your brain
 It makes you feel good and it tastes like candy so that helps
 Number two I found this other ketone drinks called H
 It's called human HVMM and it's expensive there 30 bucks a shot in fact
 I'm about to take one like get off this podcast the $30 a shot you take a thing and like I feel it's fuel like it dumps into your body
 And it's it's amazing it's ketone esters, but it's $30 per shot right the proof of things like five bucks a shot
 So between just those two things like I'm it I'm at $35 in fuel like first thing in the morning along with my water
 Right and then the next thing I have is I've been lifting heavy as well
 And so because I need more proteins than I normally do in my life
 And so try to get more proteins in and I'm allergic to whey protein
 It's like if I put whey fuel into my body like it I literally swell up
 I get tired like it does all sorts of bad things for me
 So what I do is I do a bag of brombroff it and the bone broth is not cheap either
 It's $30 a bag for this bone broth that I drink
 It's like by by lunchtime. I'm at 30 60 60 60 $65
 Just between the ketones and the bone broth, right?
 But that's fuel I'm putting into my body and then the supplements like I'm probably close to a hundred bucks a day in
 in fuel supplements I'm putting into my body
 And it has meant the world the difference like my energy level my excitement the the my ability to produce is better
 I better fuel my body right and so that was kind of the first thing
 And I know most years I'm not gonna spend a hundred dollars a day on on fuel for your for your body like I am
 But I would recommend this year's to like start thinking about like food is fuel right and there's times of foods not fuel
 There's times when like I go up my wife and the food I'm eating is not for fuel
 It's for social thing right and I know that like hey, we're gonna sushi. This is not fuel
 This is social hour
 So I'm gonna have whatever I want as much as I want I'm just gonna pig out because I don't need to be on right now
 I just need to to socially eat and that's what I'm doing. I'm gonna enjoy the process right?
 So I'm not like I'm not the hardcore weight loss guy. He was like I'm never gonna eat healthy
 It's like I know when to be healthy and like if I do want to eat junk
 I eat it at night and for go to bed that way I can fall pass out on my body
 I figure out how did I just all that crap and get it out of me?
 So I've energy again for the next day, right?
 But during the day man, I'm eating healthy all the time to make sure I've got the energy to be able to accomplish all that
 I'm doing and so that was kind of first thing this year is just
 That big aha from Tony Robbins, which was this is just my fuel. This is not food
 This is my fuel and looking at from that lens and it shifted how I started looking at stuff and shifted how I was investing the man
 and finally if I was you know, I
 Think Sharfen said like if you if you had a million dollar race horse like what would you feed it?
 You wouldn't feed it McDonald's and fast food you'd feed it the best food you can right?
 It's like you are the jockey you're the the race horse of for your company that you should be doing the same thing
 And then when Tony said, you know food is fuel. I was like, okay, that's it like
 What am I feeling my body with and so throughout the day? I feel good and I wish I was perfect because again
 I wouldn't eat garbage at night or on weekends or whatever, but
 I'm not there yet. Maybe this year will be the year that that happens in next to comic club at two comic club X
 Cruz, I'll have a six pack, but until then
 I'm looking at food as fuel. So there's number one item or two
 We've done a lot of funnels tons of funnels millions of funnels not really millions
 But you may know that I'm slightly obsessed with them and every time I see a new funnel type
 I try it out we test it which I have a bunch of stuff and I think I have a new favorite type of funnel
 And we relaunch it yesterday. So if you go to one funnel way calm, you'll see our one funnel way challenge
 I am obsessed with challenges earlier this year Natasha Hazel is going to be speaking at funnel hacking live
 She wrote a book and she started selling it through traditional book funnel and did okay, but didn't really crush it and
 And so she decided to change that from a book funnel into this challenge for what she kind of made it
 So I'm gonna have my book and then just gonna go with the challenge people pay 47 bucks for challenge
 I get a book for free and I'm taking this this live challenge experience and she did it and the first one crushed
 I think she's she'd over six figures and sales and she messes me
 She's like Russell I like I cracked the code like we've never had some hit like this before and she didn't four or five more
 Challenges to the year and she just barely passed to comic club and it was amazing
 So she's speaking at funnel hacking live about challenges
 But then she did challenges with some of her clients or students and other people and showed a bunch of other people and everyone who's in these challenges
 It's killing it, right?
 Then I saw Garrett White pops up with his challenge if you go to the Kings kit comm you see his challenge
 It was like a four-week challenge as well so I funnel hacked him
 I bought his challenge with the process and I called Garrett up
 I was like dude give me all your info give me the intality
 I picked his brain out who he's doing his and what he's what he saw and the pros and the cons and then
 Talk to Natasha talk to other people and I was like this is this is the future
 It's forced consumption content the biggest problem most of us have with our clients is not that
 The biggest problem is not that like we they like the stuff we're teaching isn't good
 The biggest problems they don't ever actually go through the stuff right how many of you guys have bought a course and it sits on the shelf
 Right, and you never read you never go through it or you know
 You bought the members area someday I'm gonna log in but you never do or you bought the book and it's sitting there right?
 The challenge is force force you to consume the stuff right so we launched our very first challenge and there's a 38 challenge
 And we had 7500 people sign up for this challenge. It was amazing is every single day. It's like they would give a video for me
 Talking about a strategy because from Julie walking the tactics how to apply that strategy and Stephen Lars from me on live and like
 Motivate him and push him and the yellow me get them to do the thing and happen every single day now for 30 days
 All the content disappeared and it's gone forever and you either took advantage of it or you didn't and and that was it and
 and
 It was amazing is because everyone who was disappearing for it because it was going away because it's like you
 You don't use it you lose it it force people to wake up and actually do the tasks and do the things and holy crap
 The weird thing happens someone actually does what you say they actually have success
 Okay, and so the challenge is like the best way to get a result for your end customer
 I think every business should have a challenge
 And so if you look at if you look at me over the next 12 months
 You will notice that we have one funnel way calm as the front end challenge
 But then it'll also become the back end of every friend of all of our books all of our things everything goes
 leads into the one fun way challenge and they go through this challenge with a chance actually
 Actually affect them actually given the result they want when they have the result then they stick and they do more and more with you
 The toss was to was telling me on hers the last day of her challenge his webinar where she sells her
 Her course and 80% of the people who complete the challenge by the course
 I think it's like 25% of all the challenge people who sent for the challenge by the course
 80% of those who complete the course 80% of people who are taking action every single day end up buying thing at the end
 Garrett White sells a $500 a month continuity end of his challenge
 He was getting like 25% of the men who signed up to join the $500 a month continuity like it's one of the best
 Ascension vehicles in the world and so
 Like I said, I think challenges
 Are huge I think it's the future. I think every business should be having one
 I know for us like that was kind of of all the funnels we roll out last year
 That was one that was like the most shockingly surprising to me and I was like oh man
 This is something we had to focus on and which is why January 2nd
 What the one follow challenge launched officially again and day one we have like 900 people sign up
 And I think we had two I think it's like a little less than two weeks before the challenge actually starts
 We'll probably end up with another five or six thousand people who signed up and we're gonna run it every other month
 throughout the whole year and
 It'll it'll be the fuel that changes people's lives and gets into want to ascend with us as a company
 So challenges number two so number one thing from the year was food is fuel and like focusing on the fuel up in my body
 Number two is running contests. All right number three. I did a whole podcast episode on the slow while ago
 But it was the big aha I had after going to this
 retreat with a bunch of really smart dudes and
 and
 The big aha I had was that you know, I had been an all-star like you know in in business
 I've been writing copy and designing funnels and doing all these things and
 I've been trying to build this team the problem is like is as an all-star. I wasn't like a good team player
 I was like, you know, my team would try to something like I messed up and I ripped out of their hands
 I would just go dunk the ball myself and try to get all the credit about how great it was right
 And it was realizing like if I wanted to grow like I can't go from a hundred million to a billion by me being a better all-star, right?
 like I
 Don't care how good you are Michael Jordan
 You know, there's only one Michael Jordan and I like they you can't get better
 You stop growing at a certain point and the only way to continue to grow is to shift from being an all-star to being a coach
 And that's been a really interesting transition for me. It hasn't been as easy as I thought
 But it's been really rewarding really fulfilling in fact
 Just our internal agency like when they had in the last quarter of the year
 They had two funnels do over a million dollars
 And so we gave all people on our team a two-com club award
 Because they were the ones executed not right like I get some initial vision strategy, but then they went and actually did it and I think for
 You know one of the biggest things this year for us was just really focusing more on
 Building our team and training our team and less of like me doing the thing and me stepping back and like not doing the thing
 But coaching the people who are doing it and it's hard is different. It's it's definitely
 It was definitely like a different a different skill set
 But super super important and I think for all these guys like as you grow from from yourself to a team
 To you wherever if you start up you want to grow to a million from million to ten ten to a hundred
 But really has to come back to you learning how to become a coach
 You beat an all-star you can't get past a certain level and I got pretty thing far
 You know we got you know 70 80 million dollars a year in sales with me trying to be the all-star
 But as we shifted to this this concept of coaching our team and having them be all be all-stars
 That's like when the growth started hitting again
 And I'm looking at that right now inside the development team with Todd and Ryan those guys
 They've done such a good job of not just coding everything
 It's like they build this team and there's processes in place and they've they become amazing coaches for these people and now
 Things move faster than these two because because of that so
 Transisting from all started coach was another big big one for me this year. So number one
 The field we put our body number two contest funnel number three transition from all start to coach
 I number four as I was doing this whole process of like coaching people
 And it's funny because like I've become mildly obsessed like personality profiling right like the disc test
 I love 16 personalities, which is you know version of my ribs? I love I love all these different things and I've been obsessed with them and learning them all but
 This is one like I maybe this is the test
 I don't know there's kind of a realization I had as I was working with people
 On my team and now that I understand I'm like oh my gosh. I look at things through a different lens
 But I realize there's like three tiers of how people
 people work and
 There's nothing bad about any of them. They're just different and
 I think before I thought that things were bad because like I thought one way and somebody else had a different way
 And I was like oh like they're bad. They're not doing a good job. It's like no no
 It's not it's not the case. There's just a different skill set
 And so the three levels and I'll kind of map these out for you the first one is
 There are people who strategically
 Figure stuff out right like they sit down like here's the strategy of how it works
 and you see this vision of like how these things work and they connect and you see the patterns and like here's the
 strategy about how something works, right?
 And and so that that's one type of person the second type of person is someone who's a manager, right? They're able to take
 This strategic vision and then they can plug people in and they can manage those people to go and do the actual thing
 Right and they really get the management of the process and management of the people and kind of plugging in the systems and doing all that kind of stuff
 And then the third tier is people actually do the work the doers right who actually go out there and they
 They go and implement the thing and again, I think for a long time. I was like, oh well
 You know strategic thinkers are the most important part or oh the managers are the most or maybe the doers or whatever
 but it's like all of them are so vitally important and
 If you're struggling out in your business my guess is that you're probably missing one of those
 You may be a great strategic person like you have this vision of where you want to go
 But you suck at managing people and you're not a doer and so you're flounder or you're doing it like some gives me a task
 I will do it. I will crush any task, but it's like it's just me doing it
 It's not a whole bunch of people come up good at managing and I don't really know what to do that someone tells me what to do, right?
 and
 Advice a versus so it's like it's understanding
 It's like for a team to be effective you have to have all of those and you know
 We spend a lot of time this you're working on org chart
 And it was interesting as we build org charts like there's this flow
 You know like looks like a big pyramid scheme right here
 CEO and moves down to this level in this level and and I used to always like I don't always kind of hate
 I'm like what's the guy in the bottom gonna think like oh like they're clear down here in this this branch and this tree
 It's like no no
 Like it doesn't matter where in the tree you are the tree like the whole whole org chart is essential for the success of the company
 Right like there's got people at the top of the thing who are strategic thinkers a lot of times they make more money
 Not all the time, but but there's a lot of value in strategic thinking right and then underneath the strategic thinkers
 Then you have this layer of managers who are managing people and down below there
 There's these doers who are doing doing the actual work and it's interesting
 I see a lot of times where we have we would have someone in our team who's a really good doer
 They're amazing program or amazing whatever once we were like oh man
 This guy's so amazing. Let's move them up the org chart
 Let's make them a manager and also put this person who's like a rock star do where we make them a manager
 It's like they they they they were so successful to do her
 But they suck as a manager like they don't have management skills where we bring up say hey like what do you think about this?
 Like strategically things are in there like I don't know and also they fail because we put them in a role where they're supposed to be
 strategically thinking it's like no you're not supposed to be strategically thinking your doers
 Go out there and actually do the thing and I think and I think you know
 I look at our org chart now
 It's like there's people who are who are doers who make more than the people who are managing them right and that's okay
 Because sometimes there's a doer who's insanely good at this thing like and they should make more than their manager
 You know I think my head always had this org chart where the you know as you go down and it's paid less and less and less
 It's not necessarily that way. It's it's understanding like the value of the the role what they're what they're doing is what they should be paid
 But a doer can get paid more than a strategic thinker. It's just it's a different it's a different level
 And so I think for me to really understand that's like okay
 There's strategic people there's management people and there's doer people understand those are three different personality types and skill sets and all are essential to you being successful
 Okay, and so what I would encourage all you guys do is sit back today and think okay like which one of those am I
 Am I a strategic thinker?
 Right kind of sit down from whiteboard map out of vision. This is what we're gonna do what's gonna look like and do it up
 And if you're not that's okay don't feel bad, but you need to get a strategic thinker on your team
 You need a partner or somebody who's gonna be that strategic thinker, right?
 The next question is like okay
 Am I a manager?
 Do I love managing people and processes and plugging things in place and make sure things working together?
 because if if
 If not like I'm not super like I've become adapted like I'm able to do that but I don't love that
 I'm so my favorite thing right I should not be spending my time there
 I need to find people a really good management like there's there's this process
 I was trying to manage over the last three or months and I just it never got done because like I'm not that good at management
 I just handed off to somebody and it'll probably be done in like an hour now
 Because that person that's their skill set they're amazing at managing and then doing right like
 like
 It's my role in the company like like in my dream job. I would just be a fun will build I'd be doing it all day long
 That's my favorite part of it
 Unfortunately for me and for the company I'm more valuable as a strategic thinker
 But man, I love doing it too, right?
 And so there's people my team like they just do it all day long they write copy or get it build funnels
 They can be designer like I'm like I always tell them how jealous I'm like
 I wish I could just be a doer just doing the thing that you're amazing at like that's the thing that for me like I
 Would love to do in fact my second
 We're actually after you know some some day if we ever sell click funnels
 I'm gonna come back and work for click funnels and just be a funnel builder like I would be my dream
 None of the stress of owning a company and all the fun of just building the funnels that'd be amazing
 And so just understanding that like there's a strategic thinkers there's managers and there's doers and being okay with like
 First off figure who you are and second off is like surrounding yourself with those types of people because they are all essential for you to be successful
 And so yeah
 That was another big aha had as we were as I was going to this coaching phase and building the teams out
 People I was super frustrated with until I realized like oh
 Whether I'm a strategic thinker. Why do I keep trying to give this person strategic thinking opportunities? They're amazing manager
 Let me get someone strategic to figure this out. You know build out the strategic vision head at the manager
 And they will run with it and they will make it amazing
 But like being upset at the manager because they're not sure she's thinking is wrong like I was in the wrong there
 Right or vice versa like you get the strategic thinker who's like like dream you up all the ideas and we're like
 Hey go go manage like make it happen like I don't manage and we're angry at them
 It's like no like like that's what they are like it's a superpower each
 These are superpowers like understand that and coordinate people in the right spot your strategic thinkers and then
 To cast the vision the managers to set the processes and the doers to go and execute on the work
 And all three working in synergy. That's when you get magic happening. All right, so number one we talked about was fuel number two contest
 Funnels number three transition all started courts to coach number four
 Understanding to pursue strategic thinkers managers and doers and how they all fit your organization and then the number five thing that
 Was called by my my last biggest takeaway for this year?
 is
 As we're growing click funnels, I feel bad. How many you guys like when you open a Facebook or Instagram?
 All you see is my face like eight thousand times a day. I'm so sorry for that
 But for a long time like I'm I've been the attractive character of click funnels there for my faces out there
 You know like all those things and so it's like that's what's out there
 It's like eventually it gets so saturated you can't keep growing with your one face your one brand your one thing
 You know at a hundred million dollars, you know at a million dollars is easy to keep pushing and getting your face out there at a hundred million
 It's like man. We're spending millions of dollars a month like
 On my face like there's so many people in this world like it gets insane
 So I was like how do I how do I do this and also like let's say we did want to sell click phones from there
 I'll say I wanted to retire whatever like if my face is on the front of everything
 It's not a very good asset for somebody else to buy right and so the she restarted like
 Having this idea like you what are the other front ends we create for click phones that aren't
 Russell Brunson's face
 Okay, so that was the question that was the the kind of the concept and you will notice over the next 12 months instead of our company
 All the new things that are happening
 We tested a couple like one of them we had Kaylin Poland who just had her baby yesterday by the way
 She did a webinar she had kind of my final high-school webinar
 But she did her version of it and that's done amazing well
 So great and it's like people are here in Kaylin's story and they come to click phones
 I don't even know who I am which is fantastic right so that's like that's one
 That's one example
 So I can't I can't tell details about it yet, but
 We are in the process right now which send letters of intent of acquiring a really large company
 And the sole reason why we're doing that because it gives me the ability to create
 Dozens and dozens of front ends that aren't Russell that aren't my face right?
 That will lead people to click funnels, but they aren't my face
 Which is essential right?
 So you guys will find out probably the end of quarter one
 Maybe early quarter to you about that acquisition as long as it goes through it should and I'll talk more about it in the strategy behind it
 because it's so exciting, but I just it's like
 It's like we have a letter in 10th sign, but the deal is not like E. So I can wait on that one another partnership where I'm doing work
 Again, all these all the deals and the partisan things I'm doing right now
 We're all about like how is it like how can this be a front end? It doesn't require Russell Brunson's face
 And so if you want to start thinking the same thing like what other front ends you create for your business
 There aren't always you focused on a success story like most of our ads that we're developing now
 We're capturing success stories of our users like our users are becoming the face of click funnel users are becoming the front ends
 It's not just
 Excuse me not just Russell not just his books not just his things right?
 It's the users are the ads and then it's we're getting influencers making funny videos with influencers as ads
 We're creating new software programs
 That aren't just built in the click phones because we're building these tools
 externally
 Where we can sell to bring people on the back and in the click phones
 right?
 So we're just building all these these funnels things front end things aren't mean because if you see 22 Russell ads in row
 You know you're likely to buying goes down every single ad right because either you bought or you're really annoyed with me
 Right, but if you see an ad for for me and they see an ad from Tony Robbins
 You see an ad from these other things that aren't related, but they all push back to the same core thing
 There's magic there. So you'll see this next year will be the year of a lot of funnels for our team. We're building our agency
 Really large we're doing it with with the goal to focus if it's not Russell funnels
 Couple actually I'll give you a couple examples the wheels and you had spinning like for example
 Grant Cardone we went and built a book funnel for him with the first ten X book right?
 We flew on his plane and I filled in the whole the whole funnel there and so if you look at that book funnel if you go and you buy it
 if you buy
 You buy the book through it on the thank you page then
 Basically it pushes people into click fun. So so now we can target Grant and his audience his people
 He pays the ad dollars to sell his book and thank you page it sells click funnels and then we send a
 percentage of this you know affiliate commissions back to him so it's a win-win where
 You know we're able to help him drive traffic and sell a lot of books which then in turn sells click funnels, right?
 We're trying to same deal with Robert key sock game potentially other other people as well where it's like we're helping them on the front and funnels
 And then exchange we get customers on the back end like how many deals are there like that you can create where it's like
 I'm not necessarily the front. I'm able to leverage all these other people
 So now in the news for you see Russell's face sell my book
 You see Tony Robbins book you see Grant Cardone's book you see who else's books right you see those things and you buy them
 And it's like on the back end you're in Houston click funnels and now it's like I can I can acquire a lot more customers a lot different type of customers
 To that process. So anyway, there's kind of a vague way to explain it
 You'll see that that is my strategic vision for the year
 And you'll see it coming true over next 12 months and next year when we're doing the same podcast you think oh, that's what he's talking about so cool
 I see it all fits together
 All right, so those are the five biggest things and I was going through my list today
 Just think of the biggest takeaways from the from the year. I think it helped you guys. Number one is
 Looking at food food is fuel. How are you feeling your body and knowing that right now Russell spends a hundred dollars a day on supplements for those body
 Like what can you do different?
 Maybe you don't eat cereal for breakfast. Maybe you cereal for dinner when you're ready to go to bed
 But you may eat eggs for breakfast or you eat key tones for breakfast or you skip breakfast altogether to keep your energy high
 Right so fuels number one number two is
 The power of challenge funnels and contest funnels if you want to see ours in action go to one funnel way calm
 But this is now the core front into all of our businesses all of our books
 Everything will lead to this and this leads and sends people of our value ladder number three my personal role transitioning from the all-star
 My team to transitioning to a coach
 I think for all of you as the faster you can make that transition from all sort of coach the faster you can grow and start scaling your companies
 Number four is understanding the different types of thinkers the strategic thinkers the managers and the doers
 Understanding that all three of these roles are essential for success in your company and you got to figure out who you are and surround yourself
 So with the others and then number five creating different front ends for your company that aren't just you
 So there you go. There's five big things
 For my for my year my guess is mostly listening to this
 Only one or two listings will actually
 Resinate with you right now. It's totally cool. So me as a spot
 We have one friend in working let alone a whole bunch of other front ends
 So don't even worry about that doubt but some you guys like you're tired and you try to get stuff done
 You can't focus and it's like now the fuel you're putting your body is destroying your ability to compete
 Right, so it's like fixing your fuel as your big singer
 It's like maybe have a funnel but it's not going that way
 We have maybe I make a contest funnel in the front like each of their guys
 Hopefully there's something you can pick from it that'll benefit you specifically
 and
 And maybe check out this podcast to get a year from now and then some of those ones may pop out for you
 Anyway, hopefully that helps you guys appreciate you all thanks for listening
 And with that said I will talk to you as all again very rich and everybody
