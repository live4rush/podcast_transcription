 Hey, what's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast. I'm back in the Napoleon Hill room
 And today I want to talk about one of the keys to successfully selling your own information products
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, so I've been hardcore binge listening on Dan Kennedy because you know what every month
 I get a two-hour call with him to ask many questions
 I want and then from those calls we turn it into the magnetic marketing newsletter
 Which hopefully you guys are all subscribed if not you are crazy and you must hate money
 Or you just didn't know about it. So if you didn't know about it
 This is your chance go to know B.S. Letter calm and go get subscribed
 But anyway, I interviewed to interview him for two hours and then I take that and I literally myself
 Turn these things into an entire newsletter
 Each newsletter takes me more in a day, which is eight hours times my daily rate, which is like 80 grand
 Eight hours 10 yes, I mean 80 90 grand worth of my time goes into each issue and there's two months
 So if you look at like the value of those newsletters it are they're insane
 So first off make sure you stop everything and go and get those and that way you're getting you know two days of Russell's time each month to serve you
 Because I'm literally putting the best things we have in there
 And each month or something like super powerfully can take you can implement and should help you a lot
 So anyway, there's the pitch, but the reason why I bring that up is because
 tomorrow's my collie at two more two
 Two hours with Dan so one of my hours and talking specifically a lot about entrepreneurs and becoming a prime mover
 And like the mindset and the shifts and things you have to make to be successful as an entrepreneur
 Which is exciting and then number two I'm talking more about the information marketing business
 Which is something I couldn't do before I got into Dan Kennedy's world
 Like I was selling information on how to sell potato guns, you know
 I had to make potato guns and things like that
 But when I got into his world that was a big topic because most people who
 Like you see I know the lineage of where this whole game started like
 You know back in the day was Dan Kennedy and people and he was one of the first to really not not the first to do information
 marketing like selling information products like obviously people writing books for you know for thousands of years but
 The person who first I kind of formalized this it was interesting is when I got into that world
 What I saw was not so much just like people like how to make potato gun, but they were people who were
 Taking specifically Dan Kennedy principles, but into other markets
 Which is why I think you call the information marketing right like how do we how do we teach other people how to market their businesses and
 What he did strategically over the years was really cool
 So he built a whole bunch of little mini Dan Kennedy's in every market
 I don't know if you did this knowingly or not knowingly, but it was really powerful and really strategic and so
 He would have all these people come to his events
 You know like for example Bill Glaser owned men's wear store and then someone else owned an auto parts dealerships
 And also was a dentist in the chiropractor
 And so the first phase he would do with people's he would help them to market their businesses more effectively and more efficiently
 And so I was like if you look at like the different runs of not the not their value ladder
 But strategically where they take their cost they were taking the customers through and I've seen facts and documentation Dan actually explained
 So this isn't just my imagination is actually like strategically thought through
 But the first phase was like help is this new business owners to market their businesses more effectively
 It's phase number one and then phase number two is then teach those people how to become information marketers teaching these processes to the other ones, right?
 So give examples Bill Glaser Bill Glaser
 owned men's wear like a men's I don't know it's called like men's wears
 Men's warehouse, but I think of it wasn't men's warehouse was like that kind of a store there
 I'm like men's clothes and stuff like that and so he went through the uncanny stuff. He then modeled it
 Built up his own marketing and blew it up and made money with it
 And then Bill's next step was becoming an information marketer to men's wears companies
 So he created information products and courses and seminars teaching other people with men's warehouse style businesses
 How to market their business and that's how Bill made all his money and then or a lot of his money and then from there
 He ended up buying your dance company and blah blah blah
 But then that was the pattern I saw it in the dental niche like some people that came there dentist came to Dan's world
 He came really get dentists and then Dan would go and
 Have you know they would go and then he'd sell them the next thing which is how to make info from info products
 and
 And then they were all going sell them for products to that market and so it was really anyway very strategic very cool
 Very exciting
 Anyway, I share that because
 I'm looking at that next
 Hey, do you or may using June's issues will be very specifically about that
 But how do you take these skills that you're learning and how do you turn those into business, right?
 Like how do you start your own information businesses?
 And I was looking through like just all the people inside the ClickFunnels community and we've got thousands of examples
 One of them there's a guy's a mentor circle hidden he
 He started a hot dog cart and you know
 He made a bunch of my hot dog cart and then he started creating information products
 He's teaching people how to do their hot dog cart and he killed it as well like it's just really interesting and so
 for those years we have a traditional business like
 It's interesting because I was like I
 Don't say it mean they've always teased like people have like more traditional businesses like oh like that's so hard because
 You know like your traditional business is hard because like you can't sell to the masses in the world
 You're selling people in your local area, but the reality is like you can sell to people in your local area
 And then you make an information business teaching this principles these concepts and you can sell that to all the people in your industry around the world
 Chad Wollner another one of my good friends who's a chiropractor. He's the same things he came into my world
 but we taught him how to
 How to grow his in a lot of I taught him but like he looked at the principles and he figured out ways to use these principles to grow his chiropractic business and
 then
 He built his own frameworks and he's like that and he went out there and he he went and did further business
 It's like it's really really cool. Anyway, I digress the point I was trying to make
 via this podcast was from something I was listening to inside of Dan's one of dad's courses, which is like the fast path to
 info product creations, but one of the principles was interesting is
 They said to be successful in your own information marketing business a couple things you have to understand
 The other one thing is like what is it that you are doing to your competitor is not?
 Okay, so if you're a dentist and there's five thousand of dentists like what are you doing that your competitors not?
 Okay
 It could be like they either they cannot or they will not or it's proprietary to use your own system your own framework or whatever like
 But what are they what are you doing your competitors do not do and then your job is to clearly communicate that they can only get that from your business
 Like that's the secret right so again your hot dog cart dude
 You're the chiropractor the dentist you have the whatever and you're having success in your business
 For you to be able to turn then to successful information business
 That is the question is like what are you doing that your competitors?
 Do not and again cannot will not or it's proprietary to you if they're not able to
 And then how do you clear to the communicate that and that's a big secret?
 I had someone in our 2ccx and a coach call actually last week and it was fascinating like the call was very similar to that
 As I asked him like what do you do that's different than everybody else and he struggled
 He's like well, I do whatever else does I just do better like okay
 Well, you gotta figure out something proprietary that's different that's unique that's your own like that's the big secret here
 Right, that's how you get people to give you money is like your proprietary thing
 Your thing that's different than being able to clearly communicate that right like
 Like the my world when everyone first came into the funnel world like we explained our proprietary things these things all funnels people freak it out
 I was like oh but like only way to really do that is by having our click on software
 And then here's the books that teach it like this is our proprietary framework say that was the big the big secret anyway
 super cool super fascinating
 Yeah, now I'm throwing this out as a question because I've been thinking about this weekend
 I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it or not
 But I would love to hear your guys feedback if you'd be excited to
 And I did this because Dan was talking about something he did he said when he started doing this and training people
 He would make co-authored things where someone could take
 Dan Kennedy's work into the dental space and be co-authored with Dan and take Dan's principles and be able to share them right like right now
 You know legally my frameworks and stuff my frameworks and the people share them and unfortunately they do but like you know
 They're breaking the law like legally
 Not be you know they shouldn't be
 Able to do you know just to bail to take my doodles take my things and teach them
 But a lot of people do and I don't freak out too much because like it's passing on a message and stuff
 But would you be interested just put this out there?
 And I'm not committed in this yet. So this is not like I'm doing this or seating
 I'm just kind of more curious, but if I was to write another book
 That specifically would be a book to be able to co-author with you guys. So for example, I think the book would be called marketing secrets
 Because that's obviously the brand the podcast the name find marketing secrets and I wrote
 Yeah, 75% the book and it was leveraging the core frameworks from all three dot-com expert traffic secrets like the core frameworks inside of those became marketing secrets
 and
 Then let you guys co-author with me where you could co-author for your market your niche
 You're whatever so like you could be marketing secrets for dentist marketing secrets for
 People in Boise, Idaho marking secrets for the music industry marketing secrets or whatever, right?
 Would you be interested in that because that would do it would give you the ability to co-author with me
 It levers off my credibility number one number two then it would give you the ability to like to take the frameworks
 There's I those books and teach them like you basically have a license to teach those things, you know, I mean
 Anyway, just curious throwing out there be kind of kind of a fun a fun idea
 We just something that once in the past and it sold really well
 But I freaked out kind of pulled it eventually because like I don't a hundred people other co-author you booked me
 But same time like I would love to figure out more ways to get this message like marketing secrets and funnels and all those kind of things
 Into the hands of more markets where you guys would be able to penetrate different markets than I ever could and so
 Anyway, I'm just throwing out there
 I may be interested or maybe we'll end do something like that and just want to see if you guys are if you are
 Hit me up on Facebook or Instagram or whatever and just be like, yes Russell marketing secrets co-author
