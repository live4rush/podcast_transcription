 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing seekers podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 I want to share some today
 And to me as I've been thinking Russell this is a marketing podcast why are you talking about God and it's like because he has to do everything
 It's really important and bless my learn this weekend
 Has to with God, but it also then relates back to you guys in your market and so I think it's really really important
 So I was in Utah and I was meeting I had a meeting with
 someone who is one of the top leaders in in my church in them in the Mormon church and
 We believe in our church that there's a profit in this world of apostles similar to how when Christ was on earth and my meeting
 was one of the 12 apostles which was really
 Huge honor and scary and exciting and all those things all wrapped into one
 And I had a chance to meet with him and so this whole week prior leading up to it
 You know I've had a lot of thoughts about just life and how things work and then obviously meeting with him and afterwards
 and just it was really neat reflection time and
 And there's something that came out. I mean there's a lot of stuff
 I wish I could share in the context of this podcast, but it's probably not appropriate or the right spot
 And so I won't but there was one thing that's kept ringing through my head
 That I wanted to share because I think it's an important and it does relate back to marketing
 So there you go. Is that right if I remember related back to marketing talk about God for a few minutes. Hopefully that's okay
 So it's interesting is
 If you look at the world what the world tries to do is that they see kind of like and I don't want to get political
 Because I don't care about politics at all
 So I'm not gonna get political, but I see this most like it's amplified in politics
 Right where it's like these are the agenda items you want to be really a little believe this
 They believe this and they fight back and forth and who's right who's wrong all sorts of stuff like that, right?
 And it's kind of crazy and it's been interesting as I've you know my wife and I'm not perfect this by any stretch like it's
 Right aspire to be
 But when I look at an issue right look at something it shouldn't be like what do I believe like what is Russell believe on this topic?
 It should be
 Okay, I believe in a God
 So what does God actually believe on this topic and then my job as a human here is not to try to like convince God
 But like no no no no no you're wrong right because he's not so my goal is to look at like what he believes on the topic and
 Then bend my will towards that and so okay. This is what he believes therefore
 This is what I believe and that's that's how it should be if you do believe in an all-powerful creator who created heavens and earth and everything
 I think that we should like bend our will towards him. Okay, this is what he thinks therefore
 This is what I think on any topic. So it's like you know like I think that's it's important
 We're trying to set up our beliefs and we you know what we're for and for Gantz
 Those kind of things like it should be less of like this is my penis. I think is right
 So I studied right read and she'd be like
 What does God actually think and then sit back and pray and find out he believes and then be cool?
 I will make I will align my will with years
 I'll align with that because that's what you believe and so I was thinking about that and again
 Again, I something I probably would normally share inside the podcast
 But I started thinking about this from the business standpoint too because there's always correlations between
 All things right, and it's funny because a lot of the entrepreneurs that I work with
 It's interesting like what they what they do is they have an idea right?
 This is this product I want to create is the crazy in the world it's gonna change the mankind and I want to charge this price for it
 This I want to deliver it all they have all these things that they want to do because it's their idea
 Right, it's their baby and they go out there and they put out the market and the market crushes it
 It's like that idea sucks or that price points not right or whatever it is right in the market goes and and does its thing
 In the market in this situation is kind of like God like like the market doesn't care who you are
 Not that God and God does care, but the market doesn't care who you are right the market doesn't care
 What the market is what it is like you put your thing out there and it will tell you like that idea sucked or that it was amazing or whatever
 Like the thing in between there is right and so for our job as entrepreneurs is not to try like convince the market that our ideas the best
 Our ideas to find like what does the market actually want and then align our will with that?
 And when you do that that's when things explode right?
 That's like when we test funnels like we'll test and like oh the market said no
 We try it again and we tested tweak the messaging and the pricing we keep moving things around to a figure like
 What does the market actually want like what are they like how much they want to spend for this?
 What's the price like what do they actually want they even want this product?
 What are my ideas?
 They didn't want like is grave and ideas
 I thought they were the market did not care about it and the market is is the only thing that actually matters
 And so like I always tell people like drives me crazy people in in my coaching programs and Facebook groups and everything they'll come in and
 They'll be like hey, what's the like what's your opinion on this?
 I'm like, you don't take my opinion on it like I don't even trust me on opinion on my own stuff
 I let the market decide I create the thing the best I know how to do based on what I've seen the market respond to in the past
 I've make that thing and then I send some traffic to it and I let the market vote
 And I don't let the market vote through quizzes or surveys or things like that
 We're like oh, yeah
 I would buy that the only thing that I care about is people to actually pull their wallet out of their pocket and swipe a credit card
 That is how the market votes. They don't vote with their mouth. They vote with their credit card. Anyway, that's that's how it works
 So for for you guys and entrepreneurs
 It's important for you not to get so caught up on your ideas and what you believe
 It is important to figure out what the market actually wants what they actually believe
 They believe this is worth this amount of money
 They believe that this is what they want to buy like you figure out what the market actually wants and you do that you become rich
 Right if you fight against that you struggle and I've seen people go years sometimes decades and never have success because they
 They are trying to jam their beliefs down the market's throat and the market doesn't care about you
 All the market wants is what it wants and so you have to figure out what it wants and then you align your will with that
 And that's it
 And so as I was thinking about this we can with the with God and with you know our
 Our responsibility not so much to try to dictate what we believe and try to shove it down his throat
 But to figure out what he believes and then and then align our wills with him
 It's the same thing with the market and I want you to understand that that's when business becomes a lot easier
 Okay, it comes back to expert secrets 101 like page 3 or whatever like find a hot market ask me
 They want and then give it to him. Okay does not say find a hot market
 Decide what you think would be awesome to create and then jam it down their throats like that is a hard business to run
 Okay, it's the opposite way find a hot market ask me they want and then give it to them
 That's it in the market will tell you so
 Market will tell you if you're right mark will tell you if you're wrong and if you're wrong don't be mad about it
 Just change your approach change the price and change the hook change the angle change the product change the service
 Create what it wants and then everything else will take place that you need it to so there you go
 Is that okay if I we were religion into this thing?
 You guys don't believe in God. It doesn't mean he's not there
 Like that's what's interesting like sometimes people friends like I don't believe in God you should talk about like whether you believe in him or not
 He's still there like that's the interesting thing like you I don't believe that this will sell like whether you believe it or not
 It doesn't really matters with the market believes so let's go find out what the truth is and some liner beliefs with that
 That's in all aspects of life. So there you go. That's a creature Brunson preaching on hope you guys remind
 But regardless hope you got something out of that one and hope you guys understand that
 That's how the world works how the market works and we understand that and you line your will towards it
 That's how your girl company find a hot market ask me they want to give it to them. All right guys
 I'm at the office. I gotta go. See you guys all soon. Bye everybody
