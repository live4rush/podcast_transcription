 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast
 I'm getting in my car right now. So I almost want to say welcome to the mark in your car podcast
 Which for all my OG listeners know that was the original name of this podcast
 But since we are still in 2020 and the podcast is still called marketing your secrets or marketing secrets
 And welcome you's back to the marketing secret show
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out of the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody I'm excited you know when you have a lot of projects you have to do and there's like the ones you have to do
 the ones you want to do and
 For like half the time you spend going and doing the ones that you
 Want to do but then it's like you the point where you have to do the ones you have to do and you don't want to do it
 But you got to do it
 That's what I've been after last week is like there was this big huge project
 I did not want to do but I had to do and it's like the time was up and
 Just killing me to get it done and finally yesterday. I got it done
 Which means today I get your stuff. I want to do so I'm in good mood leave in the house
 into the office pumped for
 Pump for for the day and got so many fun things we were working on which is good. So I'm really excited for that and
 But today I want to talk to you about something interesting so
 Dave Woodward who is one of my partners in crime click funnels
 He is now the acting CEO of click funnels and he is amazing at it
 In hindsight, I should have made him the CEO of click funnels like five years ago, but I
 Repented my ways and he's doing it now and doing a much better job than I ever did
 Which is cool, which is giving me the ability to work on the stuff that I'm actually good at
 any who
 He came in yesterday and he told me he had this realization
 Which was one of these like boom aha's in my mind too that I just had to share with you because it's so good
 So you know I always talk about like you have to go publish every day
 So you can find your voice publish every day to find your voice publish every day to find your voice and Dave has been doing that
 Dave is probably one of the best students of every day as they does whatever I say, which is awesome
 and
 He said you know, I've been publishing for years and doing Facebook lives and podcasts and other than all these things
 it's like I still feel like I'm in my rhythm and
 He told me this fascinating conversation. He said he was hanging out with his son Parker and
 Parker has been
 Has been teaching people how to start podcast and that's been his like his framework is teaching people how to start on podcast and things like that
 And Dave said to Parker like he's like hey
 I'm struggling because I he doing this and I just don't like I'm getting much traction
 I'm still trying to find my voice trying to find my voice when Parker said and again. This is like wisdom beyond his years
 Parker said dad you don't need to find your voice you need to find your framework and then your voice will come easy and
 It's like boom
 And all of a sudden I was like I need to go back and edit the expert secrets book and edit like all my podcasts and everything because he's right
 Publishing to publish doesn't I mean?
 It'll eventually get traction
 But I didn't understand this because for me
 I started with frameworks right had these frameworks and start publishing so I was talking about the frameworks and that's how my companies grew
 But if you don't have a framework, you're just talking
 It's harder to get that traction until you have a framework
 They don't even framework you start talking around the framework and then that's when you start getting traction and it was just like this
 Aha that I wish I would have had a long time ago because it would help me so much as I'm coaching and teaching people
 And so the concept is not so much like keep publishing till you find your voice. It's
 What is your framework like if your framework is like for Parker's like here's my framework for launching a successful podcast for me
 It's like here's my framework for a funnel or for a story or for like a bajillion things right like I've got way too many frameworks
 But you know I mean like and so when I'm publishing I'm talking around this framework
 I'm talking telling stories about this and this and this and this and this all things leading back to your core framework
 Right Stu McLaren teaches membership sites like that's his framework
 You know and so everything he's talking and publishing all somehow leads back to that for me. It's funnels for
 Who else there's a million people like
 Rachel Peterson, right? She's teaching social media management
 It's like when she's publishing teaching and talking she's pushing people all towards towards that framework that she teaches that she helps people with
 and
 That way all the publishing all the stories all the things are compounding upon one
 focal point which is your frameworks and
 Yeah, when Dave told me that I was just like oh my gosh like this is this is huge
 So I want to kind of amend everything I've told you guys in the past about publishing and if you talk about
 You know finding your voice and putting things out there and keep talking you talking keep talking
 But I want you now to think about it through the framework of or through the lens of what is your framework, right?
 What is the core framework that you teach or you talk about you know
 Is it a way to to build your relationship way to make money or a trade stocks a way to lose weight a way to?
 Make build a potato gun a way to get better at wrestling you better jujitsu
 Like what is your framework and then all your stories wrap into that like like amplifying?
 testifying teaching training sharing
 Sharing different angles different different different setups like all the things you do to get people to have success with that framework
 if that makes sense and so
 Anyway, that's that's what I want to share with you
 Because I think that that's such a small but powerful distinction. So it's not just publishing to find your voice. It's
 It's it's publishing
 To fight it's finding your framework and then and then building your voice around that framework, right?
 Like that's that's the the the the intricacies. That's the the tweak the change
 That I think is so powerful. So first off Parker Woodward. Thank you for bringing it today's attention day
 Thank you for my attention and now I want to bring that to your head's attention as well as you are
 Publishing it's not just publishing to find your voice
 It's figuring out what's your framework and then publishing around that right?
 You're gonna find your voice in relation to your framework on that way. There's a focal point like so I'm just talking to talk
 It's talking to push to a very certain
 Concrete framework you're teaching you're talking about that you're helping people with and when you do that
 That's what now starts amplifying your message
 That's where you start doubling down and getting better and better because your stories are all leading the same framework your your examples your
 Like all the things you're doing are leading back to that like for example this episode right now, right?
 Like I have my framework for how to teach frameworks have my framework for how to build your framework right?
 Those are things happening. So this is just
 This is an episode where I'm podcasting and I'm talking about this little intricacy as it leads back to my framework
 About frameworks right if you've read the expert secrets book then you know
 that
 That it's it's you know one of my frameworks and and it's and like this is
 Leading back to that so if you haven't read the expert secrets book especially the new updated hardbound version
 Which is a million times better than the original I go deep into frameworks and things like that
 And this is like a little intricacy a little tweak that I would love to add on it
 So I'm able to podcast and share this thing with you
 But it's all tied back to a core framework that I teach therefore amplifies my message as opposed to being just like a random
 Story in the ether right or whatever you call it. So anyway, hope that helps
 So a question for you is what is your framework now after you figure out?
 This is my framework my framework because my seven-step process to blow out my whatever my perfect webinar my whatever your thing is right
 And here's all the things you can do to publish and talk and share
 To find your voice in relation to that framework that would people do find you
 They're gonna know where to go because there's an outlet for them to get more of the thing that you are sharing and talking about
 So with that said hope that helps appreciate you all I'm gonna go in and have an amazing day today
 Because I can work on what I want to work on yeah
