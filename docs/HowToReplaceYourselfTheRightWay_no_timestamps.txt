 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to
 marking seekers podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 Everyone I just got done I took off early today and went and took Nora to little Jim
 Which is so stinking the funds you so cute and I had him back to the office to go get some stuff done
 Just grateful today for being an entrepreneur and having the ability just to like take off and go to my daughter's little
 Jim thing and have fun with her and not have to like worry about anything so
 One of the one of the hidden benefits of being an entrepreneur right all right so I want to talk to you today so
 It's something that we have been talking about a lot recently probably because we're in the middle of it in our company
 but it's like
 Getting the systemization in right so the first time I ever heard about systems was I read the book
 Emith Michael Gerber and I I remember
 It was probably like 12 years ago or something and at the time
 I started my business and I had like learned how to do everything right because I didn't have any money
 Outside of a program. I never learned program
 so hired this guy named adorable in a romaine who still works for me this day and
 So he did all the programming stuff
 I had to figure everything else because I didn't have any skills I had to learn how to do right copy
 I had to learn how to I didn't even just either hired it just but I learned all these different pieces led to marketing and traffic and sales like and
 Like it sucks when you first get started because it's just you you don't have any capital or money
 So it's like you have to like get really talented
 And I think that's one of the big reasons why if you heard the intro the show
 I make fun of people who take on VC money because I feel like they don't have to learn any of the stuff
 They just like cheat they get a bunch of money to hire people and there's never anyone on the team
 That actually is the skill set to run the show like there's got to be someone
 Who has done everything once?
 Or else it's hard to like I don't know. That's just my thought thoughts my feelings
 So I was doing everything from writing copy doing customer support driving traffic doing sales
 Project management everything was just me right
 And Dorel and then
 Someone I think it was Toman Knudson or someone at an event mentioned this book called the e-meth
 And I thought oh, it's like internet market. He was like internet or
 Email I don't know so I bought them so I remember we're going on a trip down to Lake Powell my wife and I
 And so we're heading out we swing by Barnes and Noble. I go in the bookstore business section
 There's a book called the e-meth. I'm like this is the one that I'll talk about so I bought it
 Jump in the car ride drive, you know 12 hours down the lake pal Utah
 Jump on a house book in the middle of the boat pull out my new book to learn by internet marketing and
 I start reading it has nothing to do with internet marketing
 I was kind of disappointed at first, but I know that was to read so I keep brand this thing and it was all about
 Systemization talked about
 You know how most entrepreneurs feel like they're juggling this thing and this thing and they're juggling at 10 different plates, right?
 You're trying to keep mall hole up top because you know if one of them falls a whole thing's gonna collapse
 You talked about basically going in there and like
 each of these things you're spinning it's like create a system around it plug some of that system and then and then run with it
 and doing that through all the different things until eventually about saying systemized and
 That was kind of the gist and I've never gone super deep with Michael Grover stuff outside of that and I have a couple friends who disagree with
 what he says, but the conception is like this is brilliant like build systems to replace the things that I'm doing and
 And I honestly struggled with that for a long time. I think most entrepreneurs do because I
 Think this and this is this is the whole point of this podcast. I think I know why now that we're doing it the right way
 I think the reason why is because
 Because you have been you as the entrepreneur who had to figure out all this crap ahead of time
 You had to figure out do all these things like you're taking on like 20 or 30 different skill sets initially
 You have to learn to be able to launch a business, right?
 Which is hard and some things you're really good at some things you are horrible
 but you had to figure out to do it because
 Because there's no one else doing it right like I had to learn how to write copies
 I remember someone explained it to me in time. I was like, oh, that sounds horrible like I hate writing and then I go well
 You could hire them, but they're really expensive and I didn't know how to hire
 So I went and only person I really knew at the time who who considered themselves a copywriter was Joe Vitaly
 And I went to his site and he was charging like you're like
 $6 a word for email copy. I was like six dollars a word like even the little words like uh, and uh, and I was like I
 Guess I gotta learn this crap
 So to buy books and study and practice and read and learn and like it was painful
 But I had to do it because there's no one else that could do it at the time, right?
 So then we get this point where we're starting to systemize things and we start bringing people in and I think the biggest problem
 most of us have as we assume that the people that we're bringing in
 will have all the skills that we've acquired to get this thing off the ground and
 I
 Think that's what I've always been frustrated. I can bring people in and I'm like God like you can't do this like
 Yeah, you're gonna get this one part, but you're horrible all these other things and it's like you try
 We try to find rock stars to replace us which is like not easy at all
 And what I've been learning through this new process is systemization my doing with James P
 James P. Frill
 Is it's less about that more like
 figuring out all the pieces
 And then bringing people that are just amazing at that one piece and so it's gonna be weird. It's like I
 Don't say this the right way because I don't want to make it sound offensive because it's not even a little bit
 I feel like for me and for most entrepreneurs like we probably get to like level
 Six or seven skill set and a whole bunch of things right that gets this that gets this idea off the ground
 Right, and so that's kind of that's kind of where we're at and the goal is not to bring in someone
 That's the same thing. It's like it's like picking each one of those skill sets that you're six that you take that apart
 And you find 10 level person and plug them into just that one thing
 And so the problem with that in our minds entrepreneurs
 I know how we all think is like she's saying is they can people replace what I'm already doing and it's like we yes
 But those 10 people will be able to do level 10 of what you're doing not level four
 You know five or six whatever you're doing right now
 And so it actually becomes better
 But it takes more people to do it because there's not anyone who's gonna write copy end-to-customer support, right?
 Even though you had to do that like they they're not gonna do it
 You got to find like the level 10 support person level 10 copy person and level 10 funnel person and level 10 designer like all those pieces
 You plug them in and and be okay with the fact that they're not gonna do all the stuff you did
 They're just gonna do that one piece, but they're gonna do way better than you
 And
 And if you try to give them two things or three things they're gonna suck at all of it and they're gonna be way worse
 You're gonna get frustrated annoyed and fired them, right?
 But it's like understanding that they're like their level 10 skill set is gonna replace your six and now you get 10 people and all of them like
 Now it becomes magic and when looking at this happening now in our in my business
 I've always been I've had an amazing team and I've been building this team for a long time and it's been it's been good
 But as we're specifically trying to replace me out of things that I currently do which I
 Just I do a lot of things. I still do things
 And it's like I'm trying to not do that I pull myself out those pieces and it's like it's been scary
 but I'm trying to find the level 10 people each spot plug them in and now it's like man they take my like what I did and make
 a better and
 And I think that most of all computers probably level 10 in one thing like I think
 Yeah, like I would say I'm level 10 at one thing
 So I'm keeping that piece because I love it
 But the rest of it beginning of the people and anyway, I told that gives you hope because I know that
 As I systemized stuff in the past I'd always get frustrated because I think I would try to give people three or four things
 Like hey, you're gonna write copy and do this and do this and they can do one or two
 But then the other ones make it make them struggle and just they never were able to be rock stars that it was by fall
 I didn't let them shine
 whereas now stepping away from this and realizing what like
 Just how the folks on that one thing just because you did 10 doesn't mean they should be fact
 They do it's gonna hurt themselves and you and everyone like I think that's part of the problem part of them
 I guess the opportunity to entrepreneurship is that we have to master 10 things to get this thing into orbit
 As soon as you get that a million bucks now, it's like, okay now. I just bought my freedom now
 it's time to take this cash and replace myself with level 10 people and
 Yeah
 And first it's gonna be scary to spend all your cash on these level 10 people
 But if you get level 10 people then the cash will dramatically increase
 And if the cash does not dramatically increase means you didn't find the level 10s. So
 Anyway, I hope that helps it was kind of big off of me recently
 Just watching was like I want to go with Nora and I did a little meeting with my team
 I'm looking at like, okay
 That's the person who plays this part of me and that first place that part of me and that part of me
 I look at all the things and I'm like all of them are better those things than I am
 It's just so great
 I can go play with my daughter now and they're doing their their their piece of brilliance and I can go spend time with my daughter
 Pretty special pretty cool. That's that's the goal. That's been the goal for me
 I'm finally getting there and I hope that gives you guys some faith and some hope especially those who have tried to
 Systemize have tried to replace yourself and ever tried to hire people and have been frustrated
 I get it and maybe this little piece that I got over the last day or two will help you as well
 So hope that helps me back in there build some funnels. Thanks everybody and we'll talk to you soon. Bye
