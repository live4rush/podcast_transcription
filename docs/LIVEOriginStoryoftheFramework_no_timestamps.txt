 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back the marketing seekers podcast again
 This is episode number two from a recent marketing seekers live show
 I've been doing more of these podcasts live and having so much fun with it
 Hopefully enjoyed the last one we had a chance to hear some really cool marketing secrets from some of my friends
 this episode I'm actually going to
 Go deeper into something that that I've been geeking out on I've been thinking about that
 I think you are really really going to enjoy what I'm gonna cover in this episode is actually one of the big ahas
 I got from a recent event we ran as our first live event we've had in
 Man in a year and a half two years crazy and
 It was called the fat event the funnel hackathon event
 I share one of the big epiphanies that a lot of people had at the fat event if you want to get on our next marketing seekers live show
 And get your questions answered live and hang out with us
 Make sure to go to clubhouse with Russell calm go register for the clubhouse and you'll be notified the next time I go live
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, well, I'm excited
 Typically when I record the marketing seekers podcast is me on my phone clicking record and talking and that's gonna happen for the next 15 minutes or so
 It's just sharing you guys the biggest thing that's on my mind right now
 And so this week we actually did our very first live event since
 COVID which was amazing here in our office
 We have an event room that holds about 60 people and so we didn't event the event is called the fat event
 And it's not FH FAT like overweight people read donuts and stuff for two days
 It was the funnel hackathon so funnel hackathon FHA T so they all make name of the fat event and this is an event
 We used to do
 Four years ago was actually the very first fat event we ever did and it was helping people to figure out their messaging their story
 And then we actually built out a webinar presentation with everybody in the audience
 And we did it four years ago
 And if you've seen us at the ClickFunnels community some of the people who have had the biggest most successful webinars people then
 A lot of seven few eight and a couple of nine figure earners who were in that room at the time
 Who crafted their webinar that went on to build out their entire businesses and their fallings based on that and so we did it once and then we we ran
 versions of the fat event three or four times afterwards and then
 You know when things work really good like a lot of us business owners and marketers do we stopped doing it
 So we stopped doing it. I think I was tired of doing the live events
 we kind of just paused it and didn't do it for a couple years and
 Recently I got excited and I'd been working on webinars and frameworks and just things like that
 And I was like I want to do the fat event again
 And so we put it together we invited some of our inner circle and some of our two comma club
 ex-coaching students to come to it and we had about 60 people in the office here in Boise the last two days and then
 four or five hundred people watching from home and it was amazing was two days and it was cool because
 We had a chance we wasn't just like strategically teaching. Oh, here's the strategic concepts, but it was very tactical like okay
 Here's slide number one. Let me explain the strategy slide number one
 This is what we do why we do it how we do it and then everyone would jump in and they'd actually build out slide number one
 We do slide number two three and we build out the entire presentation. So it was cool when it was finished
 Everybody had a presentation that's done. They can go and they can actually use it to sell their stuff
 And so that was what's happening last two days
 So obviously this is what's been top of my mind and the last day the event we went around the room and had everyone share their
 biggest aha their biggest takeaway and
 what was interesting to me is that the
 The thing that came up the most often that was people's biggest aha
 Was something that that was kind of confused
 I didn't realize that it was gonna be that even that big of a deal and it was it was interesting
 So before I share with that is if you know how the perfect webinar framework works that we teach right when somebody comes on a webinar
 First we have an introduction from there
 We share the origin story about how we discovered our framework and then we have secret one two and three
 Secret number one you teach the strategy behind the framework
 Secret number two you teach the strategy behind the internal faults belief. They're gonna have about the framework
 secret number three you teach the the external faults belief about the
 Then they may have out their ability to use the framework and then you transition to the stack and the closes
 And that's kind of the perfect webinar framework
 Right if you don't know how it works if you go to perfect webinar calm seven bucks
 You can buy the the the framework and the training it shows you the process or read the expert secrets book
 I go into excruciating detail in that book walking through the process as well
 And so that's kind of a real quick overview of the framework for those who don't know what those who have gone through myself
 You understand how the framework works and the biggest takeaway people kept saying was fascinating was
 After they would introduce the webinar they transitioned to their origin story and what people were doing is they were just telling their origin story
 like here's how I became me right and they're telling their origin story and
 Even people who had really successful webinars that's they were doing and when I kind of rebrok it down
 Slide by slide. I showed them that it wasn't just the origin story of themselves that they're sharing
 Yet, that's what most people are doing. It's the origin story about how you discovered the framework that you're actually teaching on the webinar
 Right. So for example, if you watch the webinar that we use to launch click funnels
 The framework that I'm teaching is this framework of funnel hacking right of how we how we find successful funnels
 We look at them we reverse engineer and we build our own funnel like that's the framework that I'm teaching right?
 And so the framework they the origin story
 I'm sharing is not the origin story about you know
 I met my wife for the origin story about how I started business or like that's not the origin story
 I'm sharing it that seemed like for most of the people who were there they were they've been sharing their origin story
 Just about their life like like here's you know
 I was born on a cold winter night and bubble you know whatever like they're telling their story as opposed to it's the
 Specific story about how your discovery of the framework like how did you actually find that frame rate?
 That's the story that's being told right because when you do that that then
 Gives people the desire to go deeper on the framework
 And so when we're building out everyone's webinar the very first step
 We did it everyone is is this okay with this webinar there?
 There's there's a result you are promising. What is the result that everyone's if they go through this this 90 minute presentation?
 We with you. What's the result that they should be able to get right and so every business was different
 There's some people there in the weight loss market
 So I'm gonna show you how to get six pack abs how to make it how to make a million bucks or how to how to speed read or
 How to like you know whatever their person the result they had right and so we became super clear
 What's the result and the second question was like what are all of the things that people are currently doing to try to get that result?
 Right like if somebody's registering for your webinar is probably not the first time they think oh I want to lose weight
 Oh and make money right in fact Caleb Poland said that the average woman goes through eight eight diets a year
 So almost every month they're starting you die
 So when they come in the register for your weight loss webinar, this is not the first time
 They try to ton of it. They tried eight other vehicles this year to try to get that one result, right?
 And so that's the key is first of what's the bigger?
 What are your promising what are the other vehicles people are trying to use right now currently to get that result in this webinar is about
 What is the new opportunity? What's the new vehicle that you're trying to show them?
 And so that first origin story is literally telling your story about how you try these other vehicles to I try this I try this
 I know these things work and that's when this thing happened either I had an epiphany or I had an inspiration from God
 Or I met somebody and they gave me this this nugget this piece this thing
 Right and that's how I discovered this framework and this framework is a new opportunity
 It's a vehicle it's a different way to get that result than all the things you've tried in the past and this is how I found it
 How and why it worked right so that original that original story that first 15 minutes your presentation is you're telling that story of how you
 Discovered this framework, right?
 And that's the thing that gets the desire for them like okay
 Now I want to dive into secret one secret to secret three and moving through the stack and the clothes and the rest of the presentation
 And so again, there are probably four or five of the people in the room that that was their biggest takeaway was
 I always thought the origin story was just telling my story
 But it's not it's the origin story of how you discovered this framework this vehicle
 Whatever you want to call it the new opportunity that you were using to get someone the result that they've been trying to get to all the other
 You know things they've been trying in the past and when they discover that they hear your story about how you discovered all of a sudden
 It's like oh my gosh like now I now I get it now
 I now I got to figure this out because you're right
 I've tried all these other vehicles
 I've tried all these other ways to lose weight and to make money or to whatever right
 So you're sharing those and then this is discovery that I found that the new opportunity the thing is different and now
 They're like intrigued and now they're gonna go through the actual teaching part of your presentation
 So that's what I want to share with you guys is just understanding that that
 That the origin story is the the origin story of your discovery of the framework that you're gonna be showing with them during the presentation
 And so hopefully that helps and as you guys are creating your presentations again anything you're trying to sell
 In fact, I learned this originally from from Perry who was on a little bit earlier. He said that um
 I think is back when they who was running digital marketers
 Like they looked at all their old sales videos and their ads and stuff like that and anytime in an ad
 They tried to convince somebody more than one thing the conversions dropped in like half
 And they're like convinced of two things that dropped like a hundred percent right two or three hundred percent
 And so when you're creating your presentation the only thing you're trying to do is get somebody to believe that this framework
 You're sharing is the best way for them to get the result that they're trying to get like that's the entire goal of the presentation
 And so we understand that it's like okay, what is the result? I'm trying to get somebody
 Right what are the other things they've been trying to get and then this is the this is the key
 This is the framework that's gonna get in that result
 So that's what I shared with you guys today as you're crafting your sales presentations works for webinars works for video sales letters
 Works for upsell offers works for your ads works for everything you're doing
 It's like that framework that concept is the same right sharing the origin story about how you discovered the actual framework
