 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing
 skills podcast alright hopefully you enjoyed the last episode I gave you as
 one of the pre-training from the Brillouge Your Brand Challenge with me
 and Dean and Tony and today I'm gonna give you guys the second one that was
 funny this actually did this training at my in-laws house in front of a tree
 and the only spot in the yard I could get good enough internet to do it and
 while I was doing this just puts the perspective I had my son with a BB gun
 pretending to shoot me in the face right behind the camera in the middle of
 my pop socket popped off and one of my kids my 10 year old climbed up on the
 roof of the house and I'm doing a long long live and watching things in the
 background trying to now be distracted but in this we talked about the magic
 B-word what is that B-word where it's the one that's gonna determine whether
 you're successful or not and so I want to share this episode with you because
 again I think it'll shift your mindset it's one of our pre-training's we did for
 the Brillouge Your Brand Challenge I hope you enjoy it we'll cue up the theme
 song when we get back we'll jump right into that training
 so the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat
 and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets how do we
 market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things
 that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain profitable that is the
 question in this podcast we'll give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson
 and welcome to Marketing Secrets
 What's up everybody this is Russell and I'm starting here in a couple seconds
 so I jump on a quick and say hey to everybody how excited are you guys for
 the Brillouge Your Brand Challenge how excited are you for Monday it's coming
 very very soon and I hope that you're half as excited as as I am I know me
 Dean and Tony have been going crazy getting this ready for you guys and I'm
 a pumped spend some time yesterday we got 10 minutes for some pre-training you
 prep you ready you emotionally ready for this moment this time this like
 literally like a date with destiny over next week this gonna have the
 possibility of shifting everything for you so I'm actually on a family vacation
 right now last night after a long hard day we decided to jump in the car and
 drive a couple hours and come to a rodeo just like so much fun and now we're in
 law's house I'm in the front yard it's the only spot I could find that I could
 have internet to go live with you guys and I hope you forgive me then because
 you probably hear some lawn mowers in the background and kids running around
 and so I apologize in advance for that but I'm here because we've got 10 minutes
 of pre-training to go through and I want to get you guys excited so let me
 doubt first up before I get too deep into this we've got we've got different
 levels of people coming in here we've got people who are the dabblers who
 like I'm just checking out see what's happening I got those who are insane
 who are all in who are gonna go a million percent no matter what so I'm
 curious if you're a dabbler right dabbler down below if you're like I'm all in
 right I'm all in down below because I want to find out exactly who I'm hanging
 out with who I'm serving today because I don't deal well with dabblers as you
 probably nest I like hanging out with the people who are going all in all the
 time and so if that if that's you then down below let me know okay all right
 awesome okay we got a bunch of you guys coming in right now so as we're
 preparing this week you know next week we've got so much cool stuff prepared and
 lined up for you guys and Dean asked me ahead of time he's like hey if you were
 to talk to people before before the train starts to like to help them to
 get them inspired get them excited get them to break down the barriers anything
 is gonna hold them back from success what would you tell them and so we start
 talking to some topics and some ideas and one of the things that I wanted to
 share with you guys which is right in the first my first pre-training was
 talking about the transition from growth to contribution how many guys had a
 chance to watch that video me talking about growth the contribution okay I'm
 asking because since I've done that video like over 50,000 people registered
 for the challenge so tons you may have missed it so make sure you go back to
 the announcements and my biggest recommendation between now and when we go
 live on Monday is go watch all the pre-training like we design these things
 and structure them in a way to help break through false beliefs get you
 motivate you excited help you see the future help you see the vision where we're
 going what we're doing and so if you haven't go watch that okay or make sure
 you guys are watching that but my first thing I want to talk about was that
 transition from growth to contribution because that's everything that's why we
 do this that's like the why behind it for me and hopefully becomes the why
 behind it for you that contribution is the thing that's going to change your
 life more than anything you've done up to this point okay so that's the first
 part of it the second thing I want to talk about man the guy lot more in the
 lawn is getting closer and closer hopefully he runs out of gas soon the
 second thing I want to talk about is something that I call the magic B word
 okay if you saw the description magic be where so what is the B word and why
 you understand this because in my beliefs and my my understanding is that
 this thing if you understand this if you if you if you execute on this B word
 it'll give you the ability to have success in anything you do in life okay
 if you don't it'll guarantee you fail at anything in life okay now we might be
 what is that what is that thing okay and the B word that I want to talk about
 is simple and it's the word belief okay it's interesting I get people I've been
 doing this game now for 18 years this online marketing game you know a lot of
 it I've been doing teaching and coaching and stuff and I've seen in this much
 time a lot of commonalities what's interesting is that there's always people
 to come into anything we do right and they come in and they're skeptical so
 what is the skeptic skeptics coming who comes in and they want the result but
 they're skeptical which means they don't believe that you can give it to
 them right so they come in their skeptical looking around like and the
 whole time they look like like what's wrong where's the whole what's the gap
 what's broken what's the wrong thing right and they're they're looking for the
 problem the entire time okay and as they start looking for the problem guess
 what they always end up finding the problem the reason why they cannot be
 successful despite the fact that hundreds or thousands of people around them are
 having success they're able to say oh well Russell talks too fast so I can't I
 can't have success here oh like Russell Dean and Tony they sell something
 therefore that they got to have all two your motives they're not here to try to
 help me or and they ever got these different things right and it's like the
 skeptics never have success right ever in all things like this isn't just like
 in business this is in sports like I remember I'm a wrestler and so I was a
 wrestler growing up I remember we go to practice my coach would say something
 and I was just like I am here he's my coach so anything he said I just did and I
 had a few like well I tried that one time he didn't work oh well oh well I'm
 not very flexible or oh my arms are shorter I'm not that faster like they
 always have some excuse about why they couldn't do it they were skeptical they're
 always looking for the reason why they could fail because they want to be able
 to blame it on something as quick as humanly possible they don't want to take
 personal responsibility for it right okay and so if you don't come into this
 through the lens of belief I guarantee 100% that you will fail this process
 100% okay now if you someone who traditionally in your life is more
 skeptical it's gonna be tough for you okay and my guess is you've probably
 struggled a lot of things in life because you come in skeptical okay now
 this is all you understand when I first got into sports I remember my coach the
 guy who was my my coach I was like this is my coach he's amazing therefore
 anything he says I will believe no matter what even if it doesn't make any
 sense to me there's no logic there's no reason he tells me I'm gonna believe it
 and so remember coming in my coach is like you need to do this I'm like okay
 and he's they say this he tell me how to do a mover or what to do or whatever and
 whatever he said I just believed it with 100% certainly I was like like this is
 the coach this is the person who I got to be my coach therefore whatever he says
 I will just do I believe him 100% and as I did that guess what I became a better
 wrestler I didn't have excuse about why I was gonna fail why I wasn't good if
 why I wasn't talented like I could have been there's so many things right I saw
 so many people my teammates who fought every single thing right but I said okay
 okay I didn't talk back I didn't fight back I just I just believed okay and same
 things are transitioning into business I got into business I remember I started
 finding different coaches and mentors and I would join different groups I'd be
 part of stuff like this not this I've never been in part of a group is this
 big but I get involved and stuff I remember the the coach or the teacher
 whoever start teaching me something and I would watch as other people in the
 audience or the people who are in the Facebook or whatever who make well I heard
 so and so said this oh and now I was always different things I remember I was
 like dude I'm paying this person to tell me what to do therefore I'm gonna
 believe everything he says or she says whenever it is right and I just believe
 him right when I hire coach and the same thing I just like I just believe him
 and because of that I have success okay so the reason why I'm telling you is
 is because you came into this game right you came to this build a brand
 challenge and you said look there's three people who have had insane amounts of
 success you got Tony Robbins who arguably there's like probably no one on
 this earth has been more successful in so many things than Tony right you got
 Dean who's been doing this game for a long long time right Dean when I was in
 high school I used to watch a Dean on infomercials this is how much of a nerd
 I was I would watch his infomercials I record him on VHS and then re-watching
 I take notes on how he sold that's how that's how much of a geek that I was in
 high school right and I've been doing this game now for 18 years okay I know
 a lot of you know me yet we haven't met and we'll get to know each other a lot
 more over the next five days but I don't know a company called ClickFunnels and
 in the last five years we've helped we've helped over a thousand people making
 million dollars okay we've done this this is not our first rodeo right yeah
 there's so many people come into our world sorry there's the neighbors cars
 back those who missed it I met my in-laws right now we came to rodeo last night
 and I didn't have anywhere else to stream so Paul J. Seferni lawnmowers or
 people driving by or my kids going nuts anyway I remember the people are
 successful ones like all right I'm here you're the person I brought in my
 coach they're like how I believe I'm just gonna believe what I've been saying
 they just do it and they don't ever come back like oh I heard this or what
 about what if and I and like the different things and I promise you if you
 come into this challenge skeptical if you come in not believing it's 100%
 you're gonna keep it from having success if you come in like look I'm not gonna
 understand this stuff sometimes Russell's gonna talk too fast maybe like it's
 kind of like Mr. Miyagi like you remember Mr. Miyagi and Daniel Sun when
 he's like all right this is the deal Daniel Sun you want to learn how to
 fight this is what we're gonna do first thing you do is you come here and you're
 going to wax the car right wax on wax off wax on wax off and Daniel Sun's
 like all right starts waxing like no no no no grab your hand wax on wax off and
 you know and Daniel Sun's kind of like all right so he starts waxing and
 eventually wax is like 30 cars right it comes back is like all right Mr. Miyagi
 I'm ready to learn a fight he's like no no no no first we must paint the fence
 and take some overshark paint the fence and these guys like and Daniel Sun's
 like like paint the fence he's like paint the fence is he's forcing me's all
 mad and angry and he has three or four chores like that finally comes back to
 Mr. Miyagi's like look dude and this is me paraphrasing he's having some
 movie in a little while but he's like look dude I came here to learn how to
 fight I'm not doing all your chores for you anymore and then all of a sudden
 Mr. Miyagi throws this punch at him right and it's seemed to lead Daniel Sun
 is what whips wax on and blocks the punch and he's like oh and then Mr. Miyagi kicks
 and he's like who paints the fence and blocks the kick and like all of a sudden
 he's like oh that's why he had me wax the wax the car and paint the fence to
 learn these things okay there are gonna be things over the next five days you're
 like why in the world is Russell's talking to us why did Tony tell me do
 this thing why are they asking me to do these things are so uncomfortable I don't
 want to do them this sounds so painful why must I wax the car I just want to
 make money okay I just want to build my brand I just want to change the world I
 do not want to be waxing the car I don't want to be painting the fence I don't
 want to be filling the blank whatever the thing is right there's gonna be times
 it's not gonna make sense you're gonna be confusing me frustrating all these
 things but I want you to believe come into this through a lens of belief believe
 that Tony Dean and I have your best interest believe that we want you to be
 successful believe this is not our first rodeo I went to a rodeo last time so I'm
 using that analogy this is not our first rodeo okay this is not my first time I've
 taken a group people through through a process like this it's not deans it's
 not Tony's we've done it over and over and over again okay and we know how this
 works we know the process we know what'll give you success and we're gonna take
 you that process we're not gonna lead you astray I can tell you anything that's
 not gonna work okay if you've joined this challenge you've entrusted us with that
 you said look I trust you Russell I trust you you trust you Tony please take me
 on this path so that means you need to come into this with full belief do not
 come in skeptical what if this doesn't work what if that or bla bla bla like
 like those are the things that I guarantee if you follow those if you get
 into that trap of skepticism you will fail 100% success or 100% failure rate if
 you have skepticism become in believing that's how you're gonna win okay and I
 can't guarantee your success by can you guarantee that you come in with a with
 a lens of belief and you follow the process you do what we say and you just
 just believe that we know what we're talking about at the end of it your
 chance of success is much higher than if you come in with through the lens of
 skepticism you will not be successfully coming through skepticism so that's kind
 of game plan pretty such I go by some cars some wax car and paint we might be
 good idea so I want to just kind of lead with that because I don't know I know
 these things I've been in this process on my own side right like there's things
 I'm really good like I understand this business game it's fun I understand I
 don't it doesn't stress me out the other parts of my life that freak me out
 that I step into and they're scary and they're they're not comfortable okay
 day two Stacy Martino is gonna be coming and teaching you guys you know
 loves Stacy she she's helped over 10,000 people say their marriage right and it
 doesn't just help save marriage it also make a marriage great and so my wife and
 I went to her event right I was like I want to I want to experience this my
 wife my and my myself and our family and like relationships I have and I went to
 the event and for me that was very uncomfortable I don't like going into a
 room with people talking about our feelings and our emotions right so for
 me like I've been in that same zone you all right but I said look Stacy's gonna
 be my coach in this thing so I'm gonna do what she says even if it makes no
 logical sense and there's a lot of stuff she told me it makes no logical
 sense to my mind yet I believed her and I did it and holy cow it's worked in my
 relationship and like anyway so I want you guys to understand that as you're
 coming into this into this this challenge because so many things are gonna come up
 okay there's gonna be times where you're like this is over my head I get
 information overload I'm overwhelmed or you're gonna come in at a point where
 you're like man Russell and Dean want me to go live or they want me to go do
 this thing let me push a button and I'm gonna put my face out there they want
 me to like make a video they want me to like huh there's gonna be parts you're
 like ah and like your skepticism I was gonna look for every possible way that
 it can fail it's gonna be shifting you're like I can feel there there and it's
 gonna be like yes yes and then and for some reason we want to fail because we
 don't want to like have that fear of like ah you know we want to be able to
 blame it on something so your skepticism I was gonna try and I want you to just
 like put on blinders say look I don't know does it make sense but I believe I
 believe that Russell Dean and Tony I'm my best interest in heart I believe
 they're taking me on this journey I believe them we're gonna do it and if
 you do that you follow up process you guys that's what we can help you that's
 what we can change your life that's what we can give you the transformation
 you need okay so how many guys are there for that how many guys are for 100%
 belief in the process in your mentors in everything we're talking about if
 you're in with the 100% belief in the comments down below say 100% belief I
 want to see that as many people as possible 100% belief I will see like a
 hundred of you guys we have almost 600 on right now so as many as you guys can
 100% belief tell me down below because that is gonna be the key to your
 success okay the skepticism is gonna be the key to your failure come all right
 we've got it coming in we've got the belief we got the belief oh man I'm so
 excited you guys this is gonna be so much fun for those of you guys who have
 if you've ever struggled business in the past or like building a brand like all
 these things when we talk to my few struggle that stuff in the past I'm
 hoping that this is gonna be the thing right all this had that before I got
 successful in business like I spent 18 months I tried thing after thing after
 thing after thing and like I tried everything and then it was like something
 happened where I had my shift and I was like it all makes sense now I can run I
 can go like like my goal I want to give you as that shift that transformation
 this week because as you get it then becomes fun last night we were at the
 rodeo and one of the guys who's at the rodeo here's named Tyson Derpy he's
 that you can look him up he's a world champion calf roper and one of the
 coolest guys I've ever met so we had a chance to watch him compete and we hung
 out afterwards and he's been you know he's been starting his own business and
 building his own brand and it's funny because he told me he's like I struggle
 that struggle I struggle and he's like then I then finally I got it he's like
 and he's like he's like it's the most exciting thing in the world now he's he's
 got his course online he's making I can't I don't want to do any income claims
 he's doing really really well with it though and last night told me like he's
 like it's crazy he's like now I understand he's like I see it everywhere
 he's like I've got a buddy who's an ex football player who's like what he's a
 world champion or a Super Bowl champ and MVP and Super Bowl all these things he's
 like I can take what I know now I can help him do the same thing I just did in
 the rodeo industry I was like I know isn't it crazy like I was the same way
 when I first figured this stuff out I was like I have to tell everybody like I
 was just so excited like the last decade have my life has been dedicated
 to that because it's so exciting it's so much fun and so if you fail in the
 past if you struggle in the past like it's okay I don't don't like put that
 pressure itself come in with a clean slate having belief I open-mindedness
 jumping in this having so much fun and I promise you if you do that we can we
 can give you the transformation okay so that is the magic B word belief okay
 now I'm only going one step further Ken it's interesting because right now the
 biggest goal is for you to believe in the process right to believe in your
 mentors and to go all in and do it right but after you figure out you're
 oh this is actually super easy like why was I stressed about this you have
 success and then what's gonna happen is you're gonna start building your own
 tribe your own people are me coming in you're gonna be serving them and helping
 them what you're gonna find out is your number one goal your number one job
 when you start bringing people in and you're serving them and you're changing
 their lives your number one job is to get them to believe it's crazy people
 asked me all the time with ClickFunnels those who know my companies called ClickFunnels
 we've got 120,000 active entrepreneurs use our platform and and people
 asked me rust what's your job at ClickFunnels what do you do I was like I've
 only got one mission at ClickFunnels my only goal my goal is people to believe
 that this works for them that's it so I do so my books are at my Facebook
 labs my courses my challenge like everything I do is to get my people to
 believe because the process isn't hard you just do it right I've done it at so
 many times it is not difficult at all I can do it in my sleep oh there's an
 anor in my legs sorry anyway I can do it my sleep you give me any product any
 business I can like I know the process like I'm not scared of it I know it and
 so my job is not so like the teaching part is important is there but the
 framework is not difficult it's not the heart my biggest thing is I have to get
 you to believe that's what I've got to do Tony's got to do we I get you to
 believe and when you get your people whatever it is you're doing your same
 job as you got to get your people to believe okay believe the process you
 come to the like the belief cheerleader and so I want you to understand that
 because for a lot of you guys can be uncomfortable right now to get that
 belief out and to be able to do it and so like it's gonna be uncomfortable I
 want you to remember that feeling because as you start serving your people
 they're gonna feel the same thing as well and so you can go back that place
 like man like I remember this one time I took this challenge that was
 uncomfortable for me it was uncomfortable Dean and Tony and Russell would tell me
 to do these things so uncomfortable but I believed him and because of that like
 here's the breakthrough and here's the transformation here's why I'm able to
 serve you now and then for them whatever the business the industry the brand
 of your building and that's your job is you become the belief cheerleader for
 your customers like that's it if I need to believe the process is not
 difficult making money online is not hard building a brand is not difficult
 getting you to believe that you can that's a hard part and so he was like well I
 believe it works Russell it works for you it works for Tony he's a giant for
 crying a lot of course it works for him but know what about me it's not gonna
 work for me right that's the thing that's what I you to believe I don't have to
 get you to believe the process works I know you've seen it you've seen it over
 and over and over and over and over again right I had to get I have to get
 you to believe that you can do it that's the hardest job we've got okay so if
 you come in and like help us by getting that belief coming with harm some
 belief and just and like not coming in skeptical not coming looking for what
 could possibly go on coming with belief it'll change everything it makes our
 job easier and it's gonna be huge and like I said I'm gonna be over the next
 five days you're as biggest belief cheerleader on the planet because I
 believe in you I know that every single one of you guys has a message you have
 a mission you've got something that can change the lives of the people you've
 been called to serve okay I know I've seen it over and over and over again and so
 if I need you to believe that you've got the capacity the ability to tell us
 the things to do it it's not the hard the process is not hard the tactics are
 not difficult okay it's just the belief between your ears you can believe it we
 can achieve it so anyway I appreciate you guys this is gonna be so much fun I
 hate when there's 600 people hanging out with me to to end anything but I want
 to be respectful of your time and let you guys have the weekend to get
 prepared and ready for the challenge again we start Monday it's gonna be so
 much fun if you're not sure what to do I would recommend a couple things number
 one go back through all the pre-trains and meeting they've been doing those are
 worth watching these are mindset shifts we need to give you help you be more
 successful when we get in it number one number two if you haven't got a trial
 to software you don't have to have it to be successful but we create the
 software that's gonna be amazing we're giving you a 14-day trial to play with
 it excuse me lots of you doing the challenge you can do it like on your own
 paper whatever or you can plug in the software as we're doing which is gonna
 be way better experienced for way more fun there's a link I think it's try
 mastermind calm this should be linked above or below me we can go try it it's
 a dollar trial we give that dollar all that money goes to feed feeding kids and
 then you got 14 days 14 days does not start until Monday so you got 14 days
 for Monday to use the software and if you don't like it cancel if you like I
 can't afford it cancel or but like it'll help make the process of this challenge
 way easier because you'll be able to have this tool to plug things in to be
 able to see it and yeah so anyway that's it you guys I appreciate you thanks for
 hanging out this is just beginning this pre-training it's training is not even
 beginning yet Monday it starts I think Monday is gonna be a really fun day I
 me Dean and Tony going live I'd block out at least two hours for it and then
 we're gonna give you homework time at the end and then the homework is gonna be
 like uncomfortable and you're gonna be like God but I don't want to wrestle
 Dean don't make me Tony why are you so big and tall and I just feel like I
 have to do it but you're gonna do it and when you do that you can get more
 belief and then you like oh my gosh I did it I took this uncomfortable action I
 believe I can do it you're gonna believe the next thing and the next thing and
 the next thing if you if you give yourself that permission just to try even
 if it doesn't feel comfortable very soon I promise you as it'll be worth it so
 anyway I appreciate all thanks so much everything Oh Sharon said I bought software
