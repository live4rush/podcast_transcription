 Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson welcome to marketing secrets podcast now. I got a special episode for you guys today
 This is one that because I'm actually on vacation with my family this week
 I wanted to not let the podcast stop one keep giving you guys some cool stuff while I was gone
 And as I was trying to find some interesting things to share with you guys
 I remember that during the expert secrets book launch obviously
 I did a whole bunch of Facebook lives a lot of them are similar because I'm
 we're talking about expert secrets book and
 And so I got to tell a lot of same stories a lot of different ways and things like that
 And it was it was a lot of fun
 But one of the last interviews I did was someone who had time I didn't know who he was
 Become you know somebody I look up to now and really love what he's doing
 And he actually runs a podcast is called the superhuman entrepreneurs
 and it's but it's focused more on doctors in fact he is a doctor's doctor his name is doctor Matt or curso and
 and I
 Think just because of the people that he serves and who you know who he is and also who he's teaching and talking to whose podcast was for
 you know it wasn't so much as
 As often like traditional businesses right like I think a lot of times the things I talk about our position more towards online
 type businesses because that's who a lot of our clients and our customers are but you know
 It's been fun as click for on this has grown we brought in a whole new audience of more traditional businesses doctors dentists chiropractors and on and on and
 You know honesty when I was going to interview
 I didn't know what to expect and if you know how expert secrets in this message would would resonate with that audience
 But the interview was honestly probably my favorite interview during the the sequence during the series
 It was it was something that was just so much fun to do and when it was done. I was just like that was cool
 he asked me questions and
 The nobody else had asked me for and and took the interview in a direction
 I wasn't expecting and I thought it was a lot of fun and so I just actually messaged him today and said hey do you mind if I
 Use this in our in my podcast and let people hear this episode because I think it was unique and
 I think that everyone would get a ton of value out of it and luckily for you and for me and for everyone
 He said yes, and so you guys have a chance to listen in and like I said even though his podcast is more focused on doctors
 The message and what we talk about here is applicable to any type of business
 And I hope you guys love it and you enjoy it and with that said
 Have a good time listening in on this interview
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, welcome ladies and gentlemen to superhuman
 Entrepreneur I'm your host dr. Matt a cursor and today I have a rock star on the show his name is
 Russell Brunson and he
 Literally has a following of millions of entrepreneurs. He sold thousands of his books
 He popularized the concept of sales funnels. He co-founded a software company called click funnels
 And he helps tens of thousands of entrepreneurs quickly get their message out to their marketplace
 Russell man. Thanks for being on the show. Yeah, thanks for having me man. Yeah, I'm super excited for this
 Me too me too brother and you know I saw you at a seminar two years ago
 And I was just really impressed with how transparent you were from the stage at I've always grown up
 You know when I went through my doctorate program, we always learned like sales is sleazy
 It's like from the sewer like never get around people who are in sales and I thought that for a really long time
 And I remember going to this seminar and my uncle who's a doctor saying you don't need to go
 You know to a sales seminar like just you know just you know do stuff in your office and do stuff around your community
 But I was like no, you know
 I really want to be here and I went and I wasn't really here in much that was resonating with me and then you got on stage
 And I think you said something like hey
 I'm not the smartest guy in the room like I didn't really do that well in school
 Like I don't have all the answers
 But this is what I've done that's worked and I want to share it with you guys
 And I was just really impressed by your transparency and the audience was too
 Like you had tons of people raising their hand and like I think a bunch of people raced to the back of the room
 So like get what you are offering so
 Talk to me just like for a minute about
 Like is that that just seems like it's naturally you that's not something that you're you're putting on
 But you do it really well from stage. So is this something you've worked on or is that just you?
 Probably a little bit of both. It's well. It's funny. I interview a little Tony Robbins about the book
 And he asked me like what's the future of business? It's kind of similar the answer is kind of similar
 It's funny because I think
 even like
 Five or six years ago before like all social media was getting big like like selling was about like being posture and slick and like and then like
 Having you know your script perfect and your and your sales letter all copy and all that stuff was like how people sold
 But now it is it's different like like when people are watching you on a webinar like they're googling your name
 They're following you on Facebook. They're looking like they're trying to see if you're legitimate or not and and I found like the more people
 Try to posture and like try to be something that they're not
 In this world it doesn't work and it was good for me because like I never was good that because I always got embarrassed like
 I hate like talking about the numbers or whatever
 it kind of bugs me and so I just and
 So I just kind of started I just always transparent and always was and I think that like the future where this whole business and any
 Businesses and sales as a whole is going to is this less of like the polished sales person or like people that are willing to be
 They're willing to just kind of share their story
 And I don't even work with a lot of doctors and stuff and it's interesting. I have a friend who's a chiropractor here in town
 And when I first met and he's always doing
 He was trying to be like like you know
 like the professional like you know him and suit and tie and do the stuff and the ads were all very like chiropractists
 You know like talking about stuff and they always kind of struggled in and I told them man like vulnerabilities like where
 Where things need to be at because especially your boys
 There's like a chiropractor like two or three on every single corners is like like how you competing with all that like you can't
 You know like and I was like why did you become a chiropractor?
 It was funny because he told me a story. He was like I
 He's like I was I was going into dental school
 I was I was that was the whole thing he was trying to do and
 the time his wife got a huge car wreck and and
 It was really bad. I was trying to all sorts of things and it happened to be like the third or fourth try
 They were to chiropractor like when he had just heard like that like that it healed his wife
 He was like wow wow
 He's like I had such an emotional impact with that like I dropped out of dental school and switched to this and and I was like
 We told me I had chills. I was like dude like that's
 Yeah, that's what they just tell that story. Yeah, you're trying to be so posture
 Just like I'm a you know whatever yeah until that so he made a video of him telling that story and showing like his wife
 And his kids and all stuff and put something out there like Facebook ads and things like that and all of a sudden
 I'm sorry coming people will drive past four or five chiropractor places to get to his because of that and it's like I think that
 We're so like trained to be postured and all thing and it's like if you just become vulnerable like tell the truth
 Like that's what people actually are desiring the connect with way way more man
 I love where this conversation is going because it's so true in the doctor world
 We put on these coats of ego
 And I remember being in my my doctorate classes and there was so much ego in the room
 You could feel it like you could feel everybody almost like wanted to like stomp the other person like they wanted to have a better
 Clinic or like more knowledge or this or that and you're so right. I mean at the end of the day
 People they want to know you care
 They want to know that you have compassion and that you know where they're coming from so I love
 I love where this is going because the cool part about your book expert expert secrets
 I just got this in the mail brother and I'm I'm not a reader like and that's a problem because I'm a doctor
 But I'm not a reader, but I tend to do audio books
 But I mean honestly dude like I have I haven't done these in books in like years
 But I was just I was really blown away man by
 number one the pictures that you have are awesome like the pictures
 Anybody can pick up this book like I'm not I'm not in this world a lot
 And so I don't think of myself as an expert at all, but when I picked up your book
 I immediately understood it like I immediately resonated with me and
 I thought it was cool because in the first pay in the first chapter
 you talk about creating your mass movement and
 There's a little picture there and I had a question for you because the first little guy you have it says charismatic leader an attractive
 character would you say that if somebody wants to get their message out to their audience that they have to be
 Charismatic to do it so it's funny because like some people think charismatic means you gotta be slick
 It's it's not I care like charisma doesn't come from that right charisma comes from connection
 like the people I look at who do I follow because a lot of things that ain't all of us we
 There's different movements we've plugged into right?
 So there's things that you're passionate about and like the leader doesn't necessarily
 I think we think charismatic you think of like a movie star and looks all perfect, but it's not that
 It's like the person who like is is even more excited about this topic than you are
 That's why I plug in people that I some of like the nerdies people in the world, but they're so excited
 I might get in trouble for this one, but my he's become a friend
 But Dave aspirate and bulletproof exactly like he started this movement right and like he's not the most interesting person
 I listen to his podcast I fall asleep to because it's really like he worries me
 Yeah, and like hung out the first time and he was so excited. I've ever told me he's like he's like hey
 When you're not how I buy a hack my allergies, I was like, what do you mean?
 He's like so what I did is like I'm allergic to eggs and and gluten
 So I ate a bunch of eggs and pizza and he's like all sides
 I tell me this story and he's like then and then I don't know this is even the real thing
 I I still think he was joking with me, but he's so serious
 He's like so then like my body I flooded with the antibody
 So I I peed my
 Re-injecting my body and then my body fought that and I cured my allergy and I was like that is so weird
 But like that's awesome
 Because he was so much more excited me. I was like, yeah, okay, I'm plugging into that
 I'm not gonna do that
 That's weird, but like and like that's what Christmas for me is it's not like being like
 The best looking or whatever it's like just being passionate about your thing and like we're all like dying for passion, right?
 Yeah, man
 Most people live really boring lives as we're on Facebook all day on our phones like streaming through the feed like please
 I entertain you give me something and soon someone comes out there's like hey
 And they're excited about whatever your topic is like we plug into those people
 I got five or six people I plug into every single day because they're so excited about their thing
 Yeah, they're craft that like that's what it's all about. Yeah, yeah, it's like super charismatic is
 I guess maybe not that's where like someone who's like
 Like so passionate that that's what that's what we all want to do man for sure because I think there's this fear in our culture
 You know, I was just talking with this young doctor the other day
 And you know, and I've been there myself. I mean I have had I've had to work on my message
 I mean I've been working on it for eight years now
 And I think just now am I getting to a point where I'm actually getting transparent
 I feel like I thought I was transparent three years ago, but like now that I see myself then I'm like
 I wasn't transparent at all I had this like bank teller window in front of me still, you know
 And I feel like in the doctor world we have these bank teller windows like we don't want you to get past the window
 We want to keep you right there because then I won't look professional. You won't respect me
 You'll think I'm goofy whatever it is and I was talking with this this young doc yesterday
 And she was like yeah
 I just don't want to put myself out there because
 I'm afraid that somebody else will know more than me and then you know, they'll like comment on my video and she's really afraid of
 people talking negative about her like as she's thinking a lot about what other people will think and
 She's new to the game. So she's thinking. I'm just an amateur like how do I get people?
 To respect me and I think it's maybe a little bit worse
 For women in the doctor world at times because they feel like they have to like keep up with the Joneses more than men do
 but what would you say to that person who
 Desires to be an expert and they want to go on the internet and do it they want to go online and do it
 But they're they're starting by being an amateur and I think you know every all of us have been there
 Like what's the process to get to being an expert and having people actually value your advice and take your advice?
 Yeah, so pray two is really is gonna mind as you're saying that's number one. It's like it's okay to say
 I don't know I'm not my friend told me like they don't respect most about you. I asked you question
 You don't know you don't try to make something up there. I don't know. That's a good question
 Like if I figured out let you know
 Like be okay with that like you don't have to know all the answers like people aren't coming
 You can know all the answers and come to you because you know an answer. Yeah, you just need one
 Number two in the next receiver's book. I talk about the movie catch me catch me if you can
 Movie there's also based on a book and read the book
 Frank Abenow you know Leonardo Caprio plays he actually taught a year of socioli advance sociology of BYU
 Right bring me university and he just showed up there in class one day and there was no teacher
 So we grab the book came up start teaching the class and taught entire semester of that and when the feds
 I can catch him for wire fraud check for everything else he did yeah
 They were interviewing the aspect how in the world did you teach advanced sociology to this to this class and
 What he said was interesting said he said well
 I just read one chapter ahead and like there's so much power in that like a lot of the things that like I
 Will help serve and chain and teach people and help people when I'm somewhere right?
 Yeah, and it's like probably you never get there first off the second off like there's so many people
 You're not serving during the process because you're waiting for something Tony Robbins
 He told me that when he first was getting into his career
 This new this new scientists coming out called NLP which is kind of a big deal nowadays back then it was a new thing
 I excited so we excited for a like a six month certification program
 He went to this thing in the first after two days he had these tools
 He was like let's go help people and then I know you're not certified
 He's like you don't understand like there are people in pain out there
 Let's go help him and I know you have to be certified before you so he got a master he left and like
 And they walk across your thing I hopper
 I was 7 11 or something and you start like fixing people and like because he had the tools to help people
 He was helping him and then he had to be kicked out of the the certification programs
 He was like practicing without a certification
 He's like look we have tools today like like you're one step ahead of someone else like go grab those people to help
 Like bring them to you as quick as you can you don't have to wait till you're the finish line like help them now
 If you've got tools today. Yeah, yeah, that's the thing and the third thing I would say is
 Because I like all this deal with this I dealt with it
 As we first off putting things out that there's always like the keyboard chumps who want to like jump in and like tell you why you're wrong or talk
 Trash or whatever. Yeah, and it used to like destroy
 I get a negative email and for like three days and just sit there like why am I I'm trying to help people and like
 Why is this person so mean and the thing that was like liberating for me one of my mentors is Dan Kennedy?
 He I was listening to one of his things and he said it he said if you haven't offended someone by noon every single day
 Then you're not marketing hard enough
 I like that like what and then I never meant when I'm after he said every time he gets negative email he stands up and he
 I was like raw
 like
 Do you see he had his goal of like the news he's pushing it hard up and like
 At first like it was weird. I was like I don't get that but then like I started realizing like
 There's this thing if you're doing business right we talk about this near as well
 We talk about polarity like if you're not if you're not some kind of polarity then you're you're neutral like nothing ever is ever gonna happen, right?
 Yeah
 But if you have some polarity like that's when you get attention
 That's when like people come to you but the nature being polar is that like
 You become polar like there's a group that loves you
 But there's a group that has to hate you like it just yeah
 I want the other yeah
 when you realize that like there are people that hate me like and that's okay best because if
 If I didn't have haters there's no way I may have people that love me right there
 Yeah, you have one without the other so it's like you celebrate those things and realize like look if one person's upset that sucks
 But it's okay because it means 10 15 20 other people are listening to my message
 And like it's actually a good gauge if you're doing things right as if you're getting a little bit of that
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I have a mentor that says turn your haters into escalators and I love that man because it's like
 It's so true
 You just like step you know like if you got to walk up them then walk up them to get to your goals
 But you know I don't listen to us
 But yeah, you know one of the other things that I really love about the book Russell and it's like when you read it
 I feel like you're giving everything away. I feel and and and maybe you are like maybe this
 I mean it just seems like this is the whole the book is everything you need to
 go out there and completely crush it and build a movement and build an audience and
 That's one thing that I love about your heart is that you are
 Literally, I mean I know it's hard for people to grasp that note know you
 But I mean just just from reading the book and I just watched some interviews with you like you're all about seeing people succeed
 Like and I like that's essentially looks like why you got into what you're doing
 So I want to I wanted to talk to you about it in chapter four
 You mentioned the the value ladder and you talk about the concept that it's it's not about selling someone more stuff
 Will you will you expound on that because I think that as like doctors anybody out there like not just doctors
 But I kind of speak in the doctor realm
 But I think and I I felt this way too
 How do you like you're selling something but how do you not sound like you're selling something like you're you're on Facebook?
 You're you're doing your thing out on the internet and like you made a video to intentionally like grab people in
 But one thing that you do exceptionally well is is like it doesn't feel like you're
 Selling to people it feels like you're actually giving stuff away more than anything like this book for instance like you're not you're not charging anybody for this thing
 It's free
 So it's like you're giving your stuff away, but I know you're you're making money like you're doing really well
 So how do you yeah? How do you do I guess I know that's a lot at one time
 But take all my jargon and like explain it to the audience in your way
 Yeah, it's funny cuz there's this huge misconception people have of that like I see all the time
 I like you my room like by my course
 I'll give you the the rest of it and like oh like I hate that because
 Then you feel like you got jet and what I found it's funny. So I was at it
 Like what am I meant to her stank hitting super old grumpy man who if you see me like why do you like him?
 He's so grumpy. He's brilliant right and I was this I was at this Dan Kennedy event and
 And he's been doing this for like forever like since the dinosaurs right and
 He there's probably a thousand people who are me like how do you guys come to my events for at least 10 years?
 And like half the audience comes up he's like stands up like you know sit down if you've been or stay steady up
 You've been coming more than 15 years more than 20 years more than 30 and up to 40 years
 Are so like a dozen people still standing and he's like you guys I've I've not taught anything new at least at least 35
 40 years like it's the same thing over and over again. He's like
 He's like why are you guys keep coming back and like everyone's like no one really knew and they said that he taught us the lesson
 so look like people
 Like sometimes we think like they're coming for like the tip like what's the secret?
 I get that and like I'm out, but it yeah, they come for that initially
 But they connect with like with you with the personality right there
 That's why and so someone comes I read this book and like if they get value from it
 And it's funny like as I've been launching this book and a whole bunch of people my inner circles
 made a circle $25,000 a year
 I have a hundred entrepreneurs are in it and you give me time and
 What's funny is that for the last year with this group all I've been working on is this product this process with them in depth
 And all every single one of my interviews been fight
 It's been funny because they're like I think it was $25,000 and you literally gave you everything we talked about for the last 12 months
 And right I'm kind of mad but same time. It's like
 It's like they're excited about to because it's like they're so excited to share this thing as well
 Yeah, and like what's interesting is that I
 Said before people that spend more money for the same stuff but packaging different ways right there's experiential stuff as well
 So it's like it's sitting like I can go to the web MD and get answers most my medical problems like yeah
 They're probably there like the archive. I'm sure they're all there somewhere if I look for it
 But like there's something about like we want the experience want to come in want like all the other the other things right?
 Yeah, Michael some some reason is booked and like wow
 Russell gave it all
 But then like in here I talk about like I was software that helps make this process easier
 So like you should try like you don't have to do it like it helps like it's really good
 People try the software and then they hear a major circle and like people want to come to that and then they come to advance because one
 With other people who are I geekin at about this as well and like so the other things we're doing but
 It's just understanding like not not being so fearful of that people aren't coming and like getting your best thing and taking off and leaving
 Like they're trying to find again
 They're looking for things to plug into like they want to be part of something as well
 This book is not about like how to make a transaction and make a sell and on the internet
 It's like how do we build a tribe of people who come to us who are like want to be part of this in the community and yeah
 All this yeah, we're creating I love it man
 I love it
 The more you're willing to kind of just get people stuff and we do it strategically obviously
 It's not just like here's everything for free. Yeah, the same time you get really cool
 In fact I had two people made her circle this week message me asked me like I should show you the hilarious like is there anything else
 We can buy from you like we feel so guilty about all the stuff
 Like we give you more money
 That's right man
 It's like the coolest thing in the world. That's all like it's just cuz like they they feel such reciprocity
 the more you do for people the more that they they want to do back for you and and
 Yeah, anyway, so that's yeah
 That's how I built my business and it served us really really well
 And I think what sir what hurts more people than not is I can't play any books
 I've read where I read the book and and I have to do book Mike
 This is a sales letter for something else
 Yeah, I want to like blow it like so we call it we call it the value ladder here right the whole constant die ladders like you give
 Like people people naturally want to send they want they want some nice
 They're gonna test you out so they're gonna read your book
 Yeah, and if they give value from that like that was awesome. I got value like I want more same thing like
 Well, I met my wife the first day right we're gonna date and do date like that I was three value
 Yes, cool. We should go on a second day
 Yeah, you see you see value there
 Then you want the net and you like you naturally will send through things and it's the same in business like someone will have an interaction
 With you and then what I found is that people will continue to buy from you to one of two things happen number one
 Until you offend them or number two until you stop selling stuff
 Like we actually want to send the relationship inside of business
 Just like we do it in a personal relationship
 And so it's like they receive value from a book if you get that book and you receive value
 That was awesome. I want more of that. What else the Russell have oh cool. He's got a soft look
 We try that out receive value. That was awesome. What else is yeah?
 There's an event cool. I want to go to that receive value there. Oh, man
 I want to join the inner circle like it's all about like if you blow their mind every single phase of this thing where they're getting value
 Yeah, as beings we crave more of that thing that we just that experience. We've had one more of it
 Yeah, yeah, so hopefully not give an about experience was like I
 Then they they don't naturally want the next thing
 But if you give an amazing experience that they want to keep they want to keep progressing with you
 Hey, they're superhuman dr. Matt here interrupting this incredible show and I don't feel guilty one bit

 Where would you recommend someone start cuz I think
 Webinars like people think okay, I'm gonna get on I'm gonna get on you know Facebook
 I'm gonna do a zoom call whatever and I'm gonna do a webinar and
 You know all of a sudden I'm gonna have all these people like flooding into my schedule
 Like do you recommend that somebody just go out and do a webinar or do you recommend?
 They start somewhere else if they want to build their brand and start building their audience
 So kind of it kind of depends where in their journey that their app but like I'm a big believer in
 The best way to sell something is not to like learn how to sell it the best way to sell it is to like get results for somebody else
 Like when I launched my my inner circle coaching program. I didn't go and make a video of me like hey
 I'm Russell Brunson
 I'm amazing. You should pay me $25,000 to coach with me because that first up that's like annoying right like this the whole like
 Posturing positioning stuff. Yeah, and second off I can just I was filled dirty
 So right as I as I was like, okay, who's my dream customer?
 I could I love to actually work with every single day and I've identified a couple different people and one of them was a guy named
 Drew Canole he owns a company called FitLife TV and it's up in line for now called Organifi and I saw him and
 The time I was going to a juicing stage in my life and I was like I'm juicing I connected with Drew
 Like I was plugged into him right he was one of the guys I was following I'm like this guy is awesome
 And so I reached out to him connected with him and he had luckily heard who I was and and
 And I mess him I was like is there any way can come out and just serve you and work for you and like help you guys out
 It's like what's it gonna cost him like no just for free
 I'm gonna come and just like I just want to help you and he's like he's like what's the catch?
 I'm like seriously no catch like I love what you're doing
 I've got some skills and stuff on yeah, I love to serve you to see if I can help you and
 Finally reluctantly he's like alright if you want to that's weird, but that's brilliant
 man
 So I flew out to his company and I get there and it's funny
 I mean there's a little conference room with him and his team and
 And I kind of do with what they were doing and I saw some spots like what I knew I could help from you know
 Looking outside in as we started this meeting and I was like well tell me about what you're doing and
 And I looked it was weird
 I got the room because I feel a sense of like it wasn't good when I got in the room like something was wrong and
 And and his CTO CFO sorry get all the technical terms messed up
 but the finance dude was like should I show him the numbers and he's kind of like guarded and just like yeah
 Show them everything who cares so projected numbers on the wall and I was like oh man like they're in big trouble like
 Like month and a half away from like this whole thing disappeared Wow and it's tough because they're like over a million bucks a year
 But like just the metrics were working mm. I'm like crap. I didn't rise this situation. They're in so
 the whole day like
 Showing them like the holes in with their current strategy was how to fix it and then they had this idea for a supplement
 So we helped them like I showed him how to model how to do supplement funnel and we were not the whole thing out and anyway
 We did all thing
 In the next two or three weeks, you know
 Remote I was kind of coaching him through how to do it and so they they they tweaked the the existing funnels
 They launched the supplement funnel and supplement funnel like the way we structured like it just worked
 They launched it day one how to get to a huge success year one that 20 million dollars and stuff and something like it was just
 Success for them, right?
 So the drugo makes a video for me like Russell came this is how change everything
 We were from like the brings the bankruptcy like transforming everything and like so true drew like this success story got from him
 He's telling the story
 I put it applied to work with Russell by underneath it and that's like my whole
 right now cool you are and
 And so I always tell people like if you want it if you really believe in whatever whatever is your seller
 Okay, it's a product of service to you know
 Whatever it is like that you can go and try to sell it
 That's hard instead like go and like find somebody you can work for free like serve them and give to them like
 Those that you were amazing what you do and transform their life as radically as you can yeah
 And then capture those stories and that is your sales process
 It's not you being a salesperson is you sharing a really good story about about the results you got for somebody else like yes
 Yes, that's yeah, yeah, man. They're the future of the
 businesses is is that transfer is sharing your transformations not try to trick somebody to give you money
 Yeah, man
 That's huge because I was just thinking about my own life and how I mean I went through that exact scenario where I felt like
 If I if I give away too much someone's gonna say well I have everything
 I don't need to work with him anymore and I remember running into this this one patient that was just really hard
 Like he just wasn't getting results. He was just he's just always always grumpy always in a always in a bad mood
 Always like none of this is working like fasting doesn't work on me. I'm always sick. I can't take supplements
 I can't drink water my gut, you know gets inflamed like everything I did with him was wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
 So finally I just said hey, you know what?
 You don't have to pay me for this month
 I just want to do these these things on you and it was almost like once I
 Let go like once he once he saw that I wasn't about the dollar amount that I really wanted to see him heal
 All of a sudden he began to heal and it was just it was just really really cool, you know
 So so from what you're saying Russell
 I just like things are just clicking because I think that
 We need more of that and you know we need more of that and the internet
 We need more of that in sales. We need people need to see that we're we're about see you're you're about seeing people
 run into their purpose and
 you know, it's just really optimizing their passions and live the life of their dreams and
 That's what I get from you brother. That's what I get from the book
 I'm literally I literally want every doctor that listens to this podcast to read expert secrets because I I know it's gonna change their life
 I mean, it's already changed my life. I've already seen like 10 or 11 things that I'm just not doing when it comes to
 My sales process and the way that I speak with people and even even my story
 I'm gonna change that around just from reading your book
 One other thing that I did want to mention was the book is expert secrets
 Do you recommend that someone is an expert in something in order to read the book or do you can anybody pick up this book?
 And they're gonna glean stuff from it. Yeah, it's it's funny
 That was like my biggest fear calling expert secrets because a lot of people go resonate with that or they're like
 They're super introverted like oh, I can't I want to do that, you know
 This is like a double-edged sword because at the same time
 It's like I want people to hear it's a calling for them, right?
 Like if you met me outside of this kind of circumstance like I am super introverted shy nervous
 My wife came for my events for me one time and she's like why are these people like so excited to see you?
 Like why are they taking the picture in the end at the end of the night?
 She's like and you talk so much. She's like I've never heard you talk this much
 Because for me wasn't about like I was gonna become an expert. I was never on my radar like for me
 I started learning some of these these tools and things and and you know back then I was selling potato gun DVDs
 I was like doing stuff. I was like learning the stuff and I was like I
 Could sell anything on earth and I was I was so excited
 I want to show other people and like and but I didn't know how and I didn't know how to do it like I didn't you know
 And so his book takes you up process like if you're excited about something
 You know you have gifts and skills and like I believe God's given every one of us like things that we can use to help
 Change other than life. It's all happened
 As soon as you're passionate about that like this books and help you like how do you find your voice like?
 Because I didn't know how to do that like nobody taught me and it was like me awkwardly trying things a whole bunch of times
 And I look at videos for me five years ago
 And like I was so scared to be knowing video like I wouldn't look directly at the camera
 It's just funny
 I was like I was talking to camera looking down full-time explaining these I wouldn't look up at the camera the entire time
 So so shy and like nervous about just looking at the little thing that you know
 It's right there
 Yeah, it's funny now
 But like we all go through that and some people are
 Extroverted experts to begin with and battle resonate with you guys but the rest you want you to understand like it's not about
 You already knowing that stuff. It's it's like are you passionate about something?
 You excited?
 Do you know what you have can change people's lives?
 So this is a calling for you like listen to that because book will help you to do that help you to find your voice and help
 You figure how do I build a tribe of people who I can share this with I can serve
 Yeah, for me like this is all about serves like we're serving people. Yeah, and Zig Ziglar
 We're my other mentors. He said if you help other people how do you say if you help everybody else around to get what they want
 Like you do whatever you want life
 And so like the money will come when you focus on like how do I serve this tribe of people?
 How can I do it the best way in the highest level and you know for me my in my community like
 From years I struggle to try to make money and like there's this weird thing was like when you're trying to make money
 That's your focus like you will always struggle as soon as like who are my people?
 Yeah, I
 Obsessed my entrepreneurs like let me get on to yours. You know, let me help him in this like how can I serve then I'm like
 Can we create software we do books?
 We do that like the obsessed like how can I serve these people saying get a message out?
 Like we become I mean I made more money in the last two and a three years and then most of them make them a lifetime
 I did not know yeah, yeah, but it's more she comes serving that tribe then all the other stuff will come that you're looking for
 Yeah, but forgetting like almost like forgetting that part and coming back to like
 Looking at this group like what else can I give and how's gonna help them when I was a and now becomes your focus?
 It becomes transparent
 I don't think anyone in here thinks that I'm in this for the money if they do like they're not paying attention
 Yeah, I care less like I mean because like I legitimately I see what an entrepreneur can do in the world
 And if I can change one entrepreneur and give one set of tools like I was telling someone earlier today
 We've got a group that's a cute amazing couple in the weight loss space
 And it's so cool because they got started two years ago with us
 At nothing and last month they had the record month a million dollars a month
 A decided for the weight loss programs. They have how many like how many was that 500 women a day
 Is that 500 in a compound every day 500 a thousand fifteen hundred two and in a month period time like that's how many women's lives
 She's able to affect because she's learned how to get a message out
 And I can I can help any of those women like I have no skills help warmly's way
 Yeah, but like I give them tools which and I tell the story a lot in this book because like they did they followed it to a tea like
 There's funny
 Brand and this was Brandon and cave and Brandon's the husband and he's kind of does more the marketing. She's she's the face
 She's amazing. Okay, selling your feet
 They told me like when they start going through our stuff like most people read the whole book and listen all their training course
 And they come back try implement like he was he was like a Nazi you like he'd read the first face
 Okay, so I'm meant to not every page to tell us done
 They do it and they come back and and they grow the shoes business from that but like I look at that like
 I don't have the skills that they have at all
 but like I
 Also would give them some tools and direction and some stuff and then now I'll get over the next 10 years
 How many lives do they will affect it's it's it's immeasurable. Yeah, okay?
 Do you know with organ if I like how many lives he's affecting like I could have done you that yeah, but I get the tools to get that out and
 it's like if all this looks at our communities are tribes that way
 It would shift your focus to like how do I serve these people because everyone I serve like I mean more people lives impacted. Yeah, it becomes
 Like so exciting. That's awesome. I feel your passion, man
 Coming through the computer and I know everybody else is too and I'm gonna tell you this like and man
 This is I'm really I'm not just saying this to like the audience out there
 You know Russell and I just met like literally we just met you can ask his assistant like we've never talked before
 But I will be like completely transparent with everybody out there
 I have never ordered a free book in my entire life
 I've never gone through a funnel and gotten a free book ever. This is the first free book
 You can document this but I've ever gotten okay, and I'm blown away like I there Russell
 I do not have a deal going like this is just like I wanted to have him on because I I believe in his message and
 I truly truly believe those of you out there who you want to build if you want to get your message out to the masses

 You hear how literally nothing's gonna stop him from changing the world if you feel that inside of yourself

 Everybody out in the superhuman world out there that we may have left out or something that is on your heart that you want to share
 One real quickly that I got last thing

 Before the book was done. I did three hour earth

 But the last thing I want to leave is I believe like I put 18 months of my life into this book like this was not just
 I see a lot of people write a book in a day or an hour a weekend or whatever that was not this like I put a lot into it because
 I believe that first off
 I believe it gives everyone the tools that they need that will change their life
 Which is which is awesome
 But like more importantly is it gives you the tools to build change other people's lives and what you will find
 Your own successes and I know everyone here's had success like it it feels so good like like I won that that was awesome
 But like when you when you take those those God give them talents you have and you help somebody else
 And then they have success like it is a thousand times better than any of your own successes
 Like my webinars where I win it's like yeah, we did good
 But like when Brandon and Kaylin sent me a message on my phone and they showed me what they just did like oh
 Like that is I celebrate ten times more flex so much more exciting
