 Hopefully enjoyed day number one and two if you haven't listened to the shake go check out those and then make sure you get ticket
 Fun hiking live calm
 We've sold out every year in a row and now you've got some time to start planning and preparing
 So might as well get your ticket now and then prepare your babysitting and get it on your calendar all kind of stuff because
 Every single year people like oh if I would have known what was happening that I wouldn't have missed it
 Okay, you know now you've been warned
 So here you take it from like you live that says just queue up the theme song and I'll see you guys in a second
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, welcome back so
 Day number one was deep went into the foundation day number two we talked about funnels and traffic and stuff like that
 Day number three now, which was Friday
 This is where we start getting into selling and the Ducoma Club and the future which is really fun
 So the way it started is
 the very first person up was mr. Myring golden and if you don't know myron yet man, there are a few people on this planet that
 like every time he talks, it's just like gold falls out of his mouth like I love him I respect him like I'm so grateful for him and
 He spoke about how to sell and he totally like
 Shifted people's minds and like it's interesting because a lot of people you did this whole
 I wish I could show you the whole presentation dang it. Why would you there if you were there?
 Thank you for being there
 We talked about how money is measured more in time than in than in wealth right so that if you make if you make a million bucks
 Are you rich instead what depends on how fast you make it right? So if you make million bucks for the next 40 years
 That's 25,000 dollars a year like a you're rich no, but if you make a million dollars next 12 months are you rich?
 Yes, like the same amount of money, but it's the time and it's funny
 He did this whole joke joke about like it's like he's like that's why if someone says like is this a get rich quick
 Get rich quick seems that it better be or I don't want part of it right like I make a million bucks next 40 years
 Or I can make it in next year
 But just understanding that and just so many things to like break people's minds that about what's possible of money and wealth and like
 So cool. So my friend killed it as always
 After that the Jim Edwards came out in a huge blow up unicorn outfit
 and
 It was interesting because his presentation was on copy right back to side
 I was like make him thirsty then sell them a drink. That was kind of how this presentation we came out there and did his thing
 but was interesting is
 It was so cool because
 Like it was like probably the most emotional presentation the whole thing and I'm not gonna try to tell the stories that want to ruin
 them, but I'm telling stories about about what money like what money made possible and like how he literally was able to save his
 His son's life and like it was it was amazing and emotional and afterwards
 He had this he had me come back on stage because I can't remember his acts
 I'm probably gonna mess up the story and apologize if Jim's listening to this, but it was like eight thousand seven hundred something dollars
 What he was making per year back in the day and then that's how much he needed to like
 Help people so he actually had me come out on stage and he gave me a check for the exact same amount to give to OUR
 It was just really symbolic of
 What's possible when you when you do these things right possible possible how money can change people's lives and it was really really cool
 So she killed it people were crying and it was funny and fun and like he's just awesome. I love Jim after that
 Then we had
 You got a golden get up and talk about email story selling. I've wanted to do an email session for years and never have because
 I just haven't I just haven't worked right yet and but y'all has been
 She's been in my inner circle with her boyfriend James for the last couple years and like always pay attention
 She had her own business and other things and recently over last year and half two years
 She started like writing emails for herself like doing story selling emails and like getting good at him
 And they're different other people and she's just she did a bunch for me as well
 And like she became really really good at this and like I wanted people
 Here for company is number one we need to become better story colors
 I mean become better at sending out emails telling stories and I think her presentation nailed out the second part is like
 I think it's interesting and this is kind of like she didn't talk about specifically
 But I hope people kind of got this is like there's so many pieces in this business, right?
 There's like there's like the traffic and funnels and design and email and like but all these things like she took just one piece of that
 Right she took the piece of like I'm gonna come really good email story selling and she geeked out on a master that studied it
 It became great that one piece right and then she started doing that for herself made more money
 They started for other people and and again
 I don't know how much money she's making right now
 But the like a year ago when I was talking about she's like yeah
 I just passed thirty thousand dollars a month writing emails people
 I'm like thirty thousand bucks a month as someone who just writes emails like that's insane like for anybody as you're going through if you
 Like learn one skill inside of fun-locking live you take that skill and become a master at it
 And then charge people to do it for them for their funnels, right?
 So you got it in like has this huge thriving business now writing emails for other people
 So anyway, I want to show up for two reasons number one is like the skill sets of number two is like understanding
 Just grasp me like man master one of these skills and become the expert at that and it creates a whole new
 You know huge income stream business for you. Okay after y'all
 I got done then Brendan Bouchard went up and it's funny because Brendan and the last day we had been doing his high performance
 presentation which is fun and high energy and here he's teaching like a more nerdy funnel one right he how he does the
 seven-day launch funnel and
 But I was like man, my people will love you and respect you more if you do this first because then they understand like you're one of us
 Like you do funnels just like so he laid out the framework for his seven-day launch funnel, which was really cool same funnel that he taught this to me
 Almost two years ago now actually was two years ago right now to this month and was right when I was launched my expert
 Secrets book and so we actually did the extra secrets book
 And then did seven-day launch right afterwards and we needed a quick million bucks
 From that so he showed the whole funnel and walked it through it was really cool as well
 and then after that then miss Julie Stoyne got up and and
 She gave a really special presentation. I was really excited for it was it was
 We call it freelancer secrets how to start your own agency like how to like if you don't have a business
 You don't have a product yet. How do you start this game?
 How do you get this thing all kicked off and you do it by starting your own agency and she came and gave his presentation
 How she started when she was you know a single mom and all these things and bills and all these problems and like what does she do?
 She's like well
 I I learned these skills and they started being a freelancer
 I did it for other people then I made someone in two comic club
 And then I started using the skills for my own things and then now I'm doing it for Russell's company like to share this whole journey
 And then for most people today, you don't know where to start like you start by being a freelancer
 You start by by doing that like that's where you begin it right and she
 Presentation so I want to make everyone on a community watch it like it was so so so good. She just nailed it
 and
 I felt bad for she's so funny. She's like after Brendan got done
 She's like why not speak after Brendan? That's not fair, but she held her own and just it just killed it was amazing
 So then after that oh and then she showed a trailer for a new TV show coming out called freelancer secrets
 Which is hilarious and so we showed that then they went to lunch they came back from lunch then we had
 The two of the guys from JK studios, which if you watch studio C
 Studio C is like clean comedy if you go to YouTube is typing studio C
 It's like the best comedy for your kids to watch like every Sunday my kids like I watch TV right you can only watch studio C
 because it's like
 10 out 10 seasons of like clean sketch comedy like it's amazing
 But they recently all the the founders of studio C ended up leaving starting their own company called JK Studios
 and we sponsored the very first show and so it's called freelancer secrets and
 It's kind of fun
 So part of the sponsor thinking we've clicked funnels into some of the things they're doing
 So they had one episode where they actually built a funnels had a click funnels
 And so they have the first episode done so we actually got a show it so they had we had a map meets and Stacy Harkey
 Actually come on stage and it kind of set up tell about it and watch the episode it was so funny was so awesome
 So you're gonna see eight episodes this year of the freelancers
 Which is a TV show we're sponsoring an online TV show and then we've clicked funnels into which is so cool so fun
 Anyway, so that's how that we watched that with everybody now that got done then we did the presentations and we started with the inner circle members
 Everyone who wanted a circle member of the month came up on stage and we were an inner circle member of the year
 Which was Dave Lindenbaum, which is awesome and at that then we did our
 Affiliate dream car winners wrote them on stage and we did to comic club award winners and had like
 200 plus people come on stage and win a two-com a club and then we did to come up X
 Which we had like a new like 25 or something like him or Zach number 25 people went to come X meaning
 They made over ten million dollars in the funnel and we since huge award ceremony
 Which was amazing and fun and pictures with everybody and I always tell people like this is like the the Oscars the emmys of entrepreneurship
 And it's just fun is crazy to me every single year
 I'm always thinking like all people are gonna like you know not come to this session
 They're gonna stay on the hallway or whatever they're gonna you know
 It's crazy every year the entire room is filled and people sit there quiet for like an hour and a half
 But we get awards and I think for most people it's this time to they sit back and reflective like yes
 I hit the award or I didn't and like what do I gotta do for next year to be able to get this and it's just like I don't know
 It's special. It's one of my favorite parts about fun. I can live and so we gave everyone their awards
 And then when it got done we did a quick break and we came back and I did a presentation called secrets of the Tacoma Club
 Which is like like what these people are getting into comic book?
 What do they know that you don't know right if you're not here yet? There's something they know and so we have to like
 Understand what they know and to believe what they believe we're gonna do it
 And so instead of me just doing a whole presentation
 I brought some amazing people from the inner circle to come up and tell parts of the story things that that they believe that
 I think everyone has to believe if they're gonna actually do it right and so
 First I had Chris work he came up and talked about forgiveness
 A lot of people aren't successful because they haven't forgiven themselves or have been for even other people and they hold that resentment back
 Which keeps them from moving forward and Chris he you guys heard a podcast episode a little while
 I shared him speaking inner circle about forgiveness. It was insanely amazing
 So we did a whole presentation on that and he had ever do this forgiveness prayer, which was so cool
 It was amazing other than like I got three people who complained that we prayed in an event
 But you know that's what we do. It's my event. So I will I had no Chris is gonna pray
 But I'm grateful he did we know the people I had one guy
 Message is like I'm an atheist
 He's like first time ever prayed my life and like he's like it it changed everything for me and other things
 It was just you know
 It was a really special experience
 Chris came talked about forgiveness because that was the first thing it's forgive yourself if you were going to move forward right
 That was number one then James frill James people got up talked about an identity shift
 I thought when he went on to but he wanted to become a drummer he's such a drumming
 But he's like if I'm gonna become a drummer
 I feel like I had to act like a drummer so they thought I bought drumsticks and drum clothes and I bought like the stuff
 I got in the lessons and like I had to become like I should my entity
 Identity become a drummer if I was gonna become a drummer or a lot of people like they want to lose weight
 But they like like oh, I'm gonna lose weight and lose weight
 But until they shift their identity like I'm someone who's fit. I'm someone who's in shape
 It's almost impossible lose weight. So the next lesson was like you have to actually shift your identity to like I am a marketer
 I am a funnel builder
 I'm a funnel hacker like if you want shift your identity you can come these events all you want until you shift your identity
 You never have the results and success you want so Chris talked about forgiveness and James talked about
 Shifting your identity then number three
 I have the amount of order here. I think number three was Jason Martino
 I heard you'd up and talk about your seventh power community
 And she has this cool concept called right hand left hand which I may have her do a whole podcast on that in the future
 But it's really just a really cool thing understanding like there's your family in one hand who you love
 But they're not into personal development and marketing these kind of things over here
 It doesn't make them bad and make some great and then left-handed people that like in your tribe in your community
 Who are I obsessed with you like if you're like I'm going on a juice cleanse like sweet
 I'll do it too and like they're all excited and said that a lot of times we
 So they take your left hand right and you put them together it crushes the people in the middle and said you understand that like
 It causes conflict and a lot of times we try to get we go home to our friends and our family who we love who are amazing
 We're trying to like hey come juice cleanse with me. You read this book
 You just go this training course and like we just kind of bombarded all of our personal envelopment stuff on people and like they feel alienated
 It causes separation and no way to understand like the people in your left hand
 Those people who love that stuff like geek out with them people in your hand
 You don't try to shove these things down your throat
 You just be an example to him and if you're an example some will come and follow you and others won't and that's okay
 But just like understanding which hand people you're dealing with are so you can understand these are my community
 Who are folks and this stuff these are my people I love over here. It was just
 Such a key important part a lot of people get those things mixed up which causes the the problems by they don't succeed
 So say she talked about that then a miren golden caught up came up and talked about building it like making a covenant
 Like how do you actually make a commitment and a covenant as opposed to a contract?
 And you have to cut it with yourself if you're gonna actually have success and talk about that whole thing like you have to make a
 Covenant and a commitment if you're actually gonna get to be successful and
 It was amazing and the steven Larson came up and talked about just in time learning like you're gonna go read 50 books be successful
 It's like understand the steps what's the next step and then just geek out learning exactly need to learn to do that next step
 That's it because too many too many
 Entrepreneurs are trying to read a book a week and trying to like listen 400 podcasts a week all these things
 It's like no no like when you're a CEO and you're running a business
 You can go read a book a week
 But when you're the entrepreneur trying to start a phase you're gonna be focused on like what's the next step and just put a hundred
 effort time energy into that next step and just focus on that which is amazing
 So he did that and then I then I kind of had them all go down. I did a presentation on the who not the how
 Which I was really proud of and then the lawful which I'm not gonna get into this podcast might be confusing
 But it was this whole concept like understanding it's not about
 Understance about learning how to do all these things understanding who are the people you need to be able to get your vision
 How do you get there the fastest?
 And it was really fun and that whole that whole presentation and then and then we sold once a year
 We sell to comic Club X coaching program and what's cool is everyone who renewed from last year?
 I gave these huge watches which really symbolic and meant a lot to me and we got in design to be clickfunnels watches
 So he gave all of them and I said, you know
 Everyone's got a clickfunnels watch now come up on stage and over 300 people from the audience came up on stage with me
 And I said this is your tribe if you decide to come with this
 This is your your tribe here and I said the who's your mentors?
 I brought up the coaching staff
 We had none these are your coaches your mentors. This is your tribe. These are people who support you to get you to the
 Comic Club by next year
 So they it was like super overwhelming it was way more people than I thought as we brought one stage
 Which was really cool
 They all sat down then this presentation made them an offer for two comic Club X
 which turned out amazing and
 Yes, that was awesome that we broke for dinner and the afternoon
 We had another session where people who took the two comic Club X program last year had success
 They came back and showed their stories from stage, which was amazing
 And and a lot of people started for two comic Club X coaching at that point and that was that was
 Friday so that was their day such a good day so many cool things from the belief to selling to stories to like
 All the pieces it was it was amazing. I love how we choreographed these events
 I hope you guys
 Realize how much time effort energy goes into that for how all the pieces go together
 How like one thing breaks the belief for the next thing and like so reason why people don't sit in the hall networking because they would miss the whole
 Story line like there's a and people like when you publish who those speakers are gonna be what time
 And I because I don't want you guys to I'm gonna go this one. I don't need that one
 I don't need Julie's freelancer secrets because I have my own business is like no you need like there's so many things she taught
 They're so essential to you understand the next piece of the puzzle
 And so that's why we're kind of more secret about who's speaking when they're speaking because I want people in for every single session
 Because they all build upon each other they're strategically placed in the way to give people the experience they need so
 That was the crazy day at number three if I'm not gonna lie
 tomorrow I'm gonna talk about day number four and there was some controversy day number four there's some crazy stuff
 There's some ups and downs and I'm gonna walk you through all that and
 And I'll tell you how many would have joined your comical bikes coaching program if you're interested so
 With that said if you haven't got your tickets for my life yet
 Seriously, what are you waiting for it's time to commit to make a covenant to yourself that you're gonna come and you're gonna
 Be part of this community because this tribe is community
 They're here to serve you support you they love you to care about you
 But you've got to make the leap of faith and come so that said go to funlhankinlive.com your tickets
