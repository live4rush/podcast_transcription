 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast today
 I'm in a huge van driving around Bear Lake and I want to share with you guys some thoughts because a lot of you right now are in the process of starting to publish
 Especially for the two comic club ex coaching program
 We have you all publishing podcasts and YouTube and blogs and a whole bunch of amazing things and my guests
 Not just my guests. I know this is true one of the biggest fears for most of you guys
 Including those who haven't started publishing yet
 Which is probably the reason why you haven't started publishing yet is because your fear about what people are gonna think about you
 What they're gonna say about you. So this episode if that's you and you feel that way this episode is for you
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so I want to come back to my goal with this episode
 so it's it's funny because
 Every time I tell someone to start publishing they start doing it the first thing that happens they get beat up right
 You start getting people commenting and usually the weirdest things it's like your friends and your family at first like why are you doing this?
 Why are you trying to grow?
 Why are you sharing like just go back into your little cave and just don't talk like you used to be because like we like you better that way
 That's the first wave of like the weirdness as you start putting yourself out there
 And I remember going through that back and 17-18 years ago now where people are like wait
 Why are you doing the things like stop?
 You know and then and then after that then as your voice starts getting louder and you start getting better and more people start fighting out
 You find this really weird thing number one if your neutral nothing happens and so it doesn't grow
 and so I want to
 Warn you again about that like neutrality while it may seem nicer and less less annoying
 It doesn't help it doesn't doesn't get your message out there and so
 If you really want to grow you start putting out there your your thoughts and your beliefs and your message and like you create that
 That polarity and that polarity does to one of two things number one is it it draws people to you right?
 The more polar you are the more people will be drawn to you
 But then the opposite side of polarity when something's pulling towards you is also the thing that pulls away from you
 And that's the people who are gonna freak out and not like you and I get people all the time like well
 It's usually for you Russell everyone loves Russell Brunson like oh, let me tell you so this was this episode's about I want to tell you
 That part of it
 so I've been on family vacation right now we're down at Bear Lake with my kids having a good time with my family and
 You know there's a lot more downtime here than I'm used to in my normal life my normal life
 It's like a wake up and I'm running until I pass out a night and that's like the that's kind of the pace that I set
 In fact, I felt so many like friends and co-workers and employees and people are just like man
 I do not know how you keep this pace up all the time
 But that's kind of my pace and I love it and it's like my normal thing so here at Bear Lake
 We're sitting at Lake and it's like there's no pace like we're on the sidelines just chilling and I'm like freaking out like
 Must run gotta create something. What do I do?
 And so a couple times I sneak my phone away and I started looking at stuff and I go through all the messages and everything
 And then I'm kind of done and so I spent some time going
 You know like when you have Instagram or Facebook
 There's like your messages that your friends and family send you but there's like an other tab of people who aren't your friends
 You they message you just kind of goes in there
 So if you want to find them you can so I decided to explore in the other tab
 And first off I want to warn you before you look in that tab if you think that the comments that are public
 are mean and brutal the comments on the other tab are even worse and
 And I want to caveat first off by saying that like I know people have a worse than me
 So I'm not gonna in fact. I've got a friend someone our ClickFunnels community who was showing me
 She gets men to men send her the most
 vulgar
 horrible things like
 The point where I would love to fly out and just take these people out anyway, so I don't get much of that
 Thankfully, so I do understand that that there's worse, but I just wanted to give you a snapshot of like the stuff
 I saw today
 because
 You know, it's kind of like that Adam Sandler movie was like you're all gonna laugh at you like yes
 They're gonna people laughing at you as you do this thing and they're gonna make fun of you and everything you say no matter
 How strong was Stan Jeff one way or the other people are going to attack you and it was just kind of it was just kind of
 Today was an interesting day to kind of see some of that stuff. So I'll share some of them
 so one of them was somebody I was posting pictures of
 You know my kids and me I'm family and vacation and this person
 Had been sending me messages and I realized that's how I looked in the other tab and started scrolling up for over a year
 Hundreds of messages talking to me about how horrible of a person I am that I have five kids and how I'm causing overpopulation
 And how I'm killing the world I'm killing things because I have these kids
 You know, you think like oh Russell you get this cute little family and your kids are so awesome and like your dad is trying
 Best to help raise them in the best way, you know all these kind of things was like no those people other side saying you are ruining the planet
 Because you have so many kids, right?
 This is the one where we had just gone to to waffle me up and we we took it
 We did take home because you know covid rules and you can't eat in the restaurant
 so they put him in these styrofoam bar not start from there like actually like cardboard box
 I don't know so brought him home. We're eating him and and I look at this thing and I
 went to the other folder and there's the message from some guy and I started reading it and there's
 Hundreds of messages of last two years of this person commenting on every single thing that I'm doing this destroying the environment
 Like talking about how the plastic forks were like how can you care about?
 You know these other causes when you're destroying the environment with your plastic forks and you're this thing and you're that thing
 And I had a picture of my Jeep
 I saw like a month earlier and it's like you're destroying the ozone layer of that Jeep like bullet and just like ripping on me
 How horrible a person I am because I use basic products, right like just stuff. There's that one, right?
 I'm trying to think of now. There's so many
 Oh with right now as time. I'm recording this. It's it's the world trafficking day, right?
 So I'm talking oh you are and about how we're saying how we're raising money and and you think like that should be a positive thing like
 Hey Russell, you're trying to save kids from sex slavery, right?
 Like that that's a noble cause like you should do that
 Okay, and you think that everybody in the world to be like yes Russell that is a good noble cause but it is not the case
 Instead what happens is there are so many people that are angry with me say oh what Russell?
 You're a white savior trying to save these little kids like blah blah blah
 I'm like thing after thing after thing like like why don't you care about people in your own hometown like there's problems happening in
 Your own town why do you have to go help people outside the country like this like anyway tons of negative around that and then I had other people who were
 yelling at me because
 Oh excited shared
 Germain's
 Germain Griggs post
 Who's a who's one of my black friends?
 He spoke for not to live and he made a really good post about just kind of you know his struggles with stuff
 So I posted that and some of you let me like why are you you're considering yourself with these kind of topics when there's kids being
 You know taking away from the sex slavery you should be focusing on those efforts and I'm like I literally am doing both
 Like I'm trying my best here and anyway, so
 And that's just like a small sprinkle like it was on and on every post I make
 As I see in this in my other folder I getting attacked by at least 10 to 15 people
 On everyone like no matter what I post positive negative family good things bad thing like you know
 Raising money for charity. I get the wrong charity. You're helping these people. You didn't do it right like on and on
 It's just it's it's crazy. So I'm sharing this with you guys because
 Yeah an earlier Russell 10 15 20 years ago when I was getting started this game a lot of this stuff would have been too hard for me to handle
 It would have been it would have been I probably would have stopped I would have said this you know it is not worth this
 But now that I've been doing this this long I've gotten pretty thick skin and and I care more about missions than the haters and the people
 They're talking against it and I understand that like there's so many so boxes so many things and the reality is I agree with almost all the people
 Right like yeah, I could like I should be doing more things for the environment
 Yes, I should be you know doing more things to help kids get a sex slavery. I'm doing my best
 I guess I should you know and like like everyone's platforms are good, but it's just it's it's when
 It's when people take you trying to focus on the platforms that you've chosen and
 Attacking you for those things because it's not the ones that they have and I just want to kind of remind all you guys
 Who are listening like first off is be aware of that in yourself right like if somebody if their mission is to?
 Help people in the anxiety or help entrepreneurs or help
 Kids or like whatever the thing is like like let them do their thing that could that's their colony
 That's what they were that's what their gifts were created for like that's what you know
 God called them to do that thing and so let them do that thing and be proud of me
 Even if it's different than the thing that you've been called to do just because you've been called for this mission and for that mission
 Doesn't mean you should be focusing on the opposite right or a young people because they're not folks on your mission and the thing
 You care about right the guy who's young me about having my car and having the plastic things like that's a great mission
 That's because calling it he should run with that but like cutting down other people because it's not their mission
 Shouldn't be shouldn't it isn't gonna help your mission grow right?
 It's like taking on the mantle taking extreme ownership of it and then running and giving and serving and doing the thing that you've been called to do
 Not criticizing people for following the the call rings and the missions that they've been called to do right?
 Kind of an example is that a mat Maddox who is you know Kayla Maddox is dad Matt's awesome
 He I actually shared a really cool podcast a couple weeks ago with you from him
 About the questions that he asked and it was anyway awesome podcast
 but Matt messaged me the day and his his mission that God called him to do is to work with
 Fatherless kids and people in the streets all sorts of stuff like that right and
 He shared all these things and was tagging me and everything and I messed up and said hey man like I love this
 I'm like it's not my calling okay
 My calling is around entrepreneurs and serve people through these charities that I've already that I've called you know like
 I focus on like man. I love you and I respect you and I support you because I know that's your mission
 I know what you're trying to do and it's like I will pay I'll give you money
 I'll give you time. I'll give you like I'll help support your mission
 But it's not my mission that's your mission right like I can't go all in I'm not gonna go spend the rest
 But I do it because it's not my mission
 These are the ones that I've been called to focus on but I support him
 And I love him and I'm grateful for him being the one who took the mantle and ran with those things right?
 And so I want you guys understand that like because it's funny most of people yelling at me. They weren't people
 You know who who didn't have good intentions. They did they just I don't know they just I want to attack my good intentions
 for whatever reason a couple other things that I noticed in there one was
 And this one is interesting if you guys know Rachel Hall if Rachel
 She's struggling right now just because her anyway
 I'm not gonna go into her for details by member
 She was telling me when to her first book came out gonna wash your face and Rachel is very Christian
 And she said it was funny is like the people that were they were closest to her right people that were other Christians
 Said other Christian women beat her up more than anybody else and say these are the people who like I was called to serve us trying to help
 And today the people that that like I was you know that I'm trying to help the people who are like me with ones who are the most
 You're most brutal and beat them beat her up the most and it's interesting
 I got a message in my other box again from some someone who
 Who's husband starts studying my things and she got nervous and so she started following me and following me Instagram
 And she's like because you know she's like I look at your account and you follow some people on Instagram who?
 Anyway, who she disagreed with and so she she forbid her husband from from
 Following me anymore because she didn't agree with some people that I follow on Instagram
 And I was like what so I was like so confused versus that went to my friends
 I don't have a ton of friends on Instagram looking and I'm scrolling through it
 And if you guys know what I do for my business obviously like I'm a marketing guy and I help market
 I help coach people in every market right so I can help tons of people in the financial markets
 and people in the health and fitness markets tons of people and supplement like all these different things
 so I follow the people that I coach and and and I also follow a lot of the
 Influencers and all these from spaces because I want to understand the markets so I can be a good coach and good mentor for these
 The people I work with right and so I'm looking through and like and like yes
 Some of the people I follow in health and fitness space like some of my clients and my friends like they post pictures of them flexing at
 competitions and and you know some of them are bikini contests and they they flex on stage these things and stuff like that
 And I was like like is that was negative or something else?
 I was looking at like the OUR and like there's there's Tim Ballard sharing, you know pictures of kids
 They've saved things like that. I'm like is that what I like I couldn't find what was so negative
 But she was so upset about someone who I was following
 Because of whatever again what I don't still understand the reason
 And and she was you know, she's like I'm an LDS so she's more of them like me
 She's like I'm just like you know, I can't believe another another LDS man would would follow these these people to my
 So I'm forbidding my husband to learn from you because of that. I'm just like I'm so confused like I
 It's just so it's just so hard. So I think
 You know a couple things number one for all of us listening stop judging each other
 Okay, everyone's here on a different mission different calling different thing
 They're trying to do love them support him
 Okay, number two quit judging people because of stupid stuff like judging me because I follow some of my friends and my clients on
 Instagram because I'm trying to coach them and help them and like show them how they can increase their ads and there's
 Things like that and judging me because you didn't like those people like that's so weird
 And so against everything that that I believe in and you believe in and we should all believe in
 And then the second side which is kind of the more focal point of this is just understanding it is like it happens to me
 It happens to everyone by the fact that you start talking and sharing and publishing stuff
 You're gonna get beat up a little bit and it's gonna be hard at first
 I would I would encourage you to try to delete things ignore them not don't don't rely upon it until your skin gets thicker and thicker because you're not careful
 It'll it'll it'll it'll stop you from continuing your mission, which is the biggest tragedy, right?
 You're here to try to change some people's lives
 And if the people that are fighting against you if they keep you from doing that
 Then they want and so
 While you're waiting while you're just getting your skin thicker
 It's just delete those things ignore them forget about them
 No focus on focus on the positives focus on the people that are giving the right messages
 focus on the things that that you know the positive reinforcements you get for your from your work and
 You know for me
 I take pictures on my phone of every single positive thing someone says about me and I have a folder
 I'm in my Google images and I have on vox I star all the ones that people send me positive feedback in those days
 I get beat up or I'm tired. I'm like, oh, why am I doing this?
 I go back and listen to my read them and those are things that fuel me keep moving forward
 So just be be aware of that it happens to the best of us for everything like for me having too many kids
 I get beat up for me using a plastic fork. I get beat up for me
 Following my friends on Instagram I get beat up for like for every little thing you're gonna get beat up
 So just ignore it because it doesn't matter. It's not them that matter
 It's the people that you are that are listening to you whose lives are being changed because of your message your mission and things
 You're putting out there. So keep doing it. Go stop. We need you. We need your voice. We need your message
 Your people are waiting to hear from you. So don't stop keep doing it and it'll be worth it in the end
 I promise you that all right. That said I appreciate you all. Thanks so much for listening for paying attention
