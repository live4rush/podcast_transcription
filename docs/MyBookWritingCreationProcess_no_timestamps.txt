 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome you to the marketing secrets podcast. I'm so excited to be with you here today
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody so first off I hope everything's been amazing in your lives and if you're struggling with anything then I
 Hope today. I'll help cheer you up a little bit. I'm feeling really really good right now. I shot my kids off school and
 And then me listening to crazy songs, which always always helps but right now
 I am in lockdown other than taking my kids to school where I am forcing myself to stay at home locked in a room to write my book
 And if any of you guys have ever written a book before you know
 There's a ton of pain associated with writing a book in fact is by far the hardest task I have ever done
 And so I had to literally force myself and lock myself in a room
 In fact, I'm gonna walk you through what's been happening since finlacking lives the fun like you live happened
 It was insane those years through there, you know those who weren't there you are gonna be there next year because you don't want to miss out again
 and
 Did a whole pod I'd share a bunch of podcasts kind of going through the last
 Everything happened falling like an eye the ups to downs the amazingness the such a such an amazing event
 And some of you guys have asked updates on Andy Andy was
 the guy that
 finlacking live Garrett kind of
 Brought on stage and he sent her to comic club X and everyone was freaked out nervous about him and it's fascinating
 In fact he messaged me because in there I talked about I said that he
 that he
 Had a his dad had a multi-million dollar business and stuff like that
 And he was probably gonna help him and and Andy messaged me. He's like he's like dude. I listen to your podcast
 He's like that's not true. I'm like what he means like he's like my dad is not helping me's like this is me
 I'm doing this myself. He's like it's like I put together t-shirt fun when I got home and
 T-shirt funnel made more than enough to cover the first month's payment
 It's like this month I'm working my next project which is gonna make even more and and he's doing it by himself
 And it's crazy what happens when when you're put in a state where you've got to be resourceful
 And he's figuring it out all by himself, which is which is super cool and proud of him for doing that
 I told him I said you go 2,500 bucks a month one is is not too shabby covered
 It covered the cost of coaching about my goals off you make 25 grand a month
 Or excuse me 2500 bucks a month is to make 25 grand a month and 250 thousand dollars a month and and then millions a month
 And to go from there and he's like that's what I'm talking about I want to do that
 So it's been fun watching him over the last 30 days instead of liking live watching him grow and then out from liking live
 And people ask them
 I was like why do you guys do fun liking live there be in the year and for me
 It's like first off
 There's just how to stress associated with it. I want to get over with it's like if I can just get this over with the beginning the year
 That'd be awesome
 But number two is like it's also like I feel like setting the tone for our entire community for the year
 And so I love bringing people together and we we get everybody moving and momentum happening
 At the very very beginning the year so we do it very early in the year
 But then after I can have over then usually I crash for like a day
 Which is about all I I was able to do and I was too excited about the next project and I built a whole training
 Lead funnels for my two common club exers and then a bunch of the cool stuff is happening then for us
 It was like okay now we had a plan our
 direction for the rest of the year and
 and so we flew out the entire marketing and
 Funnel building team and brought them here to Boise rented the Airbnb house and
 and and we did a week-long
 Event was really really cool getting us all focused and running in the right direction getting everybody kind of you know
 Focused on the goals and the plans for this year. It's what happened last week and my goal
 So me as no, I I've been running quite a few roles in my company. I am the CEO
 I'm also I will have been the head marketer plus the head content developer plus
 I'm doing like 25 people's jobs at once and and obviously I can't keep doing that and so this was really like
 a
 literal passing of the reins
 We brought Julie's story into be the VP of marketing and to run the marketing company the internal agency all kind of stuff
 and so
 This whole that whole week was about me kind of casting the vision and then handing the reins to her and the team and now
 They're running and it's really fun to see
 And then I said basically after this events over I'm locking myself in a room
 For three months and I'm writing the traffic seekers book as well as updating the dot-com seekers and expert secrets
 We're putting together like a hardbound trilogy and
 So I'm basically rewriting two books and and writing the third book and so yesterday was the first day and it's funny kids
 Everyone's like how much did you get written? I was like well no words
 But I created the outline and I did a really cool way
 So I'm gonna give you guys this is an idea
 So I built the outline out in Trello where I basically had to call them for each book
 So the doc on secrets expert secrets and traffic secrets book and then I made a card for each chapter
 And so the first two books obviously already been written and then the third book was news
 Then I wrote out but the problem this is the problem is like there's a bunch of foundational stuff that people need to own traffic secrets that they don't
 That I didn't want to include in traffic secrets
 It doesn't make sense there are things that I wanted to include in dot-com seekers and expert secrets
 And so I went back to those outlines. I've been trellised like okay
 I need to add a section on Hook Story to offer and probably three chapters and hook story offer
 Into the doc on seekers books
 That's where this part needs to be and then I need to add this part into the expert seekers book
 I need to I need to be shifting these like adding some things and moving some things around
 And so I spent all the yesterday kind of rebuilding out the outlines of the three book looking at them now this time
 So just three three separate books, but well, you'll see when we launched this later on this year
 But they're gonna be a box set where they all come together
 So when they come together it's like now that we have them this one thing
 I can like cross roughness between the two and take somebody from here to there and and so I'm trying to with you know
 Inside that context like hey now that I know I can add hook story offer to trap or to doc on secrets
 I could add this to experts to just not talk with those in traffic secrets
 I can reference them and now I have all these three books together. So it's been really fascinating because I've been
 Basically building you know building the frameworks these three books together
 And so yesterday did that all day and then I recorded it and said videos to
 Some people my team and some friends just to get their feedback and ideas which has been really cool as well
 But now I feel like I have the framework done
 And so this morning I woke up early and
 The pre-fast pre-face how we say that the pre-face for all three books was basically me talking about three books fit in together
 And so it's been fun this morning
 So I'm gonna drop making diagram of like this is this is what you learn in doc on secrets and boom
 There's a doodle and they're like and then this is what expert secrets was then on top of the doodle
 It's like boom the next phase of it
 Which is you know learning how to persuade and sell people things and and build a tribe and things like that
 And then the third book it lays on top and I boom
 Here's how you fill these funnels how you build the value out and you move people up and through it and so
 So much so much fun. So I'm doing this morning is doodling out those things and putting them together into an actual framework
 And so that's not been working on it's been so much fun and so
 I'm excited I start my kids off and go back in and lock myself down for the next like 10 hour
 weights as the weights in 15 minutes and then lock myself down for like next 10 hours and keep working on the book so
 Anyway, it's it's exciting and so
 Why did I tell you this partially because I just want to talk about out loud and partially because
 Some of you guys always ask about the process like how do you do it Russell?
 How does it work and you know for me? There's the process of the year, right?
 It's fun locking live kicks off the community and then it's like our marketing retreat which kicks off the direction for the year and
 Internally inside the company and then this is like me laying out the framework for the books how they work together
 It's interesting like I used to always write the table contents just in
 You know Microsoft Word or Google Docs and it's tough because like I've been writing this book on my page 300
 I'm like, I don't like how this fits
 I need to shift them something around I scroll up the inner page look table contents like scroll back down 300 pages back
 It's like it's really hard to change things
 And I realized really quick that I'm complaining about how hard is to edit things in Google Docs
 Which is like the easiest thing in the world where some people back in the day they wrote books on a typewriter a typewriter
 How do people do that?
 Go we're blessed today and then pretty typewriter people writing them by hand and then they had like you know going like set the the print
 You know letter by letter and then stamp and ink and stamp into a book like anyway, we are so blessed
 I don't know how people wrote books back in the you know
 Early 1800s or 1500s or before Christ like how do people write books? I don't I don't know
 It's hard enough nowadays and we got all this amazing technology
 But anyway, I digress the reason why I'm sharing that is because like this concept of like outlining in Trello is amazing
 Because I can move chapters around by moving up down up down and then as you write a book or you create a course
 There's always interdependencies right like there's always been a big pain in the other books that I'd be explaining something
 I'm like oh crap. I haven't explained this yet
 So I can't talk about this I have to go back two chapters earlier and talk about this thing so that
 Vanished stood it over here and like there's this whole chicken the egg thing. That's really
 It's a lot of work. What's cool is in Trello the way I'm doing this is like each card becomes a
 Chapter in the book so I can have it from top to bottom so I can see the table contents in Trello
 And if I like oh I could move things around I can just drag and drop move things around and make sure that the
 Logical sequencing event makes perfect sense right and then inside each car then I can like outline what's come when I'm talking about each chapter
 So outline those things and then I'm able to see before I start writing all the interdependencies like oh I have to have this
 I've talked about this or this makes no sense. I talk like this or this makes no sense and boom boom boom back and forth back and forth
 And so that's kind of my goal my process today. So yesterday I spent the entire day writing just outlining the chapters
 of the three books and
 Again, it makes it like a simple task. What took like the entire day today?
 I'm gonna be going in and outlining out what's gonna be happening in each
 In each chapter to make sure all the interdependencies work and so that the flow works and then I gotta you know in that outline
 I'd be like okay, you know in the card in this chapter like what are all the different stories?
 I'm gonna tell this story. I tell this story. I gotta make sure I explain this case study
 I got this case study and it's just kind of a big
 Anyway, it's gonna be it's gonna be fun. That's kind of the game plan
 So and then from there then I'll actually start writing so Wednesday tomorrow. I'll actually start pen to paper typing words
 So exciting so that's my process
 That's how I'm doing it and it's um, it's working really good so far
 So I hope to help some of you guys who are treating content or courses or whatever. So all right, that's it
 I'm gonna head in I get to work
 I got I got I got I got a word shred. I got a mission to create. I got a book to to
