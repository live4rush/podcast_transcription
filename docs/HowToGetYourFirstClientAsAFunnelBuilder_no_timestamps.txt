 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to marketing seekers podcast today
 I'm excited we actually asked you guys on Instagram what you wanted me to talk about on the podcast and we got back
 40 different responses were actually really really good
 So I've got the next 40 episodes lined out and I just can but I do have a bunch that want to share and so today's question
 I'm gonna be answering is how to get your first client as a funnel builder
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, so as you guys know, I am a big fan of funnel building
 I think that everybody should start in this industry
 Building funnels for the people because that's the skill set everyone's got to learn and the better you get at it
 the more valuable your skills that becomes right and
 By funnel building I know it's me just building a funnel like you get a good all aspects of it
 You gotta get good at writing copy and doing the funnel and the headline and connecting things and the graphic design and all the different pieces right?
 Because you got to learn it initially
 Hopefully on somebody else's time. That's what's nice up being the funnel builder
 someone hires you and you go and you build a funnel for them and they pay you and and you do that and you keep
 Getting better and you get better and you like hone your skill and you craft your your skill sets get better and better your copy gets better
 Your funnels get better your designs get better like all the things get better and better and better
 And during that process as you keep getting better
 Hopefully you have some idea for a product or service you can sell and now you got this funnel skill set that's already
 Dowed and perfected it's it's ready and then you can plug in whatever products or receive have and now you can quit being a
 Funnel builder for other people and you now a funnel builder for yourself
 That's the path I would do if I was to start over again
 And so I think this question is really really good and the question
 Once again was how do you get your very first client as a funnel builder? So what I would do
 And I kind of did this when I decided I wanted to launch my inner circle coaching program
 So he has heard me tell the story before I didn't just go out there and like launch the program
 I thought I got to go improve that I'm actually awesome at this process that I'm teaching that I want to teach people that I'm doing right
 It's the first thing for me is I figure I go who is my dream client
 I was like my dream client our successful entrepreneurs who need to grow their company with a sales funnel and started looking like well
 Who like who would be my dream person?
 If I could go and pick a client like that's my client
 That's person I want to work for and I was at the time
 I was really big into juicing and Drew can only was this guy who I had seen Facebook a lot
 He seemed really awesome
 I saw his business and it was good and I was like I think I can help and so I literally went to Drew and I
 volunteered to work for him for free and then
 You know we I helped them I consulted them but we helped him build and launched there organ if I funnel
 They launched it and the rest is history right and I was unable to deliver that story to go and get a whole bunch
 People that joined my inner circle if I was gonna go and become a funnel builder
 I would literally do these acts and things I would decide what type of business do I want to build funnels for now?
 If it was me, I'm passionate about like authors and speakers and things like that
 So I'd be like I'm passionate about authors
 So I'm gonna go find something's got a book
 I'm gonna build my book funnel right or maybe you're passionate about something different
 Maybe you're passionate about chiropractors or dentists or plastic surgeons or whatever right so I would go when I would find that
 The person who is your dream client like who you would love to have 10 or 20 or 50 or 100 of those people
 And you want to be the fun able to deliver all of them and then find one of them and then go and work for free
 Go and find that person to be a case today
 So go find the dentist down the street and say hey, I'm gonna build out your entire funnel for you
 So I can cost you penny
 I just need you to help you know
 Let me record you for some videos and some things I need or whatever and go in and do the work for free
 Right do it for somebody for free build the case study prove
 You know what you're doing and if you can do that you take this dentist you launch the campaign you get point
 You're bringing in five new leads a day off Facebook ads to the little funnel landing page and blah blah blah whatever it is
 Now I have a case study. I take that case study and go to 500 other dentists today. Okay
 Let me show you a really quick process
 I put together that gets my local dentist an extra five new clients today
 And how I can do it for you as well
 And then I go directly to the 500 dentists and I showed them that campaign
 Hey, I did this for you
 I did this over here to want me to do it for you too
 Do you want me to do it for you too? And if I send to 500 people guess what?
 I'm probably gonna get 50 the respawn and from the 50 the respawn probably get 10
 They give me money and now my own case study turned into 10 paying clients. And so that's how I'd get my very first
 Job as a funnel builder find out who is my dream client?
 I go find one of those people
 I would go work my face off for free and give and serve and work and do everything I can to make sure that person successful
 I then take that case study show it to the rest of my dream clients and from there
 It's just the lay down cell like they're just lining up and buying all day
 Literally after I got my Drew Canolei testimonial video coming back from Drew like this is what I did for Drew's company
 He's like
 my company changed thanks to Russell
 I showed that out there and boom launching a circle and now I've got you know one of the largest and the most expensive
 Mashman programs in the world because I built it off of the case study of my dream client
 And so that's what I would do hope that helps for any new funnel builders or honestly
 This is also the same process I do for almost anything by selling a course gets our dude
 I would find a group of people I take into the course give an amazing result and then that would become the case study
 I would use to sell the course if I was selling a physical product guess what I would do take the physical product
 Give it a couple people build a case study off of it case study becomes a sales video and sell people like it's the same process, right?
 It's it's results in advances. It's proving that what you can do actually works for somebody besides yourself
 And that's kind of the best way to do it
 So hopefully helps any of you guys who are first-time funnel builders who are trying to build a funnel figuring out how you can do it
 But hopefully it helps all of you guys no matter what you're selling is go and get the case study first
 And that's the best way to grow your business. Thanks again guys. Hope you hope this helps and keep sending your questions
