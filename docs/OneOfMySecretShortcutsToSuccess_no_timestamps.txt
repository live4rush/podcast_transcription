 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast today
 I am streaming to you from an amazing cabin out on a lake with my family and
 As I've been sitting here just thinking away from my computer for a while
 I started some realizations about one of the biggest keys to help me get success initially
 That I forgot about and I'm watching some people who have been using this strategy in this concept strategically to grow their companies quickly
 So I want to share with you some of my thoughts
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 Alright, so when I first got started in this this whole game, right and
 It was interesting because I didn't have
 You know we talk a lot about resources versus resourcefulness that didn't have any resources
 My wife at the time is making 915 hour
 I had no job as a wrestler and we're living in a apartment that was like four hundred seventy five dollars a month between that and
 And grocery money like the 915 hours she's making did not go far
 So we didn't have any resources right so I get it when people are like I don't have the money
 I don't have the resource like I was there and so for me though and this is before
 Before Facebook as you for all these things. I was like how many me successful
 And so I started doing and I didn't call it dream 100 at the time
 But literally we were going through and finding dream when I had a partner
 I was looking at the people I was like following all the people in the market that I wanted to be in and I
 I was just so fascinated by them
 I looked at what they were doing how they were doing the products they created what they were launching like was on all their email list
 I like read every email I sent out I
 This is before podcasting even if they were to podcast I would listen to them
 But back then we did tell seminars
 I would get all the tell seminars
 I was just like I was watching everyone was doing and I was like immersing myself in this market trying to understand trying to get my finger
 On the pulse of what was happening and why I was happening and who were the players?
 And what were they doing and and why were these guys's products doing so well?
 I'm like what were the different hooks and the angles they use and they just I don't know just watching and I was mesmerizing
 I remember I feel like I like step into this world with all these producers
 All these people making tons of money and I was just like a little kidney candy store just watching and observing
 I remember looking at all these things and just thinking like man like how
 Like I don't know what to create. I don't want to do I don't have any ideas
 I'm a creative, you know, but I was watching them and as I see people doing different things
 I started getting ideas and it's funny because I think so many of us nowadays we have ideas for for a product
 And so we go and we create this product and we create it
 You know the thought I'm gonna create it and go sell this in my product for whatever reason that wasn't my my initial concept
 was always like what can I create with that person any part of it is because I
 Have like the hero factor as idolizing more even on college
 Just like there's these gurus were so cool. How cool would be to work with them?
 And so as I started creating such an idea
 My first few projects were all like I never thought I'm like let me create a product have this person promoted
 It was like how do I create something with that person and so I'd go back and I'd pitch him like hey
 Like you're really good at this thing. What if we create the same together?
 You know and like that became these things that I was trying to come to the table with something amazing
 I thought you know if I did all the work and I don't have you lifting and I gave it to him
 They would promote it and it would be win-win and so I was in the role of like I'm gonna do hundreds of the work
 They're gonna do nothing
 But I'm gonna leverage their name and their credibility and their list and so one example
 One of the guys who I studied a lot at the very beginning was a guy named Alex Mendozaan and Alex is a genius
 And I remember a time he had this course called
 We had a bunch of course they tell some of our secrets in a postcard
 Things called postcardmarketing.com or something like that
 I don't know it was a post postcard course about same time
 There was this there was a network marketing program coming out called send out cards and I was like oh my gosh
 Alex needs to send out cards. He's teach people postcard marketing. This is a tool that worked that way and so I was like
 I was like I want to create something with Alex that'll get people into this thing and so
 I went through and create an idea for it and I was like here's the project
 Here's the idea here's that I mapped it all out and I you know took me a while to get a hold of him get through all this
 Gatekey was finally pitched it to him
 I was like here it is and we're at the end of he's like well
 What's in it for you? And I'm like dude
 I just wanted to do this project with you keep all the money out of your care
 like I just want you to promote it and like if we get my name next years and you know and
 And luckily he eventually said yes, and I killed myself on this project and
 That probably the best example except project ended up going anywhere
 But that's how working I did that over and over and over again. It's like all my early projects
 They were their co-branded I found someone who was already successful who had something I brought something else to table
 I did all the work and they just promoted it and
 And that was kind of the thing and I was able to leverage their credibility and their things and it was awesome and
 For a long time. That's how I started growing my company
 I was piggybacking on the back so I was other people and I was co-branding products together
 I do all the work slept their name on it and it was amazing
 I remember I came out with a product called RSS Otteries or RSS generator and at a time arm and more have like 20 different
 generator products remember I created this whole product spent a ton of money energy but I
 Really expensive and I remember designing the site and all of arm and sites the time had his head
 Up at the top so I had the site designed with his head in my head on top and I'm ever bringing it to him like hey
 Do you want to add another product to product lanes like what do you mean?
 I'm like well you have all these you know e-cover generator heterogenerator
 But voila, how would you like to own RSS generator?
 And I said go check out the site and you went to the site and there's the pitch the site done his finish is brand
 His head on and my head on everything and he's like dude. That's amazing
 I'm like do I partner I was like sure and I remember the next big seminar he promoted from say
 It's this new project that me and Russell been working on called RSS Otteries sponsor
 It's crazy, you know right now
 We're trying to we are about a week away from launching a big project with Tony Robbins and it's this new software we created
 it's insanely cool and
 It's kind of same thing we built the whole thing and came to Tony like hey this thing's done
 Do you want to be part of it? He's like yes, and so now it's Russell Dean and Tony's software and and
 And Cody didn't do anything right, but he used to show up because his name on it and we leveraged his credibility
 He's listed it's you know, it'll be arguably the greatest launch in the history of the world, right?
 And so I get into this damn still doing it
 I start looking like some of the people who've come into the ClickFunnels world who are really really smart right Jim Edwards
 Is a good example of it Jim came and he could have easily came to me and said hey Russell
 I have this software that the right scripts for people you should sell to your last night
 I would have said no, but steady-candy came to me said hey have an idea
 I have all this cool software
 what if we made a new version for you and I'm gonna use your scripts from your books and we're gonna build this thing and
 And we'll call it funnel scripts and they keep pitching me on this idea and I was like what I need to do is like nothing
 I will do all the work all the effort all the everything all you do is you got to put your name on it and sell it with me
 And I was like done and so we did that and looking now it's been
 It's been what three or four years since funnel scripts first came out and that one product alone his hit two comma club X
 Jim makes a lot of money every single month and and he did all the work for it
 But he came and co-branded it with me and and it's this thing now that we sell every single day like consistently
 It's it's in and of itself is a huge business just this one thing
 But he was able to come to us and kind of leverage our credibility, you know and
 And I think that if you start thinking about things that way especially if you can start instead like just I'm gonna create a product
 I'm gonna go drive Facebook ads of that like how do you how do you latch on to people already have the credibility already have these things
 How do you co-brand something together?
 There's no there's no rules you make anything you want like another good example inside of two comma club X coaching program
 We're building out having everybody do these summit funnels and so we're launching new company
 With the students to show them like in real time this whole thing happening
 And so we're doing a summit just like them and and we're asking people when we got somebody
 Who we approached to be part of something there's a million person list and they're like oh we can we can be part of summit
 But you know rock and promote I'm like what it takes you to promote like I don't know what do you have and so
 We came back to the wall instead of paying 50% commission will pay to 100% commission
 Instead of this what if we do this and like we gave them everything and they're like done
 And now we got something who's got a million person list
 He's gonna be promoting our summit which is insane right and so but we had to renegotiate figure it out
 I'm like wasn't so much it was co-branded
 But but same thing we're like leveraging their credibility and giving them whatever it takes okay
 I have friends in the past who have gone to affiliates and said you'll promote my product
 Well co-branded I'll give you a hundred percent of the commission. Oh in fact, okay. Here's another funny
 Sorry the story was kind of funny one. Some of you guys know who Logan Paul is
 I'm not gonna be in my opinion on him or it or anything
 But he posted on Twitter that day that he'd give $10,000 any influencer who could be even wrestling match and so obviously I was like dude
 So Rumbaka said I'll give you a hundred grand if
 If you wrestle me in if if you win and if I lose
 Or excuse me. I'll give you a hundred grand if you win and if and if I win I'll give a hundred grand a charity
 To owe you are and so I'm putting out there and some fun. I'm texting back and forth
 I'm trying to set this huge wrestling match with with Logan Paul and it's funny because if you don't know Logan
 He's got like 20 million followers on YouTube. He's got 18 million on Instagram all these things and
 It was funny. We're kind of negotiating instinct which I'm hoping happens cross your fingers it happens
 But we're going back and forth and and he was asking me like well, what's in it for you like what's like
 You guys I was like literally I'll pay you a hundred grand win lose or draw just like let's do this thing
 I'll pay a hundred grand. I'll donate money check. I don't care
 He's like what's in it for you? I'm like dude
 So for me is I get a wrestle Logan Paul like that's gonna be on a YouTube channel for your 20 million people you can Instagram it like
 Like I'm just leveraging for credibility. I'm like I was like you can sell tickets this thing keep on 100% of money
 I got one zero dollars from it like I'm just leveraging you and your credibility your personality to bring more people into my world, right?
 and I think that
 So I don't know I just want you guys start thinking that way
 I think so many of us think about the short term like how do we make an immediate ROI and say no
 Don't worry about that. I got my gonna make any money off my Logan Paul wrestling match right?
 I'll lose my I'll give money away, but it gives me publicity
 It attaches my name to this thing
 I like does all these things now if I'm able to pull it off that will in the long term make me insane amount some money
 That's what I'm looking for I'm looking for these partnerships
 So think about that as you're as you're building your businesses think about
 The projects you have think about the ecosystem you're in who are the influencers who are the people have the list who are the people that power to have money to have
 Connections that have like these things what can you create instead of getting them prone as affiliate?
 We can create you can co-brand and let them be part of it, right?
 We you do all the work they slap their name on it
 They promote their list and you split the money
 Maybe I'll split 50 maybe it's 90 10 like whatever they take less money, but then you're building your list your credibility your reputation
 Like all those things, you know in the short term if you looked at most those really projects
 I did the co-branded projects
 Most of them from the house that look like failures, right?
 But it gives the compounding over a decade. It's like this one led list just like list it's like list every single time
 It introduces me and my personality my brand to new segment the market new segment to eventually it's like
 And I see this guy everywhere right I see Russell everywhere. I mean there I felt that before I see Russell everywhere
 I open up my phone and he's where I go he's there
 It's because I am I'm there on podcast news and then on ads and there on you know
 Many things I can hopefully I'll be there on a wrestling match like all the things and that's kind of the goal
 So and hope that helps
