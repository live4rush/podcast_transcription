 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome to marketing seekers podcast. I am super excited to have you guys here today
 This episode is for those of you guys who have the haters or the people
 Who are talking trash about you as you try to share your message and if you haven't had it yet
 The more aggressive you are the more you care about what you say and the louder you put it out there
 The louder the noise will come back and so this episode
 I want to entitle the phase where you find out if you really believe your message is true
 So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own
 Pocket how do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 Alright everybody, so I'm excited for this episode
 This is one that comes on the back of two weeks of the internet being really really mean
 So it's funny because I've been doing this now for almost 15 years and I've got pretty thick skin and I don't let too much bother me
 Because I believe so much in my message and I believe when I'm doing what I'm saying
 So I don't really care about the naysayers
 In fact typically my my mental response when I see people talk trashes man
 Their life must be miserable like
 It got the owners that they could be angry about this this thing that I'm trying to share put out there and
 That helps me get through it through most of it
 But the last two weeks has been it's been interesting. I told my team three or four times like man the Internet is me in this week
 And it actually started prior to to me it started initially with with Tony Robbins
 A lot of you has no Tony's been you know big inside the ClickFunce community spoken to fun hacking live events
 We just did the mastermind calm launch with him and you know a bunch of other things and just someone who I have so much love and respect for
 And like two weeks ago Buzzfeed aka the garbage of the Internet. It's like literally the national inquire of the Internet
 But worse
 Roto Smirr article about him not based on facts or reality
 In fact all the people that they they misquoted are coming out putting videos like I never said that like that's like
 the exact opposite what I said and just it's just ridiculous that anyway, so they post this huge thing and
 You know and because Buzzfeed is big they got all attraction with it
 but they're they're looking at clickbait and trying to get people to click on buttons and and
 read and
 Anyway, it was just it was frustrating for someone like Tony
 I mean for me to see you know friend like Tony have to go through that
 And I posted a big thing on my Facebook wall
 They kind of you know told my effect. Maybe I should read that really quick just so you guys get my my opinion cuz I'm sure some of you guys
 Have wonder like what was my my feedback someone who actually knows Tony and and
 You know at a personal level like what the what the actual feedback was so I'm pulling it up right now
 And I will read it to you
 If I'm able to find it. I said
 I've had a ton of my friends in the past 40 hours messaging me asking my opinion about Buzzfeed article about Tony Robbins
 So I thought I post my thoughts here for everyone to see first off Buzzfeed is trash
 They're the national inquiry of the internet if you understand their business model and you know
 Then you know they will do anything including trying to destroy people's lives for a click if you've read one of my favorite books
 Trust me. I'm lying by Ryan holiday
 You know how easily online media is manipulated and yes
 You really should read this book especially if you're marketer
 But even more or so if you if you want to understand how you're being marketed to in the media and then linked to Amazon to the trust me
 I'm lying book which he has all should read it is so good
 Anyway second Tony's done more to change people's lives than almost anyone who's ever lived in this earth
 I've had a chance to be friends with him now for over a decade. I've seen him on stage
 I've seen him in private and I know his heart
 He's changed my life save my marriage and as someone I consider not just a mentor
 But a friend you read his response the article here
 No, I had recommend only reading his response not the garbage that they posted so if you go to medium.com Tony posted a letter
 An article called an open letter to Buzzfeed editors
 Third I saw Instagram today from Tim Ballard founder of Operation Network on railroad
 That was one of the most powerful testimonies about Tony in the situation
 Please spend the time minutes to watch this full video - if you go to Instagram Tim Ballard posted something about how like he's like literally we for a living
 Research and trying to find sex, you know people have sex crimes and then we prosecute him
 And he's like we work with Tony to fight this and he's like anyway, just as it was really good
 Anyway, I'll end with something I heard Tony say the first time I saw him speak and he said there are two ways to build the largest building in town
 Number one actually build the largest building or number two tried knock down all the other buildings around you to make you look taller
 Buzzfeed's attempt to try to knock down the lives of people who serve the most isn't gonna make them the tallest building
 Isn't gonna make them the tallest building for them and for anyone else reading give back to work on yourself and do the work
 I'm trying to build the best version of yourself. So that was my my my post
 And then it feels like the internet was like all right Russell if you're gonna defend him
 We're gonna we're gonna try to tear you down as well
 For most part everyone posted really good good comments, which was which was awesome, but it's just interesting because
 Yeah, it's just anyway, so
 So after that though, it's been funny again
 I get so I get positive negatives all the time
 It doesn't typically bother me but I had one that was posted by someone who I thought was a friend and appear and so
 I've said a lot of business to you and
 Anyway, it was just kind of crazy and he posted this big post basically saying that like the messaging I share about being one funnel way is
 Is misleading to people because they all think that they just have to throw up a thing and whatever
 It's kind of talking trash and honestly, I feel that he was
 Taking cheap shots at me to be able to sell more people into the agency, which is super annoying
 But whatever people can't actually drive traffic themselves then it is a good tactic. It's funny back in the day
 The way that that the people who weren't able to provide value on their own would get leads they would go and they would
 Rank in Google for like Russell Brunson scam and then everyone type my name in there was a scam
 They click on like Russell not actually a scam, but you should hire you should buy my product instead
 It's like the lowest form of market. It's like when you have no creativity and that's what you do
 And that's what this guy kind of did basically saying anyway
 It's funny because of all the posts he's ever posted this this one's got the most attention because all my funnel hackers
 You know him came in and like defending me, which was awesome. So I appreciate that
 But it's just knowing because someone who I thought was again. I thought it was a peer and a friend anyway
 I'm not gonna
 anyway, whatever so
 but basically was attacking me and my message and and saying that he didn't think it was good from the marketplace and I
 Shouldn't be able to talk about those things and just
 Yeah, so we kind of put that out there, which is which is super annoying and you know everyone's in there defending me
 It's people fighting people saying yeah, you know, they don't like my message
 Whatever and then I just posted my I made one response. I left it there
 So I'm gonna read you my response because it comes back to what I want the point of this podcast to be
 I said my message has never been your first funnel is gonna be successful. It's consistently for
 For years that you're just one funnel way that you don't know which one it is
 So you need to keep building and trying until you find it personally
 It took me 21 funnels before I made my first seven figure funnel
 It took me six funnels before the click funnels hit the click phones one hit and blew up
 I'll keep beating this drum as long as I have a voice because I believe the message is true
 And the three point five billion dollars are customers have processed in the last four years helps me to prove that it is
 The only thing that keep that keep the only thing that keeps
 Can't be mown writing the only thing that keep them back our belief and the skills and kill myself to give them both
 I'm grateful through all you playing people's successful campaigns blog
 I will say his name just wish you went to rocks people that are trying to develop your future dream clients
 So basically my message to him was just like look I believe this message to choose
 I'm gonna keep on beating that drum as long as I have a voice because I know it's true
 and
 Yeah, and so
 And that's funny
 This week also Stephen Larson messaged me privately. He was just like hey man
 He's like the internet's been really mean this week
 I know and he was talking about some places he's gonna beat up out and he said, you know
 It's funny because he said I'm gonna title this one face to noise
 I said no you need to title some face to do I really believe my message because this is what happens
 I'm just gonna share some of all you guys because if you haven't had it happen yet you will
 You get excited about this thing, right?
 You want to become an expert you want to put your opinions and your voice and your thing out there
 You come out and you start sharing it what happens immediately is you get a little bit kickback, right?
 Like use your friends your family like oh why is he sharing this?
 Why are she sharing this like you know and there's that that weirdness right there?
 And a lot of people don't make it past that they just give up and go back to their real world
 But for those of you who have persevered past that you got past the friends and family and people you love kind of tearing you down
 You've got your message out there and start to see some success and you you've had the chance to like affect somebody you changed their life
 And you're like oh my gosh, this is amazing and then you get that high from that
 You're like I want to do it again
 I want to do it again
 You start trying to help you start trying to grow it and what will inevitably always happen is as you make more noise as you
 increase your visibility and try more more success
 the the opposition will come harder at you and
 You know what Steven's going through now
 He's the year and a half into his business and he's you know making as much noise as possible and it's been so much fun watching him
 But you know when you're making that much noise the opposition will start coming harder and and
 And the second phase which is what he's going through right now is where you really find out how much you believe in your message
 Because as then as the external noise is the people who are against who are fighting your message get louder and louder and louder
 You have to turn back at yourself and say do I really believe this is this really what I want to dedicate my
 life to is it really worth doing do I really want to keep beating this drum and
 A lot of people at that point the noise gets too loud and they step away
 so many people who I know who who could have or should have been great leaders and and
 could have could have you know changed so many people's life stopped because they they heard the
 opposition I think I sold out they couldn't they couldn't they couldn't handle it and so what I want to share with you guys and
 But I hope helps you because I've had a chance to go through this a lot in the last 15 years doing this
 And sometimes it's louder than others, but it's always loud and it's always a lot
 Is just you you have to really believe in your message and if you don't it's gonna
 It's gonna be easy to step back
 But if you look at yourself and say look is what I'm saying do I believe this is it truth?
 Is it actually is it the thing and if it is then you've got to commit and you've got to double and triple down
 So I'm gonna turn off the noise. I'm gonna block the people. I'm an unfriend and unsubscribe from them
 I'm gonna get set up gatekeepers and and support people and boundaries to make sure that I'm protected at all costs
 But when things slip through and I see them I need to believe so much of my message that it doesn't matter
 Okay, my message back to this guy
 again was
 Was um, I'm gonna keep beating this drum as long as I have a voice because I believe the message is true
 Like that's my message for you guys if you really believe in your message
 You have to keep beating that drum and keep beating it because the opposition
 Will not stop and the only way to drown out the noise of the people attacking you is to beat that drum louder and louder and louder to the point
 where they
 It gets so loud that you can't hear them and for me
 That's the most point where I'm at right now
 I just keep beating it and I believe in it and I keep doing it it's making more noise
 I'm gonna keep on doing it and I'm hopefully that gives you guys encourage as well
 The bigger you get it doesn't mean you're gonna get less people taking shots at you means you're gonna get more
 But if you're beating the drum loud enough, it's not gonna matter they'll bounce off you need to keep going so
 For those of you who are going through that phase right now or you know, what's coming in the very near future
 Now is the time to really double down on your message and look at it and believe it
 And if you're if you're if you're wavering it like is this really the right message?
 I'd be doing this or any change like go out there to serve more people help more people
 Like I told him you know the three point five billion dollars our customers a process
 Show me this is true and I walk up and down the bathroom hallway or the kitchens in my office here
 I see all the two common club boards and two common club ex-awards
 I know that my message is true because I know I've seen it work over and over and over again
 And my absolute belief in it is what gives me the ability to continue to beat my drum and continue to beat it
 Because I care about the people I'm serving I care about their success
 And so the same thing's got to be true for you
 so my goal for you is to take that same mindset right now and just drill into yourself because
 The opposition will come I promise you that and if it doesn't it means that you're not you're not
 Yeah, it'll come
 I promise you that as you start having success it'll come. So just be prepared for it when it comes
 Like celebrate it
 Don't you know don't be upset by it by it because that'll just pull you down
 It'll make you know I want to keep beating your drum just shift focus back the people you're serving keep on beating your drum
 So that's the guy for you guys today
 I'm grateful for all of you as you listen. I hope that this gives you some inspiration gives you that
 Whatever you need to keep moving forward
 Because your message matters and what you do
 It's important not just important to you and to your family to the your income
 It's important to people you can call to serve so don't stop keep beating your drum keep going out there and doing your thing
 And I'm on your side. I'm sitting here next you beating your drum with you
 Because I care about you or respect you I'm grateful for you and grateful for the contribution you're making the world
 Keep doing it don't stop keep beating that drum
