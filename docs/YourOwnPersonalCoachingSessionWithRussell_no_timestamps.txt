 Hey everyone, this is Russell. Welcome to a camping edition of the marketing seekers podcast.
 So the big question is this.
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable.
 That is the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers.
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing Secrets.
 Hey guys, I want to do a really special podcast today because I think for some reason a lot of people thought this whole
 entrepreneurship business is gonna be easy and
 There's been they're gonna get rich quick and all type of things and the reality is
 It's hard. It's really hard. Especially the first two or three years. You got to find your voice
 You got to create a brand you got to build a moment you're create products
 People actually want you to figure out what is your selling and how to sell it yet?
 There's a lot that goes into initially and I think that sometimes we get seduced by how quick and easy because
 You know overnight success stories between making million dollars in five months
 come on the back of three or four years of of work and effort and in time and recently one of our
 coaching clients
 They've been struggling and as I kind of saw they were doing the motions
 But they were having success and I realized that the reasons that for the time and ahead of time and my son of a boxer
 It was about a 15 minute box message
 They kind of went over this and I've edited out from that message all the stuff that relates to them because it doesn't matter who they are
 But it was messages
 I think everybody needs to hear and should hear because you have to realize that there's a lot that goes into it and sure
 Maybe there's other businesses you can start maybe you can go start an Amazon business or things like that
 We just did byproduct post it and that's how it is
 But if you want to be a leader you want to be an expert you want to change the world
 It takes some time you think about people go to school for
 Four eight six ten twelve years to try to get a job that pays them fifty to hundred grand a year
 Like you're trying to make become a multi-millionaire. You think it's gonna happen overnight
 Like it takes the energy so only is listen this boxer and just hopefully it's a coaching call for you and think about
 That effort you got to put into it
 Think about the team you need to build think about who you need to become to have those huge successes
 No, this thing I talk about a couple people
 I've mentioned Anthony and talk about Anthony and D Clemente by backing secrets talk about Kaitlyn and talk about
 If you if you look up lady boss weight loss
 You'll see Kaitlyn and I mentioned a couple of my inner circle members by name and many of us that they're full name
 But that's kind of who they are so you have some context as you listening to this
 But listen this boxer uses a personal coaching call for yourself and hope that it gets you excited and fired up
 To put in the effort you need to take over the world and to really change people's lives. So there you go
 Hey, what's going on everyone? This is Steve Larson and I work for Russell
 I am his assistant and he's asked me to go and clean up a lot of the audio for this podcast
 So as you listen to this episode
 Just know that Russell's answering the question really if I'm just one funnel away then how much farther away is that funnel?
 Yeah, so I don't know all the answers ever
 But for Mike my experience what like I don't think
 I don't think you
 Like I think you're seeing people's highlight rules and you're not seeing like the rest of it, right? Like
 And things can be shortcut they can speed up
 But like Anthony for example if you knew Anthony's whole story like it wasn't like he became this pilot
 I can do like Anthony is my coach of course for three years
 And he was barely scraping by for three years in the weight loss market going hard heavy targeting weight loss and women
 I mean weight loss is by far the most competitive market on planet
 So it's like to to be successful there you that to be super
 like a very unique angle or
 Have an amazing story if you have best sales people or best copywriters or whatever that is right to be dominating
 Anthony's tried weight loss for three and a half four years
 I knew him and struggled struggled struggled struggled struggling was like for him to have success
 We had a shift from weight loss into a completely different angle right blue or something about hacking thing and that's where he's finding some success
 But in that time
 I mean if you look at his his story like he can now lines today. She spent two years
 bio hacking himself
 On his death bed trying to figure out how to survive and if we figure out then you went on this mission where he literally like
 Like I love Anthony because his heart so big like I would say conservatively
 He probably coached at least a thousand people in three years most of them for free because they couldn't afford it
 He just loved people so much. He cared so much about him and that's how he found his voice
 That's how he is so much certain day when you talk Anthony. It's never like
 It's just absolute certainty so people plug into that right like absolutely certain
 He's like usually people follow me because in this thing that I'm good at absolutely certainly
 I have no no wavering doubt right like you're plugging me so like well Russell is certain
 So like I need to follow that and so but certainly doesn't come with by positioning a posh
 It's it's it's by putting in that work ahead of time right and just mastering it like and the point where you just know
 Right so like that's Anthony's journey
 Kaylin's is different Kaylin has such an amazing story like how much way she she gained she lost and she happens to become one of the best
 Selfs people ever
 Like I don't think there's any there's very few humans on earth to become a better selves person than Kean
 Which was it why they're dominating that market because she is so good at like it's so clear on her messaging and like
 Like she's one of the best I've ever seen
 And like she's dominating that right?
 You know and then Caleb's got just in Caleb not overnight sex store
 Success store either he's young but man that dude grinds more than anyone ever met like in same amounts hours and time and effort and
 And that time he was 13 years old. He read more books than I have right he had
 Done hundreds hundreds of Facebook lives during that time before him started hitting like that kids put in his 10,000 hours plus
 Before he's 15 years old so it's like like that that's that's what you're not seeing you're seeing like always a 13 year old kid
 Like he's successful. It's like well like he didn't just step into that and some people do some people are like
 Insanely talented doesn't make any sense right and it does that does happen but for most of us like it's not that way
 like
 Yeah, I didn't make a penny online for two plus years and then the next like five years were like
 hardly anything and that you know it took
 Seven or eight years before like I found my voice to be able to be in this market and have certainly where I felt that
 You know so how do you get that absolute certainty? It's by putting in the time is by doing the you know
 I mean so I actually am the coach for the two comical of a coaching program and I love it
 It's so much fun. It's fun to see because you know I've been doing this game now for about about four years now and for the first
 Several years I actually made no money with it at all
 I was with with any my funnels with with business entrepreneurship in general
 And I just I all I knew is I wanted to be an entrepreneur and I started putting my head down and working and I did everything from
 From stocks and options to real estate, you know commercial residential
 I went and did ebooks dordered or sales. I went and did telemarketing
 I went into I mean I did I did everything and it was all with this backdrop of just wanting to be an entrepreneur and
 Provide value in the marketplace and go do this stuff and and I failed my face off
 I mean it was one of the most humiliating things on you know in my entire life
 my wife and I were living on we were living on loans in college and
 Because I was I was you know my wife was basically the you know the the spouse of the suffering
 Entrepreneur and I didn't want to be that story and it turned into be this really painful experience
 But I I literally was listening to Russell's podcast. I was listening to these other entrepreneurs and their podcast and the other and I was
 it was honestly them like YouTube motivation videos and all stuff that just kept me going with it and
 And just the sheer belief
 It would work and also just you know mad obsession over the topic
 And if I could turn around and tell myself see me things now, it certainly be that I
 Really wish that I'd spent more time crafting my voice early on
 I like what Russell's mentioning inside of this this
 This podcast right here telling you know
 That you've got to figure out the voice and the way that I that I did early on was was by regularly publishing
 I just get out there and I just speak there was a time I after I read dot-com secret to win and I I was like
 Hey, I know enough to at least teach someone else and I literally held a three hour
 free class inside of a stranger's home and
 They had all these people there all these friends and family and I recorded the whole thing and that became my first info product
 And I didn't know that's what it would become I didn't know it was just pure obsession over
 The task pure obsession over the topic that that kept me going with it
 And so number one and one of the biggest things everyone struggles with when they start doing this thing is they
 They have to find their voice and if they can't find a voice that is where do they draw the line in the sand?
 Where's the polarity come from?
 Where's the passion?
 Where's the stories in the background?
 And if you've never spoken before you never put yourself out there before you never quite gonna know how that
 I was things actually fit together and so it's awkward for a lot of people who are just starting outside to comic up coaching
 Because they have never figured those things out. They don't know what that's like so not only are they trying to create a brand new product
 Right number one not only are they trying to create the sales message which have never done before either number three
 They're trying to find their voice. They're trying to do three things at the exact same time and you can do it
 But when people are going out and they're they're expecting hey
 I've been doing it for a month I've been doing for two months
 But they still have never actually been successful with it. It actually you know
 It's when you look at it from that angle tumors like well, of course, you're not successful right off the bat
 You're trying to figure out your voice your product and your message all at the exact same time
 And it's been two months and you have you're not happy with it
 You know and so you got to think of it from the other side
 These guys have been publishing for a super long time or people who've been you know
 Giants inside the marketplace you look behind every one of their success stories and every single one of them has got these amazing stories
 Usually they're rex to riches stories or usually their stories where there was so much failure at the beginning
 but they just kept their head down they just kept pushing forward on the whole thing and so
 those are the three things as you start moving forward and and
 You know you'll learn more about this in two-comical coaching that that really that that piece right there
 We'll put so many other things in place for you to keep going forward find your voice find your voice find your voice
 And I was really against finding my voice it sounds stupid, but I didn't want to listen to Russell
 I didn't want to listen to the things he was saying
 When I you know as before I worked for him or before anything else
 But I'd be listed to his podcast and he kept saying hey
 You gotta get out there and you gotta find your voice start publishing and I actively was like against that
 I was like there's no way I'm gonna podcast. There's no way I'm gonna start you tubing
 There's no I'm gonna do any of that crap. I don't want to do any of that and it was at his if it is at his event in 2016
 I don't money and I literally was building funnels and trading funnels for a ticket and trading funnels for a plane ticket and trading funnels for
 a hotel night stay I mean I had no money, but I just knew I needed to be there
 I've been hustling for as several years by that point and I got there and I sat down and I listened to Russell
 And I was like hey, I've worked my butt off to get here. I have no money
 I don't know how I'm gonna make it
 But what I'm gonna do is whatever he says I'm just gonna do it because I've put in the time and I
 You know, I just want to make this work and I know it will I just need to keep you know
 Just keep working it keep working it and so what I did is I went and I started
 I sat down I start taking notes and also Russell stands up and he goes I
 Every single one of you guys need to get out there and you got to start publishing it
 I was like crap you said it
 I gotta do it and I went out and I started publishing regularly and and the first 20 episodes that I did were really awkward
 They were bad and but I went something something happened something clicked my voice changed something happened my confidence changed
 I got stronger polarity what I believed
 Started coming out stronger as I went I started interviewing other people and started talking to others in the industry
 I figured out the place for me to exist in the ecosystem without being competitive with everybody else
 So it could be I would could collaborate and not compete as hard, you know in my own little blue ocean niche
 Amazing and what's cool is it when I started doing that and just like those in two comic Club
 I know a lot of you guys let's see this podcast as I'm just a little shout out to you guys
 But I know a lot of you guys what I say to you is hey
 If you go and you start just regularly publishing you'll number one find your voice
 But number two the place for your offer to exist the place where you need to create your new opportunity
 Your your new niche that place will start to bubble up and start to merge
 out of the
 Red ocean the red submarket ocean and it's amazing. What's gonna start to happen too?
 You'll start to figure out the message the market will start to tell you everything that you need to know you don't know
 Enough to actually be successful on your own you don't the market will tell you everything always
 Don't try to come up with it on your own if you do that fantastic way to fail fantastic way to lose money
 I did it for years. I can tell you all about it. Really what this game is is
 Go funnel hack, which does not mean pages. All right if the offer is online then yes
 That means pages but go funnel hack an individual funnel hack their voice
 Funnel hack their offer funnel hack their message
 Right and so what you do is you start to see this picture that emerges out of the sand. Oh my gosh
 That's what I have to go make here's here's the formula here
 It is that's your best shot you take your best shot at launching that thing and then he step back and wait
 And what ends up happening is all these people will start to give you feedback. I wish ahead this right
 They'll come on the form of complaints. I wish ahead this your product sucks at this
 Don't push that stuff away
 Those are the things that that let you know that you were doing well
 Those are the things that let you know what to create and build next right so you take the aggregate voice the aggregate
 Complaint about your product the aggregate feedback and those are the things the market is tell that's the market telling you what to go make
 Then you go make that thing and what's nice is when you do that and you take those pieces of feedback
 You number one take your best shot number two get feedback number three you turn on and tweak it and relaunch it
 Now you're in this little cool little iteration cycle, but the pressure is not on you anymore. You've already launched the thing
 It's already up. It's already rocking and you're getting feedback
 But anyway, so that's what I'd say that's just my commentary on this piece right now that
 I completely stand by and behind everything and he's saying with this that that it is so in order to gain confidence
 You got to live it and you got to live in it every day
 You got to be the expert the go-to person inside of the industry itself and so
 And it's harder when you don't have like a story since like
 like
 Because I give them the one that I watch I know a lot about we lost market
 I've struggled with weight my throughout my life
 I've coached a lot of people on market so I was watching and just not to critique certain things, but just like
 The one thing I know from weight loss market
 People I've worked through it is that people in weight loss are very skeptical
 I guess if somebody is
 It doesn't have a story there of a weight like they don't understand what it's like to be me
 Like that's that belief and then like in the video you guys talked about like how to target certain areas how to reduce fat
 And I was like cool. This is like a good topic
 It's something people very concerned about people have left hand as they have this that maybe do want to target spots
 And then the advice is kind of like don't target spot like lose all your weight and I felt like
 Like that that message was not like that most most overweight people that I know would have
 Would have that message
 Was not not only not shareable. It was like the opposite like it would push them away like we have no idea
 You've never you never had left handles like they got what that's what how they would have how they would react
 Right, I know that support so many overweight people and I've done that like and you guys know that you should know that you told
 Somebody that say oh don't worry about like here your love handles
 You got to lose this like because you told from that face to face
 You know that you should know that like this is your market like you shown that that would have repelled those people because the number one concern that every
 Single person the weight loss market has when they show working with a trainer is this person has no idea how I feel because
 They're not overweight. That's why Caitlin's story so central her success is because that's what they all that's the biggest belief, right?
 That's that is the biggest limiting belief in that market people have
 The my market is different my market is like if this stuff works so good
 Why don't you give to me for free like that's my market something beliefs like that's I'm fighting it's all the time right?
 And so like you got no that in your market and then like
 Thinking that comes from like doing this over and over and over again
 And then they're doing it and then people send it and then doing again next time they don't get as a fan
 It's kind of like this is the groundhog day right like every time Bill Murray comes back and he relives the life
 He like doesn't wrong say tweaks it comes back does again doesn't wrong please it
 You know eventually like has a good life
 But it's like you know how many years he was in that that groundhog day experience and it's like we need that in volume a lot
 But I also think I did like defining your message better because like it's like where the money be made right now
 It's not in like traditional weight loss. It's in the fads or blue oceans
 Whatever right keto bias like that's a hot thing
 So it's like when we launched to prove it we were kind of first people coming out there
 And now there's been this huge swell of thousands of different keto brands and products and things like that
 So we're receiving some of our failing, but it's the ones that are like
 diving into this market. It's hot
 As you get again extra secrets 101 like find a hot market ask them to give it to you
 But they want what they need right you find out exactly what they want you sell them that and then you can fulfill and give them what they need
 But that's that's the big thing. I understand the market super well only way to ask about like putting in the time of the effort so
 And so like that's just completely being clean honest
 So you got to differentiate completely and have like this sub market that you're like right now
 Dave Woodward works for his wife's going into that market and she tried for four or five years
 He's even weight loss market and she's got amazing stories like
 She's been in personal training forever like and she's struggled because it's like she's stepping up to play with the best
 The best of the best and so finally she's made the shift to her whole program is now called have it on moms
 It's focusing on moms. It's how weight loss within moms
 There's not just weight loss
 But also this other parts and personal development and like she's carved out this ocean now
 She's finally getting traction
 There's four or five years like he's going up the big leagues and she's she's a great sales person
 She's always saying that she's struggled and so again for she guys
 It's like you got to find your your market. You got to find the market where like what people actually want what they're looking for
 Not so much what they need we fulfill what they need, but we've got some what they want, right?
 So that's that's that there's art in the science of this game, right?
 I think you've heard hopefully for me talk about that and I think
 Like most people that that struggle as entrepreneurs typically are like a student
 I'm guessing you're an a student like just by default like because they're really really good at the science
 right the big that part of it, but the art is something that you feel and
 and it's it's different and so
 That's typically people with really good students struggle with that because it's like it doesn't comes naturally
 Or usually like the C students or ones really get the art of it, but they struggle with the science, right?
 and so
 For most businesses I recommend for people it's like if you're if you're in that spot
 It's like you figure out who you are like when I got started this business one of my first mentors told me said look there's
 So that in every business there needs to be a starter and a finisher
 You got to figure out who you are and then fun like surround yourself with the other people and at that time
 My business I was like well, I'm a starter really good starting really bad finishing and so I was like hey
 I need to show myself with with finishers so I started hiring people at really good finishers
 That's why people are asking me so much stuff done
 It's because I have the ability to start a thousand things, but I've got team behind me and finishes them all
 But I know my strengths are no my weaknesses are if you're Tony Robbins business mastery
 He talks about every company has three types of personality types
 She got to have
 You know the an artist an entrepreneur and a manager and so the artist is the person's obsessed with that thing one
 Who's got to be obsessed like that's the artist right next person is the entrepreneur
 There's a person's out there like risking and like going crazy and like and like
 Doing like that probably being going out there doing stuff and there's managers who's just in the management roles, right?
 And so just looking at that like inherently what do you best at you best at managing and best you obsessed with the art of this thing
 Or you the entrepreneur who's going out there and wants to sell the crap out of it
 I think a phone hacking live one of the presentation they talked about
 They connected that constantly call that they need a hustler hacker and the designer
 And like a quick click phone was like I was hustler taught was a hacker and Dylan was designed right that that was the three pieces
 And so and all you can't learn the other stuff
 You can like but like that's not how businesses grow by us figuring out weaknesses and focusing on right in
 Business is the opposite. It's like
 Find your strengths and quadruple down on it and abandon your weaknesses and plug in other people in the spots
 So it's backwards so it's like yes, you're capable of learning those things
 But don't because because it's so much better to find those people and plug them in right and so
 I even brand new to Caitlin you look at them. There's another successful
 is you have
 Caitlin who is like the artist right she's obsessed with her art like and she's also
 Like one of the best sales people out right so be you have that but her by herself would fail and she has her husband
 Who is like the manager entrepreneur like like risking like that kind of thing because they have both halves is why they've blown up
 Okay, for me. I don't have a spouse because I don't have so I brought team members and partners and that that that's why we never blow up
 It's like okay, let's take my strengths. I know what these are like like I'm really good at this piece
 I was find somebody who doubts their strengths and this team up and now it's like boom now you can't wait more impact with people right?
 Whatever that is really understanding the market but being obsessed with that like whoever it is
 That's the artist in your in your business needs to be obsessed with that needs to be reading 40 blog posts a day listening
 Like I listened today. So I'm a marketing guy
 I don't think there's probably few people in earth that know more about marketing right now than they not to be cocky
 But like I'm kind of obsessed with it right today. I think I've listened to eight and I marketing podcasts
 I bought three products
 I recorded 23 videos today
 If you don't actually 29 videos today recorded on the topic I got done at six came home
 He did my kid. They're not going back in cuz like I'm so excited seeing I gotta keep going back
 It's I was today for me and so it's because I'm obsessed with the art of it, right?
 It's like there's got to be someone there that's that obsessed with it. Well, it's gonna be really hard to drive it
 You know I got a message back the first message. It was like oh, hey
 So I just in Facebook lives nobody showed up. I just crickets like that's been bugged you if you're an artist
 You should not care
 You love to hear your voice and you just want to talk and share and step and learn and give and share and talk like
 Whether people are listening or not it should not matter like you should be like whoever the artist is in the business
 That's the kind of level obsession and you have to be able to succeed
 So it's like understanding that and then like if that's not me that's cool find some of that
 That's how obsessed they are and then plug in your stuff where you're obsessed like you plug those two things together
 And now you got like a force of nature to be reckoned with right, but it's got it, but there's got to be
 Like that's the pieces that there's any business
 It's like you have to get it into orbit and you can't do that by being a normal human and just like waking up and doing your thing
 Right like it takes Rob session like that's why it takes an entrepreneur to launch a business get into the stratosphere
 I'm noticing that the at stratosphere higher bunch of MBAs and people to plug it in and just kind of keep the thing moving
 But it's obsession that gets it into orbit right a rocket can't get into orbit unless it's got a huge booster
 So just blow the crap out of it push it off the ground
 but again it's tripling quadrupling down on your strengths and
 Backing off their weaknesses and find people who your weaknesses your strengths. That's the build company and blow it up fast
