 Hey everyone, it's Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the Marketing Secrets Podcast.
 I hope you guys enjoyed the first of the three episodes of the conversation domination presentation.
 Today I'm going to release the second part of this presentation, which will be diving deeper and deeper into it.
 I hope you guys are enjoying this concept and you started thinking in your minds, okay, how do I dominate this conversation?
 So when my potential customers are on any platform, all they see is me, telling my stories, you're making my offers, all that kind of stuff.
 And so I'm going to queue up the second part of this presentation right after we get back from the theme song.
 So the big question is this. How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain profitable?
 That is the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers.
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing Secrets.
 So right now the first step in this process is shifting your mindset from buying ads to sell products to buying ads to build your distribution channels.
 That makes sense? Okay, so all these things are all pushing back and I want to build distribution.
 If I'm building an email distribution, message or distribution and the last thing at the very end there says MD.
 That's the cool stuff we're going to show you tomorrow night. That's the new update inside of action edicts called action edicts multidimensional.
 So MD, that's what we're talking about here. It's coming up soon.
 All right, so all the ads goal are to build distributions.
 Now what's the goal of my distribution? Okay, the goal of distribution, having this distribution channel is to sell stuff.
 That's it.
 So me as you're all trying to be romantic about it, like, oh no, it's like build a relationship.
 Yeah, that's all nice, but I want you to understand the reason why people built TVs and they hired the cast of Happy Days to learn roles and get scripts and build entire show was for one reason, one reason only.
 So they can sell stuff during the commercials.
 Okay, this is the sham while guy actually met him one time.
 So funny.
 I don't think he was advertising every Happy Days, but that's the key.
 Okay, so what we're doing is we're getting all the distribution so we can build these lists.
 We can sell them products and services like that's that's the secret.
 Okay, so that's the key.
 Now what is the typical there's a couple problems with like traditional online distribution.
 Okay, so email and messengers.
 First thing like email.
 There's kind of a feeling like if you email someone more than once a day, how many of you guys get annoyed about like, what is this person email like five or six times a day.
 Okay, there's kind of like these unset rules of like just like once a day is like max and some of you guys are probably less than like once a day.
 Or twice a week or three times a week.
 Like there's just kind of like these weird rules.
 Where it's like that's kind of as much as you can possibly do.
 If you get more than once a day, it just gets kind of weird.
 Messengers even more intimate.
 I remember I'm a huge Tim Ferris fan and he launched his messenger bot and I opted in in the first like 48 hours.
 They got like 14 messages and I like I don't unsubscribe from almost anything because I'm a marketing.
 I love stuff and I remember being so annoying.
 Like he keeps sending these like messenger so intimate.
 And so I feel like for me person about once to maybe twice a week is the most I can message with them with a messenger before you cause like weirdness and disconnect.
 Okay, so that's a limit that we have here.
 Okay, if you've got things like text messaging, it's even less.
 You text mention them once a day, you're going to jail.
 Like it's it's crazy, right?
 And so they have these limits.
 So the good limits, but there's definitely limits.
 When I understand like I have this distribution channel like what should I do with it?
 How can I increase how I can connect with people?
 Okay, so what I do is my distribution, my email, my messenger, the goal outside of selling stuff, which is my number one goal.
 My second goal now is to build the shows on my channel.
 Okay, I'll show you that in here in a second and that way we can sell more stuff and more people.
 Okay, so I'm using this distribution now to build my channels to build my Instagram following to build my Facebook following to build my YouTube following to build my podcast.
 Okay, so I'm using my once a day, maybe twice a week, whatever those things are outside of selling products and services they have.
 I'm using it to build these channels because I build a channel of a thousand, five thousand, hundred thousand people.
 Then I can on that channel, I can do a whole bunch of stuff more often.
 Okay, so we're going to be building our individual shows on the platform.
 Okay, on our phone.
 This is coming back to what Gary V talked about earlier.
 There's Facebook app, there's Instagram, all these apps are here on people's phones.
 We're building our personal show on each of these.
 Some of you guys are probably wondering like, "Well, Russell, why do I need a show? I'm selling soap or I'm selling this or I'm selling whatever it is you're selling, right?"
 And this is why, how many of you guys remember Arsenio Hall?
 That's it? How many of you guys remember Arsenio Hall?
 Okay, so Arsenio Hall was a talk show, big famous dude back in the whenever, when I was a little kid.
 How many of you guys saw him on a celebrity apprentice two or three years ago before Trump ran for president and the whole thing disappeared?
 You guys remember this?
 Okay, so there's a really poor, less here.
 So Arsenio Hall is on celebrity friendness.
 He's trying to win this huge thing and all sorts of stuff, right?
 And they're doing a fundraising activity.
 Okay, and so everyone's out there to call them all their famous friends and try to raise money for some charity.
 And all the people out there are calling these people and making a bunch of money.
 And Arsenio Hall is sitting there and he calls every single person he's calling, nobody answers his thing.
 And nobody's picking him.
 And when the entire thing was over, he raised zero dollars for the charity by calling his network of contacts.
 And he's thinking they're on this couch just one time and he says this thing that was just like so powerful to me.
 He said, "When I had my own show, everybody returned my calls.
 You lost his platform.
 You lost his show."
 Okay, when you build a platform, I guess you guys, everybody will turn your call.
 There's gonna be a reason why I can get into networks and people that most people can't is because I have a platform.
 You understand that?
 When Tony Robbins is launching his book last year, he has to be interviewing us.
 He's talking about all sorts of stuff because I have a platform.
 Okay, and in the markets you're in, if you have a platform, all sorts of doors will open for you, just like Arsenio Hall.
 You don't have a platform that's gonna be harder and harder and harder.
 So that's why there's value in building up these channels because it opens up insane amounts of doors.
 Plus your followers are there.
 All right, so if you look at the different platforms, they all work on different premises.
 One of the biggest mistakes people make a lot of times is that they think all the channels are the same.
 They make one message and they spam it out to all the things.
 It's like, ah, every, there's things you have to understand about each platform.
 If you understand the differences and how to actually publish on them, then it becomes really, really fun.
 Okay, so I look at Instagram as my reality show.
 Okay, so if you think about reality shows, think about the Bachelor, think about the friend is, think about survivor, think about American.
 All these different reality shows, right?
 It's reality is like how you're interacting with somebody is like that.
 Okay, so I'll go deeper than here in a second.
 But Instagram is my reality show.
 Facebook now is my talk show.
 So think, um, you think tonight's show, think Ellen, think the view, like it's a talk show.
 That's what how that platform is used.
 Number three platform I talk about is YouTube, which I position YouTube more like a sitcoms, like Seinfeld or Friends.
 And number four platform I talk about is Podcast, which like a radio show, right?
 Like Howard Stern, Glenn Beck.
 And then there's other channels that are coming.
 Okay, Gary V talked about other channels are coming and we need to be aware of those.
 Because if a channel comes, you can jump in it quick before it gets too big.
 And you can set a plot, uh, you can build out your channel quickly.
 Biggings are happening.
 So I'm always looking for the new channels.
 The one that I've been looking at recently is Twitch.
 Have you guys ever seen Twitch before?
 This is the ESPN of our little phones, except for instead of like people sitting there and watching soccer or football or wrestling or whatever sport, they watch each other play video games.
 It's insane, right?
 If you go to Twitch and watch those channels, like 100,000 people watch if someone plays a video game.
 Like it is like the sports center of our phones.
 It's crazy.
 Okay, so in your business, could you start a game of business or a game of whatever you do and make it into a thing?
 Maybe.
 We're probably going to be launching a Twitch channel where we all just build funnels all day long.
 We let everyone, anyway, who knows, this can be fun.
 But I'm looking for channels coming.
 Okay, so this is one, but as the phone keeps growing more things going to be happening right now, still there's very few that, again, all of the eyeballs.
 If you look at like the social networks, the ones that the majority of eyeballs are the four we talked about earlier.
 Okay, so Instagram is your reality show, Facebook's your talk show, YouTube's your sitcom, podcast your radio show, and there's other ones, your blog, Pinterest, like, there's a whole bunch of other ones as well.
 And every business is going to be different.
 Some of you guys, it's like Pinterest might be really big for your business.
 Other people that might be the worst thing in the world.
 Some of you guys like to tweet and that makes a lot of sense.
 So it's kind of like it's felt what platform works for your business.
 Okay.
 All right, so the question is, is why do we build multiple shows?
 And I want you guys to understand this.
 I had this big epiphany a little while ago.
 How many guys like to read blog posts?
 Okay.
 The weird thing about people like to read blog posts, this is deep.
 They like to read blog posts.
 Is that weird?
 How many guys like to watch YouTube videos?
 Okay, people like to watch YouTube videos, it's really weird.
 They like to watch YouTube videos.
 How many guys are listening to podcasts?
 People listen to podcasts.
 They like listening to podcasts.
 It's really weird.
 So I was thinking about this like Stephen Larson here.
 Yeah, that's what I was hoping for.
 So I love Stephen.
 These are my favorite human beings on earth.
 And what's funny about Stephen is like, I know that Stephen's not on Instagram.
 So if I post anything on Instagram, he's like, I have no one you're talking about.
 But if I mention on my podcast, he's like, dude, I heard your podcast.
 But he listens to podcasts.
 He's not on Instagram.
 There are people who are only on YouTube and they're not on Facebook.
 People have the platforms that they love that they love to be at.
 And so if I'm only on Facebook, a lot of people don't like Facebook.
 I'm missing out on huge audiences who are listening to podcasts.
 Listening to different places, okay?
 So I like to be everywhere because there's crossover, but people have their favorite platforms.
 Okay, not everyone likes all the channels.
 But I guarantee everyone likes one channel.
 That's where they go to their news, their entertainment is there.
 So I like to be in all the places so I can get to all the different people and all the different channels.
 Okay?
 So my question for you guys is all these channels right here, which one you guys think is the most important to grow for your own conversation nomination?
 Oh, no, you're wrong.
 Any ideas?
 Which one do you think is the most important?
 Yeah, these are all over the place.
 All right.
 So I'm going to make an argument because this is probably a little controversial, but I think I'm right.
 So I think the most important channel to build first is actually Instagram.
 What?
 Like three people are freaking out.
 It's like, no.
 And this is why.
 You see, this is my framework for this presentation.
 The cool thing about Instagram is that on email, I can send like one email a week or day.
 Basically, I should one or two a week, maybe on Instagram, I can literally, with my own reality show, carry this phone around with me and I can do 20, 30, 40, 50 little mini episodes a day.
 Nobody cares.
 They look forward to it.
 It's crazy.
 Okay?
 So I promote Instagram because Instagram gives me ability to promote all the different things that I'm doing all the time and actually promote the episode.
 So a couple of things.
 Number one, Instagram is your own personal reality show.
 I promise you, when you first start doing this, the people who you love around you will think you're insane.
 It will drive them crazy.
 You'll be like, hey, look at that.
 And you're like, always on video.
 Okay?
 It's really weird for my wife at first, I think.
 She used to now though, right?
 It's tough because you're documenting this whole process, right?
 How many of you haven't watched my Instagram stories behind the scenes over the last three days?
 If not, you miss like I'm showing you guys everything, the secrets behind the, it's all in there.
 I'm documenting my, it's like a reality.
 I'm documenting every single day, all the cool stuff I'm doing.
 And because of that, I get all those people who are watching those things every single day.
 Okay?
 Number one, number two is that intimacy is like, is one of the best platforms I've ever seen to build a, to build a relationship with the attractive character.
 Okay?
 This comes back to what Natalie was talking about with, with vulnerability.
 Like when I'm on a Facebook Live, I'm usually, I'm kind of postured because I'm like doing my show or whatever.
 But I'm on Instagram, like, I'm at home with my kids.
 I'm at the pool.
 I'm doing like, it's this different level of intimacy where people get to know you at a different level.
 I promise you, those who watch my Instagram stories, I bet you most of you guys feel like you know me a lot better than those who don't.
 Because different level of intimacy happens there.
 Okay?
 It also gives you ability to document the journey.
 Like, I'm documenting this entire journey of, of this event, right?
 And I guarantee you all of the 10,000 plus people a day who are watching my shows who aren't here, they're going to get tickets before this event's over.
 They don't know yet.
 But they're going to.
 Okay?
 I'm giving you some severe FOMO.
 I learned this from Julius.
 FOMO stands for fear of missing out.
 So I'm doing this talking about this journey and they're like freaking out because they're right here and they're missing all the pieces and they're going to see Tony Robbins backstage and be like, "Ah, like I'm missing out on this stuff, right?"
 So I'm documenting the whole journey along this process.
 Okay, now again, cool things while I like channel.
 You can publish people 20 to 30 times a day and they don't care.
 Okay, the way it works, I make a little video and at the end of it I say swipe up and if they swipe up on the screen, it takes them to any website that I want.
 Okay?
 Before you have 10,000 followers, you can't do that.
 You have to go to the link of my bio and you can go see the special thing, right?
 But as soon as you get about 10,000 customers, then you can start doing swipe ups which are like the coolest thing in the world.
 And I'll talk about swipe ups or how to get 10,000 people here in a minute.
 But that's kind of the goal.
 Okay?
 So what's cool about this, I'm going to show you the next slide.
 Yeah, what's cool about this is that I'm doing these stories and I'm documenting my journey and taking people throughout my life.
 A bunch of really cool things happen.
 Because I knew all sorts of product placement.
 It's not really like I'm selling stuff but people buy things like crazy.
 For example, my wife bought these really cool feet things.
 I can't remember what they're called.
 We put our feet in them and you put some salt in, you put a thing and within like 15 minutes, all this like black green stuff starts oozing out of your feet.
 And so we do with our kids, it's really, really fun.
 And we're like, look at our feet, this is disgusting.
 I've gotten, I can't tell you how many people mess with me wherever I that.
 I need one.
 What's the link like?
 I need that, right?
 They want stuff because they're seeing you interact every single day.
 You guys remember American Idol back in the, you watched American Idol and every single, every single host has like a big old coke on their desk?
 Like coke's paying for them to have that coke there, right?
 That's not a real thing.
 It's product placement.
 So you're like, we're filming in my office and I'm like, oh, hey guys, we're in the bathroom.
 Here's the two comic club awards.
 Man, like, look at me and I'm talking about these things and people are like, oh, I'm going to be in the two comic club.
 Oh, we got the new t-shirts today.
 All these are crazy.
 It's like, I need a t-shirt.
 Like you're sharing all these things you're doing anyway and people start seeing it in the product placement.
 Number two is you can pre-sell your content.
 Okay, the goal of my Instagram reality show outside of like having all these cool things on building connection is to push people to all the other different things that I'm doing.
 Okay, so I might be like, hey guys, I'm working on a blog post and I'm talking about this.
 It's going to be amazing.
 And then like an hour later, hey, the blog post is almost done.
 I'm in a puglish.
 It's going to be awesome.
 How many of you guys want to see it?
 And the next thing would be like, okay, it's going live right now.
 I'm pushing it.
 Here it goes.
 Oh, let's push it.
 And also they've watched these three or four stories and they're like, I need to read that post.
 This looks amazing.
 So you can expose swipe up to check out the post and also they're like, boom, they're going and they're checking on the post because they're part of this thing with you, the creation of the content.
 So I'm creating a YouTube video.
 I'm creating a podcast.
 I'm creating whatever I'm talking about it.
 And then when I get it, I'm like, it's live now guys.
 Check it out.
 Swipe up insane amounts of people start going and start looking instantly.
 Okay, so I'm pretty, it's pretty solid content.
 I push people to my content.
 I can also offer some products through it and a whole bunch of other things.
 Okay, so I love this.
 Now this is the big benefit of Instagram.
 Okay, when I'm using email and Messenger, I'm using, I'm focusing on that to build my channels.
 But the problem is that inside of your channels, you have all sorts of episodes, right?
 If you're like me, you're putting out a whole bunch of content.
 You're blogging, you're YouTube, your Facebook, like all these things are happening.
 And if I went and I emailed my email list every time I had a new piece of content going live, they'd be in like 30 emails a day and they would hate me and they'd unsubscribe, be angry, right?
 So I use my email and my Messenger to build these channels up.
 And then when something goes live, my podcast, those who are already on my channel will hear it.
 And those who aren't, if they're following my Instagram, I'm going to push them back into these individual episodes.
 That makes sense?
 Instagram gives me the push to all the different episodes, all the content, all the things I'm pushing out there.
 That's why I love Instagram so much.
 Okay, if you guys want to see this happening, this is my Instagram thing.
 If you're not following me yet, just go to Russell Brunson and see it.
 And you'll see behind the scenes what we're doing.
 We're talking, we're sharing, I'm taking this journey in my life.
 And then when I have new content, I'm like, oh, check this out.
 Check this out.
 Check this out.
 Okay, this is powerful because imagine a lot of people post YouTube video.
 How am I going to get this a little bit?
 That's not exciting.
 I'm jumping ahead.
 You post YouTube video or a podcast, all the algorithms based on how much viewership you get, how fast.
 So if I'm talking about my thing, talking about it, I post the video and tell my entire Instagram,
 I swipe up right now and I get 3,000 people to swipe up and actually go and watch the video.
 I get 3,000 views and then the first five or six minutes of this thing spikes everything else and amplifies everything else you're doing on every single channel.
 Does that make sense?
 Okay, so it's really fun.
 So if those are new videos on Instagram before, this is the little block right here.
 You click on Instagram, then you click over there, top, the very top across the top are my little reality show.
 So this is my reality show.
 Who else is on that?
 I think Natalie's up there.
 There's Natalie's reality show.
 Kayla's reality show, Alex Sharfins reality show, Rachel Peterson.
 There's, holy cow, four of our speakers' reality shows are all the top across their mind.
 So you click on the one you want to watch and then you pop up and you're like, oh, there's Russell and Nora.
 What are they doing today?
 She's so cute.
 Oh, she's where I go to school today.
 She's angry.
 She's like, oh, I'm a new blog post.
 I should check it out.
 Boom, I got you.
 Right?
 Connection.
 Now you actually care.
 Most of the time you write a blog post and you email your list or whatever, nobody cares.
 Here they care because they're part of that journey of like, I'm writing this thing.
 I'm doing research.
 This is why I'm talking about like, oh, you guys are going to love it.
 Check out the picture.
 I just posted right here.
 Oh, I can't have this thing to go live.
 And then it goes live and they're part of it with you.
 Okay.
 If they've been part of the creation process, they're going to be more engaged as you actually do it.
 They're actually going to care.
 And that's what Instagram stories give you.
 Okay.
 I'm not too much time to go into this, but there's an amazing article by Kevin Kelly.
 I talked about this last year's event too called the Thousand True Fans.
 And his arguments basically, if you have a thousand true fans that are following you, that's
 enough for any type of creator to have an entire business to run their whole life off
 it, right?
 Who are my true fans?
 Like my true fans are people who are following me throughout the day watching me.
 Like my definition of true fans, someone who's on Instagram, who every single time I publish
 something, they're there.
 Okay.
 So you click on the button to see all the people and I'm like, oh, I know exactly like exactly
 what those people are.
 They're your true fans.
 Okay.
 So I love Instagram and that's kind of the key.
 All right.
 So to show you guys how this all works.
 So I wake up in the morning, I'm like, hey, I'm in bed.
 You guys, what's going on?
 And I'm like, oh, here I'm with Nora.
 She's so awesome.
 And then Nora say hi to everybody.
 Oh, and then I'm like, hey, you guys for a lucky life six days away swipe up right now.
 If you haven't got your ticket yet, it's going to be awesome.
 Like swipe up and scope for it.
 And I'm like, oh my gosh, you guys, I'm in the bathroom right now.
 I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
 And I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
 And I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
