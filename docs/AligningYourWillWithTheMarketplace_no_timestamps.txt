 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing seekers podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 Hey everyone hope you guys are all having an amazing day today
 Whoa juggle my phone as I get in the car so
 Whoo crazy day so
 We're just leaving
 I got to leave the house stand and walked out and Nora was outside on
 The trampolines jumping so these are my crazy stories
 We're a big side yard that was just kind of a big empty weed field, so we decided this year to go a little crazy
 so we put in a
 football slash soccer field volleyball court
 basketball court baseball
 Attract the wraps the whole thing and then nine underground trampolines and they got nine underground trampolines up this weekend
 Well, we were gone so we spent all the way last night. We got home jumping and then this morning
 It's actually even I could hear little giggles outside and when it's side and we're was jumping so it's a little bit cold out here
 But when jumped for the last little bit now, I'm heading out buckling up my car
 And we're ready to rock and roll so um
 It's funny we were gone this week went and drove to
 Burly where my in-laws live when we drop off our kids
 I mean from there we drove down to Salt Lake because I had a meeting that'll tell you about here in a second
 But it's funny cuz on the way home we were camping stuff at that. So I haven't shaved in two days
 So my face was all like prickly you know what I mean and I speak of Nora yesterday and like her curly hair is like velcro on my
 on my beard and
 I just like I tried for two days and I hate it so I just shaved this morning
 I was like oh I feel so much better, but I hate it cuz like I've been watching we've been studying dollar shave club
 dollar beard clubs
 Offboarding process that I wrote about in funnel university this this month and like I don't know what it is
 like all the beard guys just seen cooler like and I just like part of me's like I wanna be cool like the beard guys
 But I just can't two days and I gave up and it was horrible
 And so I'll never be as cool as a beard guys, but I will give them credit
 They are definitely cooler than a shave guys. So anyway, hopefully someday
 I'll become a man and be able to grow one out, but that day is not today. So anyway, so I want to share some today
 And to me as I've been taking Russell this is a marketing podcast
 Why are you talking about God and it's like because he has to do everything
 It's really important and bless my learn this weekend
 Has to do with God, but it also then relates back to you guys in your market
 And so I think it's really really important. So I was in Utah and I was meeting
 I had a meeting with
 Someone who is one of the top leaders in in my church in them in the Mormon church and
 We believe in our church that there's a prophet in this world of apostles similar to how when Christ was on earth and my meeting
 Was one of the possible, which was really a huge honor and scary and exciting and all those things all wrapped into one
 And I had a chance to meet with him and so this whole week prior leading up to it
 You know, I've had a lot of thoughts about just life and how things work and then obviously meeting with him and afterwards
 and just it was really neat reflection time and
 There's something that came out. I mean there's a lot of stuff
 I wish I could share in the context of this podcast, but it's probably not appropriate or the right spot
 And so I won't but there was one thing that kept ringing through my head
 That I wanted to share because I think it's an important and it does relate back to marketing
 So there you go. Is that right if I remember it back to market and talk about God for a few minutes?
 Hopefully that's okay
 So it's interesting is if you look at the world what the world tries to do
 Is they is that they?
 They see kind of like and I don't want to get political because I don't care about politics at all
 So I'm not gonna get political, but I see this most like it's amplified in politics, right? Where it's like
 These are the agenda items who are you really believe this?
 They believe this and they fight back and forth and who's right who's wrong all sorts of stuff like that, right?
 And it's kind of crazy and it's been interesting as I've you know my wife and I'm not perfect this by any stretch like it's very spire to be
 But when I look at an issue right look at something it shouldn't be like what do I believe like what is Russell believe on this topic?
 It should be
 Okay, I believe in a God
 So what does God actually believe on this topic and then my job as a human here is not to try to like convince God
 But like no no no no no you're wrong right because he's not so my goal is to look at like what he believes on the topic and
 Bend my will towards that and so okay. This is what he believes therefore
 This is what I believe and that's that's how it should be if you do believe in an all-powerful all-powerful creator who created
 The heavens and earth and everything I think that we should like bend our will towards him back
 Okay, this is what he thinks therefore this is what I think on any topic so it's like
 You know like I think that's it's important
 So we're trying to set up our beliefs and we you know what we're for and for Gantz
 Those kind of things like it should be less of like listen my penis
 I think is right so I studied where I read and she'd be like
 What does God actually think and then sit back and pray and find out he believes and then be cool?
 I will make I will align my will with years
 I'll align with that because that's what you believe and so I was thinking about that and again again
 I something I probably would normally share inside the podcast
 But I started thinking about this from the business standpoint too because there's always correlations between
 All things right, and it's funny because a lot of the entrepreneurs that I work with
 It's interesting like what they?
 What they do is they have an idea right?
 This is this product I want to create it's the crazy in the world it's gonna change the mankind and I want to charge this price for it
 This I want to deliver it all they have all these things that they want to do because it's their idea
 Right it's their baby and they go out there and they put out the market and the market crushes it
 It's like that idea sucks or that price points not right or whatever it is right in the market goes and and does its thing
 In the market in this situation is kind of like God like like the market doesn't care who you are
 Not that God and God does care, but the market doesn't care who you are right the market doesn't care good your ideas
 Right what the market is what it is like you put your thing out there and it will tell you like that idea sucked or that
 It was amazing or whatever like the thing in between there is right?
 And so for our jobs entrepreneurs is not to try like convince the market that our ideas the best
 Our ideas to find like what does the market actually want and then align our will with that?
 And when you do that that's when things explode right?
 That's like when we test funnels like we'll test and like oh the market said no
 We try it again and we twist test to tweak the messaging and the pricing we keep moving things around to we figure like
 What does the market actually want like what do they like how much they want to spend for this?
 What's the price like what do they actually want they even want this product?
 What am I it is they didn't want like is grave and ideas
 I thought they were the market did not care about it and the market is is the only thing that actually matters
 And so like I always tell people like tries me crazy people in in
 My coaching programs and Facebook groups and everything they'll come in and I'll be like hey, what's the?
 Like what's your opinion on this?
 I'm like do you don't take my opinion on it like I don't even trust my own opinion on my own stuff
 I let the market decide I create the thing the best I know how to do based on what I've seen the market response in the past
 I've make that thing and then I send some traffic to it and I let the market vote
 And I don't let the market vote through quizzes or surveys or things like that
 We're like oh yeah
 I would buy that the only thing that I care about is people to actually pull their wallet out of their pocket and swipe a credit card
 That is how the market votes. They don't vote with their mouth
 They vote with their credit card and yes, I do it for those watching the video
 I do have a cliff funnel sticker on my wallet because that is what fills my wallet full of
 the stuff that we need to buy so
 anyway, so that's that's
 That's that's how it works. So for for you guys and entrepreneurs
 It's important for you not to get so caught up on your ideas and what you believe
 It is important to figure out what the market actually wants what they actually believe
 They believe this is worth this amount of money
 They believe that this is what they want to buy like you figure out what the market actually wants and you do that you become rich
 Right if you fight against that you struggle and I've seen people go years sometimes decades and never have success because
 They they are trying to jam their beliefs down the markets throat and the market doesn't care about you
 All the market wants is what it wants and so you have to figure out what it wants
 And then you align your will with that
 And that's it
 And so as I was thinking about this weekend with the with God and with you know our
 Our responsibility not so much to try to dictate what we believe and try to shove it down his throat
 But to figure out what he believes and then and then align our wills with him
 It's the same thing with the market and when you understand that that's when business becomes a lot easier
 Okay, it comes back to expert secrets one-on-one like page three or whatever like find a hot market ask me
 They want and then give it to him. Okay does not say find a hot market decide what you think would be awesome to create
 And then jam it down their throats like that is a hard business to run
 Okay, it's the opposite way find a hot market ask them what they want and then give it to them
 That's it in the market will tell you so
 Mark you'll tell you if you're right mark what type you're wrong and if you're wrong don't be mad about it
 Just change your approach change the price and change the hook change the angle change the product change the service
 Create what it wants and then everything else will take place that you need it to so there you go
 Is that okay if I we were religion into the thing?
 Because you guys don't believe in God it doesn't mean he's not there
 Like that's what's interesting like sometimes people friends like I don't believe in God you should talk about like whether you believe in him or not
 He's still there like that's the interesting thing. I feel it. I don't believe that this will sell like whether you believe it or not
 It doesn't really matters with the market believes so let's go find out what the truth is and some liner beliefs with that
 That's in all aspects of life. So there you go
 That's a creature Brunson preaching on hope you guys remind it anyway
 But regardless hope you got something out of that one and hope you guys understand that that's how the world works
 How the market works and we understand that and you line your will towards it. That's how your girl company find a hot market ask
 What do you want to give it to me? All right guys, I'm at the office. I gotta go. See you guys all soon. Bye everybody
