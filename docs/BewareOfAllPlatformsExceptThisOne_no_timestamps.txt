 Hey everyone, it's Russell Brunson. Welcome to the Mark D. Seeker's podcast. Today we are taking this whole thing is happening on a private plane with
 Todrick or Sink.
 So the big question is this. How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable.
 That is the question and this podcast will give you the answers.
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to Mark D. Seeker's.
 Alright, so right now we are on a private plane.
 And I want to show you guys the moon out here.
 Now we're in the room of cloud.
 I don't think you can see this.
 It's a must have driven clouds.
 A lot of stuff to go at.
 There's the flight.
 So those who are watching this, if you're listening, you can't see it.
 But we're on a private plane.
 We're like, I don't know if I've eaten there.
 We just left Atlanta, Georgia.
 We left Atlanta.
 We left Cherokee County.
 Cherokee County.
 The airport.
 It's kind of cool.
 So you can ride on again now.
 Oh.
 And we are supposed to be really excited because this flight was supposed to be a beautiful girl right there and a beautiful girl right there and then Tod right there.
 But our beautiful ladies, AKA, are wild.
 They're not here.
 So Tod's daughter got sick the last two or three days.
 So this ride is like, I can't make it.
 And then my wife said, well, she's not going.
 I'm not going.
 So now Tod, we're running a romantic trip together with that for one.
 Because we've already booked the flight.
 So we're going into it.
 It'll be fun.
 It'll be so awesome.
 So I'll check out.
 Here's the moon.
 I'll see a moon shot.
 Yeah, there's the moon.
 Those who are watching this.
 There's the picture of the moon and the end.
 Oh, it looks so cool.
 Anyway.
 Those guys are listening.
 You have no idea what we were saying, but you're totally missing out.
 Go to marketingsecrets.com.
 And you can watch the video version as well.
 Anyway, so I'm going to finish playing a video about this.
 I'm hoping that I thought.
 So those guys are good clouds.
 We're going to pass the clouds.
 We're going to go above the clouds now.
 So we're legit.
 All right.
 So those guys don't know Tod yet.
 You need to know him.
 He is the brains.
 He's the one who built it all initially.
 And he lives in the land of Georgia.
 We're joining the movie "The Boys' Day" now for six years.
 But he told me no.
 So find these.
 I feel bad because "The Boys' Day" every quarter of the year.
 If you must.
 The person I've come to do "Lad Dang Out" even sees out.
 She has to put on him in his home, his family, and it's amazing.
 And tell them all about how cool we were.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah, it was fun.
 So anyway.
 And now we're actually heading down to a con.
 To a conference.
 Is it going to be meters where we're going to go?
 Clearwater Beach.
 Clearwater Beach.
 It's email marketing conference.
 Oh, yeah.
 It's top secret.
 We're not allowed to say we're not.
 Oh, yeah.
 We can't talk about it.
 A lot of the time it comes out.
 You can't yell me anyway.
 So that's what we're doing.
 We'll bring this along to see if you guys are happening.
 But it's kind of fun.
 And then check it out.
 Oh, yeah.
 Oh, it's so cool.
 Anyway, so I don't know exactly what we're going to talk about.
 So many things we talk about when we're like, we're on the planet.
 We're on the plane, this new podcast.
 I have one thing I want to rant about.
 And then while I'm ranting, I'm going to let Todd rant about whatever he wants to do.
 Because I want to guess I'll get to know him better.
 So my rant today, right now, I'm recording my podcast.
 Now, so we just know I've been doing my podcast marketing secrets.
 Especially if you've been working in your car first.
 And I just popped my ears.
 So I'm doing the weird stuff.
 So we launched that podcast and ran it for almost six years.
 Every single day of my car, podcasting, podcasting.
 But putting in the time, putting in the effort, putting in the work, we put a big following.
 And then about a year ago, we rebranded as marketing secrets.
 And since we've rebranded, we've had 3.5 million downloads.
 And the top 10 business podcasts for the entire year, our video podcast is the number one,
 not a like in the business category, our video podcast, number one video podcast, and all
 of my tunes, right?
 See, these I2s should like us.
 Yeah, your things, right?
 Well, apparently, like 10 days ago, they decided they didn't like us.
 And so what they did is they shut down.
 They basically, if you're subscribed to our podcast, you can continue to get our stuff.
 But nobody new can subscribe.
 And we've been like appealing to them and writing to them.
 Sorry, like why are we kicked out, right?
 They're like, you're kicked out.
 Like, well, why?
 They won't tell us why they said you're out.
 And it reminded me about something I want to talk to you guys about, which is very, very
 important.
 And it's never, never, never trust a platform.
 Okay, and if you're building your business on a platform, just prepare to be, lose it all
 very, very soon.
 I've done this multiple times and now it's happened to I2.
 I've lost, I mean, since we've known, I think, I mean, you know, others who wouldn't be
 saying, oh my gosh, I think you've done it.
 Where we're almost a dozen times, I contacted at least eight or nine active campaigns.
 Also, multiple times.
 Send grid, multiple times, I didn't get recently, just again, they didn't get it in.
 And I was like, oh, I'm not going to get it in.
 I'm not going to get it in.
 I'm not going to get it in.
