 What's up everybody this is Russell Bronson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast
 This is actually episode I started recording a couple days ago in my car and I couldn't there was a word
 I couldn't remember the word and so I got halfway through and I was like what is that word and I stopped it
 I deleted it and now I remembered the words
 So I'm back to do a redo of this episode
 all about your job and your role and your responsibility of as an aggregator of information
 So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital?
 We're spending money from our own pockets
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Bronson and welcome the marketing seekers
 All right, everybody so
 I am
 It's Friday here. I'm today's a meeting day and then
 Next week we have inner circle all week and then I've basically two weeks left to get all the updates done with the dot-com seekers book
 You haven't been listening along obviously I submitted the final manuscript the traffic seekers book last week
 So it's out of my hands
 But then we're republishing the first two books with a new publisher and so I had this little window of opportunity going to update them
 So yesterday I spent all day going in I was like I'm just gonna tweak some stuff and dot-com secrets
 You know polish it a little bit
 But after I got into it, I was like oh my gosh. I need to change everything
 like
 Like I want to read the entire book
 It's funny because because you know I'm five years in now since my first book my third book and I've become a better writer
 I tell story better all things like that and like none of the first book at least the first one
 I'm not sure I expert secrets
 I'll find that out in the next but the dot-com seekers book is missing all that like there's not good story and the good things
 And so I want to weave those things back in so it may turn that 58,000
 Word book into like a hundred thousand word book who knows that's right now
 And then I'm gonna do the same thing with the expert secrets book and then put them out into the into the world
 I'm so excited for that
 But as I was thinking about this whole thing I started thinking about
 Like my role and probably a lot of your guys's roles
 as as an
 Aggregator of information in an aggregator of content right like if you think about this like the dot-com secrets book isn't my own thoughts
 Right, I mean there's some of my own thoughts in there
 There's there's insights I found and things like connected and correlations. I've seen and stuff like that
 I take my own personal experience
 But but none of the information is new like I didn't invent it
 I was out there and I was trying to learn this stuff
 I started aggregating information from a lot of sources if you read any of the interested books
 I'm always like I learned from this person this and this like here's like 50 people
 I studied and then I took all those things I aggregated them together and from there
 I came up with my own framework my own process
 It's aggregating these people's ideas into a process that's simpler for me to understand and hopefully it'll be simpler for you as well
 Right, and I think about for any of us content creators. It's kind of what we're we're doing now that the difference between
 aggregating information and ripping somebody off is you rip some off you're taking from one person and just ripping them off like that's not
 I'm talking about I'm talking about looking at a whole bunch of sources and from there come with your own ideas
 And then always giving credit back to to where you learned the original concepts from which I always try to do
 I remember this is probably five or six years ago
 I had a chance I was hanging out with Howard Berg the world's fastest reader
 And I asked him his opinion on religion and a couple other things for the make the students read 30,000 books
 I still remember he told me said it's interesting. He's like most people will read one book on a topic right on religion or on
 Whatever the topic is right and he's like and they read that book and then that becomes their their
 Reality that that lens of that book comes to reality. It's like what I'd even said is like
 I want to learn a topic
 So I'll find 10 or 20 or 30 books around that topic often different angles
 He said that I'll read them all and then from that I have a different perception of what reality is
 He's like I'm able to see things from different directions and different angles that nobody else can do and I feel like
 as a content creator as a producer as an influencer as a whatever you want to call yourself
 info product market or whatever
 That's really our job is to go out there into the world and and seek solutions for our own problems our own
 You know things we're trying to figure out how to solve this we're going out there
 We're you know reading books and listening to podcasts and trying this and testing that and going to smash my talking this person
 And all these things because you're trying to get a clear picture in your mind to make it make sense to you to aggregate all this
 Information from that then you come back and you can build your own framework saying that you know based on my
 Understanding of the world and what I've experienced. This is the truth
 Right and so like that's what I've tried to do in these in these books and in my podcast and other things is that?
 I'm like, you know my rules to aggregate information. It's not to create new information
 I wish I was I wish I was like the guy who sit there be like, you know what blah, but I don't typically have that
 At least not often maybe I do sometimes but
 But the most part it's me just connecting dots
 It's like I see this and this and this and this and like by themselves
 Maybe they're not like cool
 But if you plug these things like this like oh like look how cool this is right like I think about the dream 100 concept
 I learned from Chet Holmes like dream 100 was cool
 I learned from Chet Holmes, but it's like how does it work for me?
 And I start thinking about my dream 100 aren't customers the way the Chet taught my dream 100 are
 affiliates and if I can do a dream 100 affiliate and they say yes opens up this category
 You know this thing to the thousand people so like I took his concept over there
 But then I had an insight over here if I have this this framework of affiliates now
 They work and like if I you apply dream 100 to affiliates boom
 This whole thing opens and then when they when paid ads start coming out
 I was looking at paid ads and we're looking at how we do our interests and our targeting all sounds like wait
 If we apply the dream 100 to affiliates to influencers on the platforms all of a sudden like that becomes this new framework
 Right and boom that framework became traffic secrets and so it's like that's our job is not just to
 to learn and study and follow one thing but to go out there into the world and and
 Look at all the different options. You know here's a topic you want to learn about
 Go study from 10 20 30 people so you get this this more holistic view of the truth
 The reality actually is and then your role in this equation my role is then to aggregate information as I see and try to
 produce and
 Assimilate and give back the truth
 Of the thing I'm learning right so for you could be whatever I say you're in weight loss
 You're okay, I'm gonna go out there and instead of saying I'm gonna you know
 I'm 100% key to ketogenic like go stay key to ketogenic and paleo and
 One of the other ones meditarian there's a meditarian diet now
 I guess so you only meet and then vegetarianism and then fruitarianism and then there's
 Blah like just feeling like study all of it and then from there you get more holistic view like hey
 This is based on what I understand them. I'm seeing like this is my belief is this and it's not just one or just say
 There's this blend of things right now. So you create this new category and that's where you
 You you find your spot your prolific zone where it's like you know these things. I'm sharing are are unique
 They're not unique to the world like it's but it's my aggregation of them that makes them unique, right? And
 Anyway, so that's what I want to share it yesterday and I hope that that it helps because a lot of times
 I think we're out there trying to figure out our thing and more confused because like well this person says this
 This is this and they're both kind of true, but they're both different like what is it?
 It's like well, there's probably truth in in both of those things
 So so study and look at and find the truth in both and and come back. I think that's one unique
 view I have of religion like I definitely have my beliefs
 But I also believe that there's truth in in all religions
 I think they're all based on on truth and so I don't just go and close off my eyes
 Like I have friends in other religions and other things I respect them and I enjoy it
 I figure like what's the truth that they bring that I maybe am I able to see or I miss it because of whatever thing
 Like we're in Fiji
 We're into this Pentecostal church and it's so much fun that dudes up on stage preaching and you sharing scriptures and and I
 I agree with the hundred percent of the doctrine of what he shared, but there was definitely truth
 I definitely felt the spirit I definitely like got good things
 I'm like I'm gonna take these pieces of truth and then I'm gonna apply that bring back into my world now
 I like now it's mine like I had this truth. I've assimilated that information
 I've aggregated it I can bring it back and I can share it and so it gives me the ability to to build respect people not reject them
 I think the the world we live in now the Facebook society is like if someone doesn't believe exactly what we believe
 We reject them and we fear them and we hate them and all these things. It's like that's insane
 Instead look at that and be like okay. I don't agree with that, but then that lens like that's interesting
 You know, I was
 How many examples like this I should give but I was reading my new favorite book called American Kingpin so good
 but it's the story of the dark web and it's the story of
 The dude who started the Silk Road, which is like this drug this drug trading
 Website right and I'm listening to they start talking about his beliefs
 And why I believe that and the guy was super libertarian
 He believed that you know government should have control over people's bodies and things like that people still do what they want
 And I was listening to some like man
 There's some really good truth and really good points in there
 But they took it the extreme of like oh, but what that means is that
 Everyone should be able to do drugs
 Therefore I'm gonna build this drug super highway and give everyone access any drug they want it and it's like whoa
 You went way too far off the deep end right?
 But it's like I can respect the truth of some of these statements like wow there's truth in there like like let me take that piece of
 It and not throw out the baby with the bath water
 Let me take that truth bring it back to what I have and then as I'm teaching my kids or my friends or my church or like whatever
 I've aggregated this information for a lot of spots and I can now share like what my truth is
 And so you can you can respect other people and not not
 Want to blow them up on on Facebook and things like that right so anyway, I hope that helps some of you guys
 But that's it's um I look like what what's my job for the next?
 You're 100 years that I'm here on this planet maybe longer who knows depending what I what things I learned about health
 It's been all of the 200 years old
 But like it's funny because I remember when I wrote the doc on secrets book
 I said I'll never write a book again
 They did expert secrets
 I was like I'll never write a book again and about that time I went and I met with Brendan Bouchard and Brendan's like no
 I write a book every two years. I'm like what he's like yeah, so do you I'm like no I don't he's like you're
 Own two years ago. You're right in this one and you're on one in two years from now
 I'm like I don't think I will say no do you just make that that's what you do you spend two years and you go out there
 And you pick a topic you're excited by you study it you aggregate information you like geek out on it
 And from there you you take all the your your your research and then you turn it into a book that you can now give the world
 like hey
 I spent two years on this journey. Here's the cliff notes. I hope it helps and
 And when he said that I was like oh my gosh, that's really really cool. I decided at point like yeah
 I'm gonna write a book every two years
 and
 It's just it's gonna be a thing that I do until I die
 Because like how fun is that like you wake up every morning knowing like I got two years ago out there and like
 And aggregate all this data this information bring it back and give it back to the world like the truths that I found
 I'm not gonna do it just seeing you know from from one viewpoint
 I'm looking a whole bunch of viewpoints and and you know find the pieces I feel or truth bring them back and then
 present them to my my world my audience my people and
 Anyway, I don't know about you big gets me gets me fired up as a creator
 So for those my creators who are listening out there
