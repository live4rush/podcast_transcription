 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast and we got something really fun in store for you over the next
 The next four episodes so when I first started this game back in the day
 I struggled throughout almost two years trying to figure out how to play and what to do and how to get traffic and sell stuff
 And the person I think everyone everyone who figures out this game
 There's there's a mentor you bump into and I am so honored and grateful that so many people have that I was the person for them
 They read the book or whatever and they the light bulbs click for them, right?
 But I'm also very aware that like I'm not everyone's you know guru
 I'm at the person you know like and I'm so grateful for all the other teachers out there who are teaching things who give other people
 The aha's I always tell people like our goal at ClickFunnels is not to get people to use ClickFunnels
 Our goal ClickFunnels is to help entrepreneurs to grow their companies
 And so I don't care if it's me that clicks with it click with somebody else
 I don't care as long as you get that aha moment and so for me for whatever reason the person that gave me the aha moment
 was my my first real mentor and his name was Mark Joyner and
 Kind of put us this a
 into a timeline like back when when I got started
 In this business. He was just ending he had built a huge marketing company
 He got tired of being the market so he sold off all his assets
 And he did this thing called the farewell launch
 We sold this farewell package for a thousand bucks and it was the first course I'd ever bought and I went through it
 like the most intense
 Crazy student of all time and I learned it I mastered it and I implemented it and you know that was
 Man 15 16 years ago now and he was the one though that gave me the shifts that helped me understand help all the things
 Light up and make sense so I could be successful and so I'm grateful for Mark
 He's been a you know a mentor. He's been a friend
 and some I've done respect for and
 It's funny cuz like in the middle of all the chaos over the last couple months
 He messaged me was like hey, I'm launching this new podcast called the mark joiner show
 Do you want to come on and be one of my guests and I honestly didn't have the time because there's some of these happening
 But I was like you know what from mark if you mark I would do anything
 And so we set up a time is later night
 We jumped on and we because it was like after hours my kids are already in bed
 Like we were able just to go and talk and we talked for a couple hours
 And it was it was really cool
 And so if you follow mark
 You probably saw that interview if not I asked first permission to allow me to to play it here on the podcast over the next couple
 episodes and so I'm excited for you guys to hear it. I think you will get a lot of value out of it
 We talked a lot about different topics and different things. I can talk about things
 I learned from him things that he said you know
 I discovered since then and just anyway, hopefully you guys enjoy this conversation. We've broken up over
 Four episodes, so this is the first of four episodes. So I hope you enjoy it. We'll play the theme song
 We come back we will jump right into interview with mark joiner
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still
 remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody we are live. This is mark joiner and welcome to episode number two of the mark joiner show and
 Man, I am so happy to have this guest on today. It was very hard getting this young man
 I call him young man now. He's to me. He's always young man
 I knew him when he was like this college kid
 I know right and now he's he's turned into this enormous behemoth giant that cannot be unseen on the internet
 You can't you can't turn on the internet without seeing Russell Brunson's face
 I don't know if Russell even needs an introduction, but I'm gonna give you guys a very very brief one just in case
 So I'll tell you a little bit of the backstory here
 So Russell and I met when he was trying to make money to to pay off his college debts and
 I'll tell you what man he he he and it had to convince his wife to spend a thousand dollars on a
 Program that he couldn't afford that I was offering and that started his online career
 And I I'm very grateful he credits me as his first mentor
 But I'm gonna point now where I'm learning from him
 And I want to tell you guys if you are a teacher of any kind that the best blessing you could possibly have is a student
 That surpasses you if you have any kind of humility if you understand what life is really all about
 That is one of the ultimate things that can happen because what that means is you did your job
 Well, partly and it also means that you got an opportunity to learn something from someone and if you've got a guy who not only
 Surpassed you in certain ways, but it's also humble and generous and wholesome the way Russell is
 You are doubly and triply blessed and that is what we have seen with Russell since his
 Genesis and the online marketing community
 When was it's probably 1991 92
 I didn't remember anymore. Well, when was the farewell package? That's like right when I got started
 So not 91. Yeah, so right as I was leaving you were you were entering in I was jumping in
 You were jumping in and Russell I tell you what I knew from the start Russell had
 He had some stuff that a lot of people had had first of all he was a an all-state wrestling now
 A lot of you guys don't know this but Johnny Hendricks the first guy to really give GSP an access weapon and UFC
 Thought Russell Brunson in a in an all-state wrestling tournament now Russell didn't win that but from what I hear Russell
 Should have wanted you see something I see a grid as people
 Anyway, this coma right now. I lost my life 22 and
 Into this day I regret that because it was so cool if I actually won that match
 I know right well fighting the guy and coming that close and I mean even though you should have won that that's bragging rights in it
 So this is the guy who was the first guy to give GSP a real ass whoop it Johnny Hendricks
 Okay, Russell thought that dude and wrestling is the
 single most
 Challenging athletic program in school at all so what that means is you come into the game with some mental toughness now
 I saw Russell's curiosity his humility the mental toughness he had I saw all of that and ever early on and I knew something amazing
 Was gonna happen. I had no idea the heights he would reach now click photos is on the way
 To becoming a billion dollar company and that's what we're gonna be talking about today
 And we've only got a certain amount of time because Russell is on a very very tight time schedule
 So what I'm gonna do here is
 After I give Russell a quick chance to say hello, I'm gonna I'm gonna rapid fire a bunch of questions at Russell
 We'll see how much time we have for a little bit of Q&A after that you guys have questions post them inside there
 I've got a list of questions that other people have asked
 But I'm gonna shotgun blast Russell with a whole bunch of rapid fire questions first, but before all that Russell
 Thank you so much for coming on man. I really
 No worries, man. I I'm so grateful for you. It was funny. We were
 Cleaning up something the other day and I don't know if you remember this but
 my wife and I just got married and
 by your fellow packers
 It was a year later just kind of disappeared for a year and then he came back and you just phone call with me and at the time
 I had this tape recorder and I recorded all my phone calls
 I remember I did this call with you and I got done
 I wrote on the tape the cassette tape I wrote a hundred million dollar call with Mark Joyner
 And I need to find a tape player's like actually listen what we said way back in the day by side
 It's not again and so like it's just it's really cool because
 I just remember you taking the time back then when I was nobody just trying to figure out my way and
 You were always so gracious your time with me and man
 I listened for for so much time
 I plug in the farewell package my in my head and I hear you talking over and over again just different concepts and things that were just blowing my mind and
 So many things that this day I still use the all came initially from you
 So I'm just grateful for you and you allow me to to hang out with you again
 I I love this. It's so much fun for me
 We're gonna have to find maybe one of the five cassette decks that could exist and then your universe now
 They're all in the trash heap of history all right
 I do I have tons of rapid-fart questions
 I just want to throw at you and this is not gonna be easy
 I apologize in advance because these are gonna be tough questions
 I don't know how quickly we're gonna be able to get through these but I've got some really powerful ones
 I think we're gonna deliver that most value and you mentioned something there
 You said you know I took the time to spend with you
 I was like to be as generous as I can with my time and I know you do too
 But as you know as your life progresses you got to be more and more strategic and more and more careful about that now that we have
 This platform we can get this information out to a lot of people. I want to deliver at is absolutely
 maximal value as we possibly can to the listeners of this call so I have some very strategically designed questions
 Before I jump into those anything else you'd like to say
 I'm just thinking hanging out with you excited to be to be sharing, you know, it's I think what I started. I mean what do we?
 15 16 years ago and this whole thing started like I didn't know it was even possible
 But I believed I believed you I believed I watched you as like Mark student
 I can figure this out and hopefully if anyone's watching tonight, you know, everyone's gonna be a different level
 Some people are just getting started some of existing businesses
 But I think a big piece of is just believing that it's actually possible for you because I just I just believed you rather
 Again, I'm okay. I trust Mark. I believe him. I'm just gonna do it and you know 15 years later
 You know here we here we are and I think for so many people the tech techniques the tactics are hard
 It's just the belief in themselves is the hardest thing
 So if I give you guys anything like I tell people all the time like my my job at ClickFunnels is to be the cheerleader
 To get people to believe in themselves and so as you listen to things
 There's gonna be a lot of stuff that comes up for most people like all that that that work because he's mark or because he's Russell or whatever
 It's like come on if you have seen 15 years guys a little punk kid who was just begging mark to get on the call
 And forums like geeking out and like like it's just it's just time and belief and and putting in the work
 So anyway, hopefully that is a good lens people to go through this because I'm sure some things we'll talk about would be what may seem impossible
 But I tell you what I do not think what we've been doing with ClickFunnels possible and here we are so you know
 I never know well first off it's ideas about 19 years actually because if it was 2001 it's 2020 now
 So and I remember having a conversation when you early on you were saying how do you want to become a guru?
 And one of the things I told you was you just decide that you're the guru
 Okay, the guru guru dim is something is a matter of perception now
 There are a lot of people who under who misunderstand that they say hey, you know
 I want to be a brain surgeon
 So I'm just gonna you know check up a shingle on a door and this says I'm a brain surgeon, you know
 It's like no no, I mean you have that that means you
 Internally have faith in yourself, but that doesn't mean you act like you're something that you're not because somebody who is a
 Real teacher a real guru something who's really mastered anything
 Understands it that the learnings never end
 Right and once you get to that point where you think you've got it all figured out
 I guarantee you stagnation is the very very next phase
 So I'm gonna dive right into these questions man
 And I'm gonna start out with probably that I'm gonna start out on a slightly negative one
 And we're gonna get into more positive ones. All right, okay
 So what we'll start with so if you just rapid fire if you could think off the top of your head the three biggest blunders
 You have made along the way and I got I got about
 Seven of these rapid fire questions like this. I want to go through some putting you under under time pressure biggest blunders
 What would they be from like the beginning of time or just like in the clickfunnels time or how far back we talking?
 Well, you know what up to you up to you because all of these lessons are relevant the lessons that you learned early in life
 Matter to you later on in clickfunnels as well
 And I mean you could you can say clickfunnels earlier on in your life. Whatever. Whatever you think is appropriate. Okay
 All right, so three biggest blunders
 I would say the first one. I think most entrepreneurs have this initially is because
 I think most of us get started because like we want to make money
 That's the thing and so for the first couple years of me being this business a lot of it was chasing like where's the money at?
 It's it's over here. It's over here. It's over and like I can cheat money
 And I don't know if you probably remember this
 But one of the big profound things you told me because this is like the same time that Google AdSense was becoming this
 Friends that were throwing up these crappy little AdSense sites
 we just click on them like crazy and and you know people were making
 Crazy money doing that and I was like trying to figure those out something
 I don't know if you said verbally to me or for such as listening to you so often you kept talking about like
 Focus on the phone. I'll build a list build the list build the list and I was like
 but everyone's making money over here clicking on ads on garbage side thing and
 and and you just kept drilling my head like folks on the list folks on the list folks on the list and so
 Eventually I started focusing on that thing and then what was interesting is that that led to
 To the list of people and then it started listening to like how do you act like what do the people want?
 It was less like what I wanted to create or what I wanted to like how I want to make money
 But it was more like like these people are on my list
 What do they actually want? How can I serve them like what are the things I needed to to create who I need to become like?
 What are those things and so I think the biggest one was chasing money and chasing you know the shiny object and and
 The resolution that was really starting to understand that the business is just people and it's like how do we serve these people?
 I think you know that I talk all the time like I feel like business is a calling
 I believe it's from God some people this from whatever, but it's a calling you're called serve a group of people and it's like
 You look at it from that lens
 It's like okay
 How do I how do I serve this group what I need to do and when you do that and you shift to that like that's when money starts starts coming
 So that's that'd be the the first blunder that I think that you know took me two or three years to get to figure through
 Another one I think is I spent a lot of time for a while like
 There's like the strategy of business and the tactics and I can get on the tactics so much
 I was like I was doing tactical things like would get me little pops of money or pops of cat or things like that or
 Or look at their traffic or whatever it was
 But it wasn't I started stepping back and started trying to think more strategically
 Which is a hard thing for a lot of us entrepreneurs because it's not as fast. It's like it's slower
 But when you strategically put things together and connecting that's when the big stuff starts starts coming in fact
 I don't know if you remember this is another funny thing on the journey. It was a podcast interview. I did with you
 Probably seven eight years ago, and I think I asked you a question specifically about that
 And you said the biggest problem you ever I know Russell's you're focusing too much on the tactics
 I was like what is he talking about I didn't even know
 And then it's step back and like I think first I got you know first maybe a little offended or like what are you talking about doing really good?
 And then I really internalized that like okay. What does that mean like well symmetry strategy and tactics?
 Let me understand that and then it's like okay
 Let me look at these
 It's not looking at from this tactical lens, you know up close like how do I step back and
 at a bigger point and
 You know that's where that's where ClickFunnels was born from was was us stepping back and you know part of it
 Was it happened because you know we had some some hard times in the business
 Where's like we had to refigure things out and we didn't have time to like you know
 We got a money to goof around and it's like you look we got to make the right move
 Let's think about this before we just jump. That's probably number two and then number three is
 I think
 This is one. It's just a lot of my lens right now is I didn't understand advertising loss for a long time and I think
 You know now now we know we have in-house legal attorneys and we've got everything we rewrite goes through
 You know everything I publish like we have to go through an attorney first to make sure I I'm saying and like
 I wish I would understood that from the very beginning because there's so many things that were that us as a market place are doing that
 They're illegal. We don't even know we think that like oh because we got this person's successor
 I can tell that success story. It's like even if that thing is true. You can't just tell that story like there's
 There's advertising laws that dictate that and I you know
 I think in the last two years is where I've really started to understand that and respect that and and first
 You know as marketers we hate all the the rules and regulations
 They start respecting and then it actually makes you a better marketer better business person
 And I think you can sort people better when you start understanding those things
 And so I think that's something I'm gonna be talking a lot more to our
 Communities a whole about because I'm starting to understand it's so much better and there's so many people that are having success
 But they're doing it
 Saying things that they can't they shouldn't be and they can't be saying so those are probably the biggest anyway
 Three big blunders for me
 Well, I tell you what man if this were any other guests
 You know I would be commenting back and forth and I have a lot to say about everything that you just said could not agree
 more
 With all those things you said but because we have such limited time and because you are such an
 extraordinary phenomenon right now
 I'm gonna use this time instead to shut up and
 Extract more information out of you because there's so many good lessons that we can get from you next three
 I have our now this is gonna be very interesting and this is one I'm probably the most curious about the three most significant slash pivotal
 strategic moves or decisions that you have made since the inception of click funnels who oh
 Man these are good. Okay, the first one is definitely easy
 The first one so my business partners Todd Dickerson
 He's my co-founder and he's the brains that that the bill click phones
 I always hope you won the dancing monkey on stage talking about he's the guy who
 managed and journey cuz I can't code like in fact that the joke as he was building it was like if I can make something so simple
 The Russell can use it like the rest of the world's gonna love to sing
 And so initially when we like Todd worked for me for a long time and we did projects together and he lives in Atlanta, Georgia
 and he fight a Boise about once or twice a year and we sit down and brainstorm ideas and
 I remember the time we came out and we we talked about building click funnels. I was like I've tried to build
 You know something like this before I think most it wasn't a unique idea
 I think everybody had tried to build it at one point like like let's build software that makes this whole funnel thing easy
 Like we all everyone had that idea. It wasn't unique, right?
 And Todd was like we should build it. I'm like, okay
 I've tried it before it didn't work like everyone's tried it
 He's like no I think I can do it and so we sat down for a week in front of a whiteboard mapped out
 Like what the dream would be like the vision like we can have all these things and
 I remember after week was done. I was driving him back to the airport and as we got to like the you know
 I was gonna drop him off
 he he got stopped for second said hey
 If we're gonna do this project together or this project, I don't want to do it as your employee
 I want to be your partner and I remember like that that was the moment was just like but I'm the entrepreneur
 I'm the one that's wrist all you know, I like
 the ego was like was just there and and I all sphere and all these things I all these things that were just like ah and
 And as I'm sitting there like I literally in that moment made the second best decision in my life outside of marrying my wife
 And it was like I said, let's do it
 And I said yes and like that little that little shift from like this is I'm the guy to like let's let's do this together
 Men everything and he went home and built click funnels and he has been to this day the most amazing
 Business partner anyone could ever dreamt of
 And so I think that's the big thing is that
 You know the strategy of getting out of your own ego and being okay with building a team and realizing you don't have to be the person
 It's it's you know
 I was talking about this fun hiking live
 You know, I think one of the big things that the entrepreneurs do is we're going on this journey
 And we get stuck and we're like how do I do this thing?
 We get into this procrastation but we're trying to learn how to do things and the question should be asking ourselves is like like who
 Like who already knows how to do this thing and then we you know, we we start assembling our dream team
 And if you look at any good movie series, right like the Avengers you've got Nick Fury comes in and assembles a dream team
 They go and tackle, you know take out Thanos you got
 Justice Leaguey like every good movie oceans 12 oceans 11 like there's all
 Comes in build the dream team and they go attack this thing
 And I think most entrepreneurs so have so much ego and pride that they don't do that and man looking back
 It was like that was the first time I said, okay
 I'm gonna have a partner and we brought another partners and and now like you know
 One of the biggest reason why I'd be able to grow is because I have this amazing team of people around me who have equity in the company who?
 Who like they're up tonight working just like I am because like they care and they love it and it's like they're they're invested in it
 And I think that was probably man
 I if I would have said no to that nothing would happen, you know, like it would have it would have been a completely different landscape
 So I thought wouldn't have been vested into the whole program the way he is now
 But now he's super motivated because he knows that every bit of effort he puts into it
 He's gonna get you know an outsized return way beyond what he would have received had he just been a
 You know an employee. Okay, beautiful. All right. What's what's the number two then?
 number two
 So the strategic I'm trying to explain it right
 Like when we first launched click funnels
 I
 Didn't know how like I had an idea like I remember like we created like
 Like the way I thought we were gonna sell like it was a was a funnel
 I think I actually said you a video about this we had a funnel and like I launched it
 We launched it. I was like in my mind like we're 10,000 customers the first month like and we launched it
 It was like it was like it bomb like the funnel didn't convert no like no a couple of those promoted didn't converse
 They all stop and was just like you know spend a year of our life creating this thing was just like
 and and you know remember this I don't remember this and you you've watched me before this because like I
 Didn't know what to do for a long time
 Like I was like we were launching a new new offer every quarter for yeah
 Seven years cuz I didn't know what to like I was doing thing out thing
 And so that was the patterns because I didn't know how to how to run a business or you know all those things and
 This was gonna be the thing we thought and we launched it nothing happened and then it was like I need to go launch something else
 And I was like I can't cuz like we put so much time into this and I remember Todd said something
 He's like he's like we have to focus on this for a year just to prove to like everybody this is actually a real thing and
 and
 That meant like like we had it just like all in and so with this point
 We're like we can shift to another offer a quick make money to like keep us all flow or we just burn the bridges
 So we like we had a supplement company. We got rid of we shut down like all these these side projects
 We just like turn them all off like and it was like
 revenue is like
 But like we have to focus we have to focus and
 And we launched like four or five or six different versions of the funnel none of them work and it wasn't until
 I got asked to speak at an event and
 They want me to do a presentation to sell click funnels and and I was like I've been trying to sell click phones
 Nobody's buying it and he and the promoter was like we need to make a thousand dollar version of it
 I'm like I have a free trial. I can't get people take the free trial and
 And so he basically he's like you're on this you're on the sales page. You have to be you have to speak and so
 Today's before the manager. I was trying to think of like what's the messaging how mine is sell this and I created
 The first version of this of the webinar
 To sell to sell click funnels
 Once this event I stood on stage and I delivered this presentation and it was like I figured out
 I didn't realize until did the title of the presentation, but I got the messaging right and as soon as I did that it was crazy because
 I think like 40 30 40 percent room who were like ran the back and bought and I was like oh
 My gosh like we got the messaging right and I remember going to dinner
 And I would Todd and a couple of the partners at the time and and I was like you guys just see no like
 Like that was it like what do you mean? I'm like I'm like that's the message like like do you see how people ran?
 Like I've never had people run the back and we got the messaging right like it's game over and
 What normally would happen in my in my prior life like cool. We made a bunch of money
 I would like went to the next offer and I was like okay. I'm gonna do that webinar at least once a week
 Every week for a year and I end up doing it
 Well, I'm born that I mean I was doing it two or three times a day sometimes
 But we got back home. I was calling every I knew we'd buy an ad like everything to this webinar and I did that webinar
 Every single day and like webinar would happen
 I do webinar get you know get the sales day look at the questions we go back to read them
 And then we tweaked webinar do it again tweak webinar do it again tweak it do it again
 I think I did that webinar live
 And it'd be like 70 or 80 times the first year live you like what I did it and I'm like no no no like this is my baby
 I'm not automate. I need to I need to perfect this message and you understand every concern every time every everything and we just we focused on that and
 and that's like that that that hardcore focus on like mastering the messaging of it was was like
 It was huge. I think some people like they try something and they step back and it's like that's why things don't scale because
 Like you have a good message, but you know, it's funny because I
 Wish to help people if you can get 10% of people to buy your webinar some million dollar your business
 You know if you're a little lower than that you're six figure business
 But you go from 10% to 15% which seems like a small incremental change
 That's between a million dollar your business to hundred million dollar business like 5% increase in conversion
 And so because I did that presentation 70 whatever times in a row
 Like I we mastered it and so we had the messaging right and so that was that was the first part and second part was the funnel structure
 This is where I made a video for you
 but because
 The first time we tried to launch click funnels was just like sign up for the trial
 Right anything because like it was hard. I couldn't afford to pay ads for the trial
 I couldn't go negative the whole affiliates were promoted was just it was hard then we had the thousand-dollar webinar
 You know, they got a year worth of click phones
 We promoted that and we made a bunch of cash, but it was like there was no cash flow
 So it's kind of this like I was back like in a launch model
 Which we didn't like that either and like the winning combination we figured out was we'd have some register for the webinar
 I'm thank you page you say hey
 The webinar is gonna be you know day or two go get a free click phones count and try it out
 Just so that when you come on the webinar, it'll make sense
 And so people go get a free trial and the webinar happened which would train the people who already had a trial
 And they hopefully they would they would retain longer and then but percentage of those people would buy the thousand-dollar version and so that that
 That combination was like that's when it was like it's on like donkey Kong and we started going crazy and after 12 months
 We ended up having 10,000 members that joined
 2500 to pay the thousand dollar cash and the 75 hundred were people who had stuck from the thank you page
 You know and that's and that was that was year number one and then it was just you know
 It gives me that we could spend money to acquire customers because the thousand-dollar thing
 But it was building up this recurring income at the same time and just that that was you know
 It took it from you know from the ground into into liftoff
 So mastering the message and mastering like the funnel was probably the second big strategic
 You know I really love about that is how you're training people to see what the
 Monthly cost would be when they sign up for the trial and then when you give them that big offer at the end
 Stacked with all those other things that become so irresistible because you're training the mind to perceive it a particular way and then boom
 It's a huge pattern interrupt with the way you do it
 Now I would love to see what your latest and greatest version of the webinar is I've seen a couple versions of it
 But I want to know and I think I asked you this before I was like man
 Show me what like the the ultimate version of it was because you're automating it now, right? Yeah
 Yeah, oh dude see and yeah
 I anybody watching this if you don't go find out the automated version of that
 And by the way, I'm gonna give you guys a banner that you guys can look at I think a place where you can see this is
 go to
 To this you are you are all here. This is the basic ClickFunnels website
 if you sign up for the the
 The two-week trial there you will probably be shuttled in to watch the webinar
 You start seeing the ads for the webinar. They're so up and you're
 One way or another they're gonna get you to watch that damn webinar
 You guys go to simpleogia.com/clickfunnels free start the two week free trial if for nothing else
 Just to see how Russell structures this you need to do it now
 disclosure
 My company uses ClickFunnels now we tried I've been involved in three other companies before Russell started ClickFunnels that we're trying to build
 You know the automated wizzy wig funnel building none of them did the job very well
 We use ClickFunnels now because what they built is so damn good
 I'm like it doesn't doesn't make any sense and by the way there's a classic
 Thing and I'm gonna say this very quick before I shut up and get back into questions for Russell
 But there's a very classic business lesson a lot of people don't understand and there is a conundrum between build or buy and
 The build or buy conundrum is this if you take your own internal resources and you build something you got to understand that that's energy
 That's time that's assets that you could be committing to growth
 Right if you can take a little bit of money and buy a solution that's already pre-made
 Often even though it's expensive it makes way more sense because I can guarantee you the time energy and money that it would take you to build your own
 ClickFunnels version would would be would be astronomically higher
 Than what it would cost for a ClickFunnels subscription
 So when you have the choice between builder buy you almost always buy unless there's nothing out there in the marketplace
 It gets the job done well
 And by the way, I've tried all these other funnel builders a lot of them claim to be better
 Well, I'll tell you two more things about this, okay
 Russell's is better, okay, and to the culture of the company is proven to be stable over a long long period of time
 I see a lot of companies coming out now
 We're like oh we're trying to be better than ClickFunnels and I'm like yeah
 This is coming from the same dudes that started 20 other companies that lasted six months and disappeared right now for like
 Lifetime access for 27 bucks and I'm like yeah, right right
 I spent on customer support alone. It's like there's no way you can survive
 Yeah, there's no way you're gonna compete with Russell. I mean good luck to all those guys
 Competition is fair and everything but you think you're gonna compete with this dude
