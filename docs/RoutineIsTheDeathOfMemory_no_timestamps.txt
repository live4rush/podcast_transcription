 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back the mark me see his podcast today on this episode while being so
 Furred by Melanie
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet
 Still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Everybody alright, so I am on the way to go and read
 Traffic secrets book for the audible version for the next two days
 And so I'm excited and tired and melley vault here to drive me to the office or to the studio studio today
 So she's driving me and I had nothing to do except for a record of podcast episode with you guys
 So I'm pretty pumped about that
 Alright, so today's episode is actually something I learned while we were in Puerto Rico
 So you know went from photo hacking live within flew home long not to sue our laundry and then jump back in a plane of flatter
 Puerto Rico the kids
 And then we had all sorts of issues with the plane
 Showing up like eight hours late and then we landed in
 Atlanta and we're asleep at Todd's house at night three and and then the
 Dryer drove us the wrong direction for an hour
 So I think it Todd's house like 4 30 in the morning and then we had to be on the plane
 We're so tired. We got the plane we get to
 Puerto Rico wrong side and the kids are pumped they go
 Immediately won't go down to the ocean of course within an hour of us landing in Puerto Rico
 They run to the ocean we all go swimming and the twins both go step on sea orchids and so we had that entire night to
 Available to us with the doctor to pull sea urchins out their feet
 So that was our first exciting day, but anyway the rest of the trip was amazing and the mastermind was awesome kids had fun
 We saw Ricky Martin live, which was cool. We
 Did a bunch of other things I can't even recall any of now because
 Last week seems like a lifetime way anyway, it was really good
 But I want to share you guys one of the big aha's I got there's so many good things that came from the event
 You know masterminds are amazing anyway, especially when you have that caliber of people like I think if you look in the around the table
 There's like five people had New York Times best-selling books one guy had ten New York Times best-sellers to his name
 Couple of people like three and four and like it was crazy all the best personal development and business people were all there
 One guy Jay Shandy had over six billion views on his videos Prince
 He had over three billion views like it was just like all these insanely amazing people and everyone's sharing their best things
 And it was it was really really cool, but one of my favorite things the very end great Clemens who owns a
 Marketing agency I see a marketing
 Company called Golden Hippo they do in I mean I came to you there volley, but it's it's not it's makes click fun
 It's like we're a little baby still anyway
 He's killed a bit he had a chance to a little presentation and we share like blew my mind
 It totally was counter to everything I've learned yet
 It was so smart and for the last week now since then I've been trying to implement this
 I'm not sure if you guys because number one it was little fine my head number two hopefully help you guys as well
 So what Craig talked about?
 He shared something said that routine is the death of memory and
 He said it first is like when he talked about like his entrepreneurs and business people were always talking about eating every teen
 You know morning routine and night routine and a daytime routine and routine I get stained or each minute
 You write books or a teen I you like all these routines right?
 So I've always been told and thought that I can teams with most important thing ever
 And then he comes in says routine is the death of memory and he goes on and says you if you notice the like is you get older older
 Like the years seem to go faster and faster. He said the reason why since it's not just like a thought
 He says it's actually true. He said that
 What happens is your brain?
 Starts you know trying to categorize all the things that are happening right?
 And so you have these routines every same morning you do the same routine right you wake up in the morning
 You do step one you do step two you do these things
 It's your brain will take all the things and just deletes them
 It's like all it's the same info over and over again, right?
 It's like you upload the same picture to Google photos at eight times. It's like we have eight of this photo
 So we delete the other seven
 You're like oh sure boom and it keeps just the one right and your brains do the same thing with all these routines
 It's just says okay. We've done this every single day for the last six months or year or five years
 Let's just delete them because you don't need them so your brain deletes all these routines
 which then makes your your year seems super fast because
 Because it just deleted all that stuff that happened
 and
 As you start saying that I'm like oh my gosh like
 Maybe routine is not the best thing and I do think there's a there's a place for routine like routines very good to create habits
 And do you know stuff like that?
 But this was kind of the the flip side of the coin is the negative side of routine right with most things in life
 There's the positive and the negative right like if you just
 You know if you just do the positive all-time use that becomes a negative and vice versa
 And this is definitely true with routine is if you're not careful routine is the death of memory and so you you start
 Losing all these memories in your life becomes shorter years become shorter and sooner just dead so I'm like crap
 I don't want to just die like how do we how do we save ourselves from this and so what he said?
 What was really cool? He said that the the the opposite of that he said he had to start creating
 We call event horizons and it was funny because this is the third time I've been in a mastermind group with
 This group together the first time we went to Wyoming and we were there we shot guns and we
 Roved fluent helicopters and we rode horses and we did all sorts of crazy stuff
 And then the second I went to Puerto Rico and was saying thing was amazing
 What a hike so we did like to the ocean and the third one was back to Puerto Rico
 We said the same house same everything he said was interesting
 He said that he said in 10 years tonight
 I was like I will remember the trip to Wyoming and the helicopters and the guns and the horses everything
 He said I'll remember the first trip to Puerto Rico
 He said for the second trip as amazing as it's been he's like
 I'm probably not gonna remember most of it because it was the same as last year as a whole and so like my
 My memory is just gonna delete it. He said that he said that you know that these other things when the vet horizons
 He seems that you remember that you stuck in your memory
 It's like a thing that you'll keep with you for the rest of your life
 And he says the secret to like extending your years and extending your life extending your happiness is to create at least
 5 to 10 event horizons per year
 Vet horizons are the opposite routine is something super huge is big pattern interrupt your brain will be like oh my gosh
 This is amazing and he says the things that caused good or met horizons things like surprise is going outdoors things that are hard
 Accomplishments danger unique things are big challenges. In fact, he asked him down
 He said right down like you're five biggest your five greatest memories the last year or your three greatest memories
 And so I'll run down he said how many guys was the thing a surprise how many things was something outdoors?
 How many times was it something hard that you accomplished how many times was something you're in danger or is unique or is challenging and
 Pretty much for everybody is like our things all fit in those things
 He said you know, so none of your memories were like I woke up every morning and had my green drink
 And then I ran on the treadmill for 19 minutes like none of those were any of our memories of the entire last year
 They were all these event horizons these things that that meant more that were different that were bigger for us
 And you start challenging us the fact that night well everybody said I'm gonna challenge you guys
 We're gonna do a better horizon right now. So don't forget this trip
 Let's all go down at nine o'clock at night and it's called skinny dipping in the ocean. It's gonna be amazing
 And at first we're all excited and then anyways funny at nine o'clock at night
 None of us wanted to go see
 None of us wanted to go swimming well
 I think two of them jumped in the swimming suits and the rest was went home and went to bed
 We're getting old our old age
 But it was kind of funny because he was just like we need to create this thing so we remember it
 And man that I thought more and more about that and what was cool for me is that this trip to Puerto Rico
 We'd taken our kids to it and even though my kids stepped on sea urchins the very first hour was being there
 Like they're never gonna forget that like that is an event horizon
 They're gonna remember walking in the rainforest and we're going the Ricky Martin concert
 I remember going to church walked into church on Sunday was sat down and Nora also her eyes get this big like they're huge
 I'm like like what's going on when she looks she's pointing and I'm like what she's like that's the mom
 That's the mom. What are you talking about?
 She's like that's the mom and dad from my YouTube show
 I watch and sure enough and two rows of from some church was this YouTube family
 She watches and her eyes were so big and all like went hour long
 First hour church we're sitting in this meeting room and she's like like
 Starstruck my little four-year-old starstruck like freaking out biggest smile on her face ever and then afterwards went and found them and
 Introduced ourselves and she got pictures with them and like she will remember that even um, you know
 We can have flander we called my mom yesterday and the first thing Nora says they grandma
 I saw I saw the I can't remember the YouTube channel the J the J rocks whatever
 Family at church on Sunday and like that is like seared into her mind. She probably remember that 10 years from now
 But I was thinking about just like the poor Noriko trip as much pain and how hard it was for us to get there and get the kids there
 And like you know half time
 We were miserable and there was fighting and like all the things happened with kids at the end of it
 It was like wow, they're gonna remember that then we got home. It was funny. We were
 You know, we were home for a couple days and then we were planning on Saturday
 Just like relax and do nothing and my friends called me on Thursday and he's like hey do you want to go take the kids?
 And we'll get snowmobiles right snowmobiles up to the hot springs
 Well sit the hot springs around home be kind of fun my first internet like my first thing was just like no
 Like I want to sleep on Saturday
 I do not want to do that at all and I started thinking about this concept like an event horizon like man
 My kids will not remember my Saturday routine of us waking up watching cartoons eating breakfast sleeping going playing in the rest
 I mean like the stuff we do all time. They're probably not gonna remember that
 I was like, man, they're gonna remember this I said the message to Klette. I'm like do you want to go?
 She's like, yes, I'm like, okay, we're gonna do it and so we did this thing and it was so hard to look up at 5 30 in the morning
 We jumped in a car with a knife two hours to McCall i know when we got there
 We went to the pancake house with similar roles the size of our heads
 We ate those and then we jumped another 45 minutes to get to the to the trail and we jumped on we ate
 Snowmobiles open eight snowmobiles rode for over an hour up to this hot spring and everyone was cold with
 Fun it was freezing cold and like all these things we got there
 We jumped up the hot spring just like an hour and a half and we ate pizza around this campfire
 It was super fun and then we like get dressed again. It was really hard because there's like 900 people in this little
 Changing rooms
 My kids are scared of seeing you know other people changing anyway
 And so we're all crammed in here. It was like uncomfortable and like we're soaking wet trying to get in dry clothes
 No, either about to jump in another, you know
 Snowmobile ride another hour and like all the things and finally we you know get them all dressed up jump on the snowmobile
 Another hour drive the snowmobile. I'm driving the snowmobile
 No, our fault to sleep my arms up holding her we get back and we have dinner and then we have to drive two more hours
 Home moves ended up being a 17 hour
 Moon woke up to when we got back home
 In clap hour just like sitting in the car fight 10 minutes
 We didn't want to get out of the car the kids were all sleeping in the back like I can't believe we did it and then
 Start thinking like they're gonna remember today like that was an event horizon
 It's hard and as miserable as it kind of was for the parents
 Not that it was really a good time, but it was a lot of work
 but for them like they will remember that like that would be something never the time with snowmobile up to the hot springs and
 I'm just grateful. I had a friend who was willing to pull me out of a routine and
 And give us that opportunity. So for me, I'm not gonna do every weekend some weekends on water routine some mornings water routine
 but
 Well Craig said you'll five to ten times per years to figure out
 An event horizon that you can do that'll just break up the patterns
 It'll extend your weeks extend your months extend your years and extend your life and make you happier and give you things to remember and experiences with your
 Your family with your kids your spouses whoever you you do your things with so that was kind of the message for today
 Hope you guys get some value out of hope you start
 Realizing the routine while it's getting some cases can also destroy and there's the depth of your memory
 And it's important to not forget your bed horizon. So that's that appreciate you guys all
