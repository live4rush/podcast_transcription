 What's up everybody good morning and welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast
 I'm heading down to day number two of the writing retreat and I wanted to talk to you guys today about a
 Question one of my friends sent me which I think you know obviously if one person asked me
 There's probably a hundred or a thousand of the same question and the question was all around like how in the world
 Do I find enough time to do my day job plus my hobbies plus my family plus my my passion and
 Also start building this business at the same time. So I want to dress that give you some thoughts my days
 And so we will dive right in have to come back from the things song
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right everybody, I hope you guys are awesome first off
 We had such a good day yesterday at the writing retreat and
 like so we're writing all of the copy for ClickFunnels 2.0 and launch and the offer and like
 Oh, it was just so much fun to get home into creatives and smart people in a room
 And then for me to have a chance to like share the vision like here's what's happening with ClickFunnels 2.0
 And here's here's how the market shifting here's what we're going here's like just
 Giving them the brain dump and then we literally had everybody all the writers and there's like I think five or six
 six of us I think
 everyone went to a different room in the in the penthouse and
 Close the door and we had like four hours like alright right here write yourselves letter right your VSL write your script
 Right whatever that's right so everybody went and they wrote their own thing
 Which was really cool and then the day we came back and had everybody sit up and like read it
 And so they had like stand in front of the group and perform it which was I think everyone was really nervous because it was like
 You know you're putting this thing out in front of it and you're reading it to everybody and you know most of our writers
 They write really well, but they've never
 Normally like present in front of a group
 And it was so much fun first off to hear them each present their own scripts like it was fascinating and it was fun to see the personality and
 The different angles and and it was cool like everybody had like their own angle on how they
 Presented it and like the hook and the story all kind of stuff
 But then like it was interesting because everybody's scripts kind of like bumped into each other in the middle
 Like we all use very similar analogies. We all use different things that
 It was just really fascinating like the cross sections of where things lined up and so what was done was like okay
 these are all amazing now what do we do and
 And then what was cool is we took like
 Like there was one there's one script that I think was my favorite from like the video standpoint so took that my headline
 I well, I was very proud of my headline. So I maybe I I bold those every actually
 I was the only one the road to headline if I'm honest
 So we use my headline that VSL script and then and then I took parts of like my the way I did the call action
 Then they offered stuff about that I put that in there
 And so I put all in the one huge doc and then I went through and I went through everybody else's scripts
 And I found like the things they had said and talked about are like different chunks like oh, I loved how so-and-so did this part
 I love how so-and-so explained this and I went in the Google doc and I highlighted
 Where those parts would fit in I kind of make I kind of like highlighted made a comment
 It's okay
 Let's see if we can weave this part of the storyline from so-and-so script into it here and then so-and-so's thing in here and kind of did that throughout
 The entire thing and now we've got one kind of baseline script that we're gonna be working off of
 And so today
 The writers are gonna go deep on those and kind of try to like do another pass and polish it up and clean it up and figure out more
 Ways and get it better and better, which is gonna be really cool and then some of the other scripts that we weren't able to use is the core video or VSL
 They're still really good
 And so we're gonna have some of the writers work on taking those and developing them into actual ads and and other things that we can use them for ads email
 Sequences etc. So anyway, it was a really fun day yesterday. I really enjoyed it and definitely gonna have to do it again
 So anyway on the way home as I was driving back one of my buddies messaged me and he's someone who's awesome
 I have so much respect for him
 he is
 amazing father he is on you know, he's got his day job, which is you know consuming and and
 he you know a lot of people when he gets business they just like will ignore their job to try to do their side hustle and
 This guy's got an integrity. He works hard at his job and he's focused there and then he gets done
 He also is a wrestling coach. He's coaching wrestling and then after that he
 You know as being a husband and a father and then at the same time
 He's trying to build this this thing. He's passionate about it, right? He spent the last couple years working on it
 He's been I know through OFA a couple times. He's been to fun locking live
 He's like so he's he's in it right just like all of you guys like he's in it
 He sees the dream sees the vision. He's trying to create something amazing for his family and so
 but same time he hasn't like
 He hasn't gone live yet. He hasn't launched he hasn't sort of selling anything yet
 He's and he's just like trying to like how in the world do I find the time between all things
 I'm doing to be able to dedicate the time and as you guys know the first time you
 Jump into this business. It's not just like
 It's not like something simple. We're like oh, I'm gonna learn how to flip hamburgers and do it right like there's so many things so many skill sets
 Like you have to learn first off like just the strategy of how this even works, right?
 That's number one then you got like now I know strategy now. I gotta figure like how do I create a product?
 It's the other whole like you have to develop a product which for a lot of people that's a whole brand new thing, right?
 Like how do I write a book or how do I create a video?
 How do I make a course and then after you rewrite it?
 Well, how do I edit how do I make a PDF how to make a video like like there's you know
 All the skill sets involved in just the product creation like there's tons, right?
 Then the product's done and it's like now I gotta figure out how to sell it and like how do I put it in a members area now?
 I've it you know after it's there in a tangible thing, but now I gotta figure out the words like what's the copy and then what's the
 Funnel what's the upsells the downsails and how do I position them?
 I need graphic design like the first time you play this game. There's a lot of there's a lot of pieces, right?
 And it and it's it takes time it takes energy it takes money it takes all the different things
 And so as I say that first off anyone who hasn't had success yet
 I'm sure you're thinking like whoa what if it doesn't work?
 That's a lot of work and it is a lot of work up front
 But after you've figured out like and after you get it done then it becomes easier and easier in fact
 It's interesting because a lot of you guys know I've heard told my potato gun story million times
 But that wasn't actually the first product I created I created some other ones first
 And the other ones took the longest but they took I made the least amount of money on them
 But it was my first idea and I same thing I had to go learn all these things now and I'm also going to tell you guys not to
 Not to be that annoying guy
 But like it was actually harder for me back then because we didn't have clickwannles like I was also trying to figure out
 How do you buy a domain name and then how do you hook the domain name to?
 Server and then how do you even buy a server and then after you have a server?
 How do you FTP and then after you have to pee?
 How do you like how do you you know get it to show up then and I figure out how to like how to edit web page in front page and then we had to like
 Like now you have that I kind of connected to a shopping cart and like it used to be even harder
 So I'm just saying that but I was lucky I was able to do it in a time when I didn't have all the other responsibilities
 I was wrestling and I was married we didn't have any kids that didn't have a job
 So I was able to I had time to be able to figure those things out
 But it was a lot harder back then nowadays with clickfunnels we've taken so much of those like the annoying things off your place
 So you can move things faster, but you still have to figure out all the rest of the things right and so
 Tesla if you auto drive it's really cool, but if you don't pay attention to it then it it cancels auto drive
 So I just got kicked off auto drive side to hold my steering wheel for the rest of the
 The drive to the to the writing retreat anyway, I apologize. This is a DD Russell jumping out for a second
 Okay, so
 Like I was saying yeah, I can't memorize that
 So what I was saying is like the very first product I built was the hardest because I had to learn all those things
 I can be so long to figure out the stuff and then getting copy written and I remember I hired some right copy
 So I didn't know how to write copy and like I paid him like 500 bucks
 I had which was a ton of money for me back then and the copy came back and it sucked
 And I didn't I knew it sucked
 But I don't know how to fix that I'm like God and I was it was just thing after thing after thing and then
 You know I spent all the time the energy the effort and then like I finally launched it and guess what happened
 Nothing nobody came and saw it. I was like oh man
 I put in like a years with the work and nobody gave me any money like
 And then I and then you know I kept trying and then try then you figure out the next step
 Which is like now how do you sell it? How do you drive traffic? How do you get eyeballs?
 I spent the next you know a few months trying to figure that out and I made a couple sales and what all of a sudden done after the
 First year year and half almost two actually 18 months for me first 18 months is when I started making sales and
 You know and it but it wasn't like wasn't good money. It was like oh I made
 The product I was I was I created myself for sixty seven dollars. I made a sale
 I was like I made sixty seven bucks. I'm like 18 months in
 Sixty seven dollars like if you do the math on that it was like a penny an hour or less, right?
 And I'm like this is horrible
 But what I didn't realize the time looking back now is that when it was like after I'd done it all I launched that
 It wasn't making much money and I wasn't the best market
 But I had learned all the skill sets I needed to do right and so after I knew it then I was like
 Oh, I'm gonna do this potato gun thing and like that went fast because I knew all right
 I just need a product. I need a videotape. I got edit it. I gotta put up a sales page
 I got like I knew the things and so that one instead of taking me 18 months do I did that next one in a month
 Right and the cool things I had met people along the way like I met someone who did graphic design
 I met someone who could write copy. I met I met all these different people and so the second time I didn't go find all
 Those people again. I was able to go faster, right?
 Well, which paid out got it made a little bit of money
 But not not a ton and that's like what else can I do and I had another idea for thing called article spider
 So I created that and that one went from you know 30 days got that done like I don't 21 days
 Right three weeks
 I got it done and that one did a little bit better and then I had an idea for the single form fortunes
 These are all these these are all the products in the in the cemetery of Russell ideas and that one
 I found something to create the product that product got done in in like five or six days
 At that time I had some momentum happening. I'd sold a couple of things now
 I had a list of a couple hundred people and so I remember I had that product done
 I knew the designer I knew the copywriter boom boom everything got done really really fast
 I sent an email to my little list and I remember to this day
 I had my very first thousand dollar day and I was like I had a thousand dollar day
 This is insane and then I was like wait now
 What's the next idea and I kept developing idea after I did after I did and we got better and better and faster and faster and the
 Momentum caused and created more momentum right because after I successful the first one the next one
 I had a customer list the next one got a little easier and it got a little easier and got a little easier and nowadays
 I mean I've got an amazing team people so we can pump out things very very quickly
 We've got a list we got it, you know like it gets easier and easier along the way
 The first one is always the hardest and so one of the things I found is that for a lot of people because the first one's so hard
 They're putting the most time energy because they're nervous like what if it fails what if it you know
 I mean and like and that you get into this like perfection in the syndrome because it's like man
 I spent 18 months of my life on the singer two years of my life on it if I don't do it right
 Then I'm gonna feel like a failure like I've been telling my friends and my family and all these people
 This is gonna be successful and if I do it in the launches and it's not successful like oh like what are they gonna say?
 Right and then and that becomes the real fear and then it causes perfection
 And they start focusing on like tweaking and it's tweaking that tweaking tweaking tweaking tweaking because you don't want to mess it up
 Because you spent so much time and energy because you're thinking that if I don't get a big return on this
 I only made a penny an hour and I'm gonna like a failure or I'm gonna look not successful
 Or it's gonna be a status decrease for you. Okay, and so that's totally understandable like I I understand that I relate to that
 Like I remember feeling that
 So I want to and so what happens is again?
 We get into this thing where we're trying to make it perfect and that that process of trying to make it perfect takes away more time and
 Every waking second all the energy goes into making it better and better and better as opposed to getting it out there
 Right and that is the that is the lesson. I want to share is that the way you you find the time is not so much like you need more time
 We all have the same out time right right now. I'm in the middle of launching four supplement companies and writing a new book
 We're launching ClickFunnels 2.0
 launching
 You know to potentially three other brands while running ClickFunnels magnetic marketing
 I know and all these things like like we plus I'm up with us coaching plus I make there's all of things right so like
 We all have we all have the same out time. So it's not time. It's momentum
 Okay, what I mean by that is is the first time you do is taking 18 months second time takes 30 days third time takes 21 days
 Fourth time takes and so it's because we get a momentum and so the biggest problem is to tell your first one is done
 You're not a momentum. You're sitting there in a spot working on getting a perfect and you're stressing about that
 you're worrying about that things like that and
 What I would recommend is we have to get a momentum as quick as possible. What does that mean?
 Number one it means we have to get out of the creative zone and into the selling zone as quick as possible before it's even finished
 In fact most people I recommend before you launch your product
 We need to start talking about it today
 You need to start publishing like instantly like the second you're like I'm gonna build a product or whatever
 It's like I need to get a momentum quickly
 So the way to do that is you got to start publishing
 So it's picking like either you're gonna do a podcast or a blog or a Facebook live or just a post on your personal Facebook
 There's something but something that puts you into momentum right put you into creation put you into like something happening
 So it's it's saying okay as of today and so I'm telling you all everyone is listening
 It's like this starts today not tomorrow. So today you got to pick the platform
 Where you publishing it and do the ones gonna be the easiest because if it's gonna be hard you're not gonna do it
 So if it's like the easiest thing is I've got a Facebook profile there for I will go there
 Easy singing like that Instagram cool like it doesn't matter
 I don't care if you have zero followers or whatever it doesn't matter at this point
 It's just starting so going and doing a Facebook live and saying hey or doing a podcast and make hey
 I'm working on this project. I'm writing a book. I'm creating a course about blah
 I'm in a document my journey here and then just start talking about it and start talking about it
 Start talking about because as soon as you start talking about it now you're in momentum
 right and
 Now you have a chance to put these ideas out there and he thought out there and like it gets you in the creation
 They create a mode and it takes away the fear of like what if I put something out there and it fails because typically most things
 We put out there initially will fail okay the first time I talked about funnels it failed it failed it failed for years
 It felt literally for decades before
 Anyone caught on but it's getting into momentum. Okay, so that's the first thing number two is like just
 Starting to sell something like putting it out there today before it's done like not waiting for it to be perfect
 But like starting to post something out there so again if you just randomly post like hey
 I was just a product. I'm creating anyone buy it
 It's gonna be a little hard, but if you start publishing in every day for the next two weeks you're publishing something like hey
 I'm working on the thing. I'm working
 You know and you talk about a technique or a tactic or something you're doing and then you talk about the next and next thing
 And for two weeks on your personal Facebook profile or your wherever you you have the ability to
 Publish anything you're talking about this thing
 Now after two weeks it's easy to come back say hey, I'm working on this project if anyone's interested
 Let me know I'm the future I'm gonna be selling this for blah
 But I need some case studies and some things anyone who wants it for the huge discount
 Let me know and and you can go through this process with me
 I'll give you the course plus you can do one-on-one calls me
 I just want to get some success stories and boom that gets you into momentum you can't even get away for free at first
 Like I am looking for some beta people looking for five people who can go through this this process is programming feedback
 We have to actually implement it if you want if you want me to give it to you
 Right and now you're momentum now someone's going through the course now
 They're looking at it now you're giving you feedback now you can make tweaks and changes
 But now you're you're not sitting back in the creative mode waiting and perfecting and and worrying about that
 You're putting it out there and you're moving forward imperfectly
 So I don't think for most of us that the the real problem is not enough time like we have enough time
 It's just we're spending the time on trying to make
 the project perfect as opposed to
 Emperfectly throwing it out there and trying to get it working like like
 Testing on people trying it selling it getting feedback getting ideas getting like making it public
 So many of us who are creators we create in private and then whatever we're we're selling we we
 Post it publicly right
 Ryan Hall they talked about it in his book
 perennial seller talked about
 This is the the problem with or not the problem
 But the conundrum with with all authors right like you spend a year of your life right in this book in private
 And then the fears like what if I put it public and they reject it and so the default what you want to do
 Is you want to keep editing keep correcting keep you know make because it's like it's less painful than putting it out there
 Right, but putting it out there's how now you get feedback
 You find it works what doesn't work you have the changes you get the tweaks and like that's now
 That's when the business actually begins now your momentum now the next variation the next version goes from 18 months to 30 days to 40
 And I would even assume like the first product and pronounce gonna fail
 Therefore I need to put out quickly so I know what the audience wants like make version number two and version number three because now
 You know how to do it you can start doing faster and faster and faster right it's speeding up the process
 But you don't know that until you put it out there. Okay, how many guys remember zip-brander?
 No one does it was my first product
 I sold a dozen of them and then it that was it how many is a member article spider?
 No one how many guys remember four and four cents no one right?
 This is the graveyard of offers I had to do out there, but if I would have bank everything like
 you know
 Form fortunes has to be the thing that works. I would still be I would still be working on it right now, right?
 I couldn't get to click funnels or dot-com secret search or any of my projects if I didn't put these ones out there quickly
 And so that's the biggest thing some of you guys have heard me talk about one of my favorite videos on all of YouTube
 It's by the Jack Dorsey the guy who started patreon. It's called work to publish go to YouTube and go to YouTube
 And type in the word work to publish. I you'll see the video and it's all about this like like we can't pick
 We're famous for it. We only get a pic like we only were famous with the market besides it wants from us
 And so our job is to go out there and to publish as much as we can't putting these main things out there in the top of the fun
 It's possible, but if we spend 18 months two years three years trying to publish one thing
 It's you know, it's like it's like spending the entire game trying to make one perfect shot in basketball
 Like it's not gonna work. You like you got to take a bunch of shots that thing in wrestling like if I just try like
 I'm just gonna get one shot
 So I'm gonna wait till it's perfect and shoot it
 You're not gonna win the match
 Like you got to be out there doing it doing it doing it doing it like you're putting in shot after shot after shot opening up
 Making situations getting things out there people to create opportunities for yourself
 It's the same thing in sports same thing in business same thing in publishing and so anyway, that's my feedback
 I hope that's helpful for everybody who's listening especially my friend who I think is amazing and is doing a great job
 It's just we need to get him and all you guys out there starting the process start publishing start talking about the thing making it public
 It's scary as it is and right now
 It's just putting it out there talking about it and people are gonna tease you people tease me
 I'm like I'm right a book like okay. You're gonna write a book like you barely graduated high school
 I'm like I know but I'm right a book like on what I'm like marketing
 Yeah, and that was be waiting for ever wrote a book and now hey, you know 15 years later people read my book
 But it's because I put it out there I started talking about it and started moving and getting myself a momentum
 So there you go. I hope this helps
 I appreciate you all for listening and if you enjoyed this or got anything from please share it somebody else
 If your spouse is the one who's struggling make them listen to 100 times then go to YouTube type and work to publish
