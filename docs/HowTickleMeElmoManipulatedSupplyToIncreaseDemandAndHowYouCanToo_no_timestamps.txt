 Hey everyone, it's Russell Bronson welcome to marketing secrets podcast. This is a special audio episode just for my audio friends
 This will not be on video and I'm in the car now driving to grocery store with my son
 Dowan down how you doing tonight? He's a little tired. It's late. We forgot you have to go treats
 He's always tired though. He's growing boy
 But he asked me a question and I said down we're gonna answer this on a podcast
 So let's cue the intro music we come back when I share it you guys something very very important to understand about
 supply demand and Christmas time
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still
 remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Bronson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody welcome back so
 Alright, so down came to the car and we were talking about air headphone buds
 And you want to remember don't tell me tell me what you told me down when we're getting in the car about the cheap
 How much cheap headphones are versus these ones? So I was looking at the how much the head but earbuds cost for
 Apple because I was looking at the iPhone 10 talking about the the air pods that are super cool
 And I looked up on Amazon these Amazon's amazing
 $850 for the Amazon headphones
 He said you can buy regular headphones for five bucks
 And I pulled out those headphones out of my pocket because I actually love those a lot if you don't have them
 You should get them. I said actually these sell for a hundred not from Amazon
 And I'll tell you why I just explain this to Dallas. I want to explain it to all you guys
 So I'm sure you understand this but this sets up the teaching lesson
 I want to have here in a second so
 if you look at the
 look at the the pods
 Excuse me
 If you if you look at them there are a hundred fifty dollars on Apple's site
 The problem is it takes like two or three months of the ship to you
 So if you buy them and you plan ahead it's hundred fifty bucks
 But if you didn't and that's like Christmas time you're like ah my wife my girlfriend my significant other my kid
 They need air pods they've been asking for all Christmas and you try to buy it you had Apple
 It's like hey, well, I've delivered tell me and you're like what but Christmas is in December and they're freaking out
 So they have to go look for other places say on Amazon
 They find people who had the four sites know the people were gonna have not have four site
 And so they take their their Apple
 Air pods they bought for a hundred fifty bucks in the jacket the price for eight hundred dollars at Amazon and the people who are slow
 Have to pay the difference and so I was about to tell down about tickle me Elmo
 And then I said wait a minute. We should share the story on
 On the podcast so so down. Here's the lesson a storm will tell you and everyone can listen on this so when I was a kid
 There was a it was right when Elmo came out since we should didn't used to have Elmo and then remember
 When Elmo came out everyone like I remember being a kid being like Elmo is the coolest like he was just so much cooler than all the other
 Muppets
 And we all loved him and then one year for Christmas came out with this what they call tickle me Elmo
 So you just have Elmo dolls now, but it's like the original Elmo one
 Or it was like a doll and you tickle into the giggle and like that was like ground-breaking 30 years ago, right?
 It was a little scary
 So anyway, so everyone wanted tickle me Elmo and so
 The company that makes them they it's a loss of supply and demands
 They made so many tickle me Elmo's and that was it and that's all they made and I don't know the whole story behind it
 But basically there was a lot more people who wanted him everyone kid wanted him is all over the news
 And so tickle me Elmo started going you'd normally buy them for like 20 bucks
 They got like 50 bucks and 80 bucks and people were auctioning for like tens of thousands of dollars
 They tickle me Elmo and then other people heard about tickle me Elmo and they when they start talking about how they're like
 There's none left and so one of them sold on you know an auction for
 Your $10,000 then people were freaking out people to have them were like well
 I could sell it's like make some money and so they would take their gifts away from their kids and to make money by selling to other people and it was just crazy
 Pandemonium and so the lesson I want to teach you Dallen and everyone who's listening today is
 The power of scarcity and supply and demand so when you have a ton of stuff like if there's a billion tickle me Elmo dolls
 Nobody cares and they're they're not gonna freak out and try to buy him and so the price
 Goes lower
 But when they're when they're the high demand form and supplies smaller so like the airpods like there's a high demand for them
 Everyone wants them, but there's only a few left the people who sell them can charge way more for him because they need him
 So a lot of times in our businesses depending what we're selling a lot of times. There's not typically that built-in supply and demand
 Curve because we're selling info products or supplements or things that are kind of easy
 But you can always do things in your marketing to create the illusion of supply and demand
 good example is bill Phillips muscle media when I was a kid and it was the biggest supplement company in the world and
 In fact some of my buddies now used to work for them, which is kind of fun
 anyway
 bill Phillips had
 Milo Plex shakes and his whole EAS supplement line and he had unlimited stuff right like he could he gets
 As much as he wanted, but they needed to create urgency and scarcity to give people to buy more to increase the price all that kind of stuff
 So there's a marketing campaign that I believe Joe Polish was part of or in charge of I don't know
 I heard him tell the story one time so I somehow know it's credited back to him
 Well, he did they they had two big shipments of supplements come into their warehouse the too late big semi-trucks full
 So took a picture of it and then like hey, we should make do it like a marketing campaign around this
 So they sent a sales letter back to the entire muscle media magazine list
 They said hey, we over ordered we had two big
 Semi-trucks of supplements in the front like we need your help
 Please like you know buy the excess stuff so that way we can
 get back to
 To normal life whatever and they sent the letter out and they sold a ton of supplements and then they're like well
 Well now we sold a bunch. Let's like let's increase the the
 There's decreased the supply therefore increasing the man
 So they took the exact same sales letter and they took the picture of the two trucks
 They crossed out one of the trucks and said one down one one to go and then changed all that
 It's like one left one left one left. They said the same letter out to the same customer race with all it did was it increased
 Or decreased the supply
 Therefore increasing demand and they sold more from the second letter than they did from the first and so that is
 I want to share with you guys down my gym to the car
 So maybe this lesson for you guys down and hopefully when you are like 25 working in a marketing company someday
 You're gonna come back to listen to this podcast episode and hear the moral of the story
