 So everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to the market seekers podcast today
 I'm recovering what happened on day number three of the funnel hacking lab
 event so the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't
 cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets how
 do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the
 things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain profitable
 that is the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell
 Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 all right everybody welcome back I hope that you're enjoying this recap and for
 those of you who are fun liking live you're like oh yeah I remember that and
 those who aren't you're wearing massive FOMO fear of missing out and you make
 sure you're coming next week fact if or next next year so if you guys knew
 what we're planning for next year I have a couple tricks on my sleeve I don't
 know if it does though it'll be insane so do not miss it anyway all right so
 fun liking live day number three so day number one again for the recap we talked
 about impact and income number two theme was one funnel way to date number
 three now was the two comma club now to kind of set this off we had 91 people
 this day came on stage getting two comma club awards but we also had 15 people
 who got the dot-com secrets keeping dot-com secrets next they the two comma
 club X award which is meaning to be eight or eight figures or ten million
 dollars in fun which is really cool the cool thing about this is it I saw tons
 of people posting on Instagram that like Instagram Facebook everywhere like
 fun making lives become like the Emmys or the Grammys of entrepreneurship and
 it's so cool like that that's what this has become like entrepreneurs there's
 not much stuff like you started business you make money you buy a nice car you
 buy it out you serve a lot of people you raise money for charities but there's
 never like a time to like reward entrepreneurs like there are for
 actors and athletes and everything else and so fun liking live has become that
 become the Emmys and the Grammys and it's been really really cool so this day
 was fun because we had a chance to highlight so many amazing entrepreneurs
 bring them on stage give them cool stuff so that was awesome but we'll start
 the day so the beginning of the day I wanted this one because I knew this is
 gonna be a it was gonna be a fun day so I wanted to start with Anthony D
 Clemeni so Anthony came and taught everyone how to biohack how entrepreneurs
 can biohack for more energy so we came on stage and it was so fun seeing him on
 stage he was in a full suit with bare feet which is totally such a biohacker
 thing so we came in and taught people really exercise other ways to get energy
 and it was really fun so it was our only non-like internet marketing type
 speaker and I think it was a huge really cool addition if you just have a
 read Anthony's book on biohacking you should get it there may or may not be a
 new book coming out in the near future maybe not near future but in the future
 he's working on now which is also gonna be amazing so that was awesome I have
 Anthony off stage then Alex Sharf and came on and talked about the billionaire
 code and what's fun is like my opening presentation for like live is how to go
 from 0 million million to 10 to 100 and mine is like more like your role as the
 entrepreneur like where do you need to be focusing your creativity at Alex came
 back and went through the billionaire code which is like all their phases as
 he sees in the business is transformed through I think he has had nine or ten
 different phases and it was really cool because it shows you like each phase
 like here's what's happening here's what you know here's why business here's
 how many businesses in the in in the world are actually at this level and
 here's the opportunities and the weaknesses and all kind of stuff and
 goes phase by phase by phase it was really cool for you to get like a really
 good map of like oh here's the direction I'm going here's what's happening and
 things like that so Alex's was awesome after that then Dana Derek's our
 resident go farmer came on stage and talked about the dream 100 which is
 really cool you know it's funny I've been talking about dream 100 now for like
 eight years ever since I read about in Chate Holmes book and I've been telling
 people to do it and I've been doing it a few other people done but very few
 people do yet it's the foundation for everything in fact I don't have Dana's
 book here but he ended writing a book called dream 100 he's like hey you're
 at the Ford Ford and I was like yeah I'm gonna find it here and write what I
 need it but the fore of the book was basically I told him I was like you know
 dream 100 is everything for us it's how we decided what we're gonna create what
 products we were gonna serve the audit so with how we're gonna get traffic how
 we were gonna like differentiate like everything in our business is based off
 the dream 100 yet for some reason people don't do it so I didn't come and talk
 about that and it was it was it was awesome so dream 100 was really big and
 he had some amazing images and videos of goats knocking over little kids and
 things like that so anyway dream 100 was a big thing and this is where we start
 kind of diving more into traffic so Dana talked about dream 100 how to use it
 for traffic kind of the level of partnerships joint venture relationships
 things like that after that then paying June came on stage and paying June is
 actually number one affiliate for the expert secrets book but a lot of people
 here don't know him he's awesome and he he drove me to circle a while ago and
 had a chance to meet him and gets know him and he's just an awesome dude so he
 got up and taught this process that he does he basically spends three days once
 a quarter and he films like 100 videos and then he's done and then from there
 he's got a team that breaks up and like they turn it into Instagram posts and
 Instagram videos and YouTube and Facebook and like and show this whole
 process of how everything works and it was it was amazing people were like
 draw dropping a whole week out like that's the process it was cool because
 conversation nomination which I thought about the first day was all about like
 here's how we dominate each channel have like your specific type show for
 each channel and his bike how to create content and push across all these
 channels you've been building up to build reciprocity bill following and the
 blend of those two concepts is really really cool in fact for those who joined
 the two comical effects coaching program we're gonna be giving you our systems
 that kind of blend both those two worlds together so that's a for another day
 but the coolest thing about paying you his presentation outside of him blowing
 everybody's mind was the end of it he showed a video clip of him trying to learn
 public speaking and he was on stage and he was so bad and nervous and awkward
 it's like this coach critiquing him back and forth and and he showed kind of
 where he came from and how how bad of a speaker he was and how nervous how
 introverted all these things and how from that how he's become this huge
 person now with you know three or four million followers on Facebook you know
 makes tens of millions dollars a year and this whole thing and this this
 transformation he went through how he had to learn it and earn it and become it
 and that was I think one of the cool things you see this person who would
 have evolved himself through hard work and I think gave everybody hope of like
 wow no matter where I'm at like I can I can become what I want to be I look at
 Payne june and look who he's become and I can do that if he can do that which is
 really really cool and after that then Alex and Layla Hermosey came on the stage
 what's cool about them is that since I've known Alex he's launched and and blown
 up three or four businesses and always kind of walks away from him and in April
 this year he launched a new company and from April till now he barely crossed
 the the finish line but it's less than a year the new company launched not only
 did they hit the Tacoma Club but they hit Tacoma Club X they made over ten
 million dollars in a funnel in less than a year which is cool and they did all
 through high ticket sales in fact I was showing his value adders like they don't
 even have a full value ladder they basically have two rungs and they just
 sell really expensive stuff and so they came up and showed their how they do
 their sales and their pitch and one of the big things they talked about which
 was so cool was like when you're doing when you're doing high ticket sales or
 any kind of stuff like like you're selling the vacation right like I'm
 selling it like when you're like you don't sell like okay you're in a
 vacation you got to pack your bags you're your kids in order to get your
 family pack that you're gonna find a ride to the airport then you get the
 airport you gotta go through luggage and then you don't you don't sell this
 horrible like experience you sell a vacation like who he wants to go to Hawaii
 and we're gonna be at the beach and you're gonna see like the waterfalls crash
 your back and massage everything like that's what you sell as a vacation
 obviously they got to get the vacation stuff that happens and the kind of
 same thing them like looking at understanding sell high ticket things
 like you don't sell like the work you sell a vacation like what's the vacation
 you're gonna go on and then reverse engineer that to get somebody to
 actually buy what it is you're selling and it was man it was really really cool
 so their presentation is amazing as well then after that we had a lunch break
 we came back from lunch then we did the the awards so we had a bunch of awards
 we gave out we gave our dream car winners I think we're like 50 or 60 people to
 want a car through the ClickFunnels affiliate program so we gave away those
 awards then we had Inner Circle member of the year so all the Inner Circle members
 who would one member of the month came up and then we awarded the member of the
 year and Dana Derek's won that which was cool and then we did all two comic
 club awards we've had over 258 people at the event but 91 of them were there so
 we gave 91 awards some people at two and one percent at seven
 seven two comic club awards which was awesome and then we did the eight figure
 award which is the new award this year and we had 15 people I think 17 that
 qualified at 15 were there that received their award is a big huge plaque twice
 as big as a two comic level one plus they get a ring that's like two
 carrots of gold and four carrots of diamond or two ounces of gold four
 carrots of diamond and like a super bowl ring and it was really cool
 I said we're making this thing the Emmys and the Oscars and the Grammys of our
 industry each of those rings cost us like 10 grand so we can
 keep away a lot of hardware Dave was like carrying out his luggage the whole
 trip and like hoping he didn't get mugged in get robbed because it was like
 you know hundred grand in rings at least but that's what we do for our people so
 keep on selling you know keep on getting rewarded by us
 after that then Sunny D came out and did the Sunny D ClickFunnels rap which is
 awesome and then after that and this one talked about for a little bit
 because this is where I wanted to take a group of people
 through a process you know we just gave everyone rewards and it's like
 I honestly believe anybody who's sending the audience could be on the stage in
 12 months from now and winning a two-com club award like I've seen it happen
 so many times I don't think it's impossible in fact I think it's probably
 what people follow a process and so it's like well what's that process look
 like like if I set a goal between now and next year I had it I had to make a
 million dollars in a funnel and my my life depended on it
 what would I do and so I kind of talked about that during my presentation it's
 called the 12 month million I had become a millionaire in the next 12 months you
 can get two comic club award and um and then uh and I didn't just talk about
 myself I had five people come up and talk about so I had Stephen Larson like hey
 if you had a creating offer that was so irresistible people had to buy what would
 it look like so he did uh supposed to be 10 minutes going for 17 but whatever
 70 minute presentation here's how I create the irresistible offer
 then after I had Julie Storyan come up and say Julie Kayne now if you had this
 offer that you created with Stephen now you had to figure out how to get this
 thing I created the right funnel to do what would you do and she walked
 through this really cool process of like there's two types of funnels there's a
 presentation funnel or an unboxing funnel depending what the offer was
 you know we would sell it through a presentation like a video sales letter or
 a webinar or we do an unboxing funnel where we unbox the offer and put it in a
 strategic line of sequence which is like your front end your upsell your
 downsell and so she walked through that which was
 oh so insanely cool that's number two then number three then John Parson came
 with say you've got this funnel now you got to make money how you do it fast
 he went through this testing process we learned from the Harmon Brothers
 how to test a whole bunch of ads created videos in a very short finite period
 time for like under a hundred bucks so we walked through that whole process
 which was cool and now it's like now we know exactly what ads are going to be
 the best and then we had James P. Furlig it up and talk about okay now you got
 this offer this traffic things of that how do you now like systemize this so
 you're not going to drown like most entrepreneurs do if we walk through his
 trouble process which was super cool and the bat meetings and how we do our
 bat signal meetings here in the office and then when he got done that Alex
 Sharfen got up and he talked about how he'd actually build the the all-star team
 that could actually do this and facilitate and run the whole thing and it
 was really cool so they all shared their stuff and then afterwards ever
 give me a huge round of applause we showed an animated video we made
 called the Justice Link and basically showing these guys are my justice link
 we brought them together to help my company and then I had these guys go off
 stage I said okay now how many of you want this Justice League to help you do it
 and we made an offer for our new coaching program called 2.5x
 and my goal coming in this was like 250ish people to sign up
 and to get over a thousand within the next year so that's kind of what we
 structured it as I made the offer which was probably the best offer I made in
 the history of my life and when the dust cleared we had over 650 people
 signed up for the 2.5x program at $18,000 a year or $1,800 a month so you
 knew the math on that but it was it was insane and now
 then at home in the office we're scrambling this whole week getting
 everything prepared but together in fact today I'm actually giving out the
 membership site access everybody gets started but the program is amazing to
 get it work with all five of those coaches
 depending where they are on their business like through a timeline they
 move through that we're doing a systems event where we give people all the
 trellis systems we have they're doing another event they don't even know about
 that they'll find out about the members there which is super cool
 and then and then there's a big cruise we're doing big party cruise at the
 beginning of next year before fun hockey live everyone come on and like celebrate
 and networking and go on vacation together for a
 for a week and a bunch of other cool things so it's really
 insane offer that did two four six three times more than I thought was going
 to so it was awesome and then we broke the dinner
 got every signed up and they came back from dinner um I had to go work on the
 OUR funnel because um I hadn't finished yet and I was
 obviously running an event it was almost done my team was building but I just
 came to things I want to add to so I actually went to my room before I did
 I introduced the five coaches again and Bray Co-Peters and they did
 hot seat coaching so a bunch of people filled in form of asking questions and
 they actually thanks like two or three hours they're coaching one on one with
 people which was super super cool um and they were super late doing that and
 they all hung out helping coaching and serving people all night long which was
 awesome so that was day number two the two comic club and we showed people the
 path of the process and then a bunch when we took
 outside the event to now take them to hold their hand and walk them through
 um becoming a two-comic club member the next 12 months because my goal for all
 those people and you just have you on stage next year getting your two
 comic club awards so that was the number three of the event I know can it get
 even better if that was who three days I made one more
 full day coming and uh the last day was called change the world had an
 hour like change the world so I'm going to talk about that in
 tomorrow's podcast but that is the next step so I hope you guys enjoyed that
 those were fun lacking life hope that gives you a
 good reminder of all the amazing issues experienced those who weren't there
 well if we give you some ideas some tips some tips are along the way
 but hopefully most importantly it helps you understand why it's so important to
 be there um I mean I would sell my house if that's what it took to be there
 uh because the ability to network with people and to go through the system in
 this process people always ask like how to pick my
 my um speakers for fun lacking life and honestly the biggest thing is that
 unlike most events like look at most marketing events or probably any event
 I don't know they come in and it's like million breakout rooms they try to teach
 everything you have to pick which track do you want stuff like that
 and for me like fun lacking life is really a storyline like it's like
 there's a story I want to take people through and it's a journey and that's
 why like we don't publish schedules ahead of time some people like I'm coming
 this one but not this one it's like no you don't understand like
 everyone these speakers was handcrafted to tell part of the story and they all
 line up in a very systematic order and if you miss one of them you miss a piece
 that builds upon the next piece the next piece and so
 I pick my speakers on one of one having high energy I want to keep the energy
 level high but number two it's like they fit in the storyline of what I'm
 trying to tell at the event and so I feel bad I've had friends who are like
 why don't you let me speak why couldn't I speak this year whatever it's like
 your message didn't fit in the storyline and that's the most important thing is
 not any of not me or you or anybody as a speaker it's the storyline for the
 audience and the attendees is the most important part
 and so that's how I pick my speakers is the story I need everybody to have
 to break false beliefs so they can actually achieve what they need in their
 life and so it's fun all right that said I'm gonna bounce and tomorrow I will
 tell you guys the last day where we had a much amazing things Tony Robbins came
 on stage we did something that made an extra three million dollars in coaching
 sales in 30 minutes I'll talk about that in a much other thing so make sure you
 don't miss tomorrow's podcast thanks everybody we'll talk to you soon
