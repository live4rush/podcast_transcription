 Hey, what's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast
 I'm driving home and drop my kids off in the snow and everybody's driving so slow
 I thought we should we should talk so with that said it's keep theme song and we will be right back
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out
 To the world and yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome the marketing secrets
 All right, so last week we were on the two comic club cruise
 Which was so much fun
 You should come next year if you didn't come for some reason
 Everyone should be there, but it was amazing. We had like 350 funnel hackers
 Out on the sea for a week locked in a boat
 So I was locked in a boat with so much people and we had so much fun
 I tried to put on my extroverted hat and go out and do stuff which was actually really really fun. I had a good time
 But I'm not gonna lie. They say the difference between extrovert introverts not like that you'll have to hide or not
 It's that
 It's how you recharge and so like extrovert recharge by going out to a bunch of people hanging out
 That's how they recharge which introverts like have to go hide by themselves
 so by that definition through max River Hat went out there and I
 Partied like it was 1979 until
 1999 was the Prince song the artist formerly known as Prince
 Anyway, I partied and my like battery got completely empty and I kept going and kept going and kept going and then and then
 We go back. I'd go back in rooms like
 In fact one night it was like we
 it was like an intense day of like networking and stuff and we got back on the boat and we were gonna
 Go to dinner with everybody and she was like I can't do it. I'm like you can I
 Room-room service and and we we watched the bachelor
 Our laptop had room service and then we passed out. It was amazing. So anyway, even us introverted nerds
 Can can party like the best of you if we need to so we did that in the cruise was really fun and
 It's funny because every year like we'll never do the screws again the after crews everyone's like please do a cruise again
 So we may or may not do it again next year, but if we do you should only come so you can be part of the Tacoma
 Coaching program though, so there you go
 That's that's the only way to get in and participate and hang out with all the cool kids. So
 Anyway, so that was last week and then we got home
 Yes straight two years ago to Boise and it's snowing we're from cruise weather to snow weather
 So now I just got the kids off school snow everywhere
 Which means everyone's driving like a half mile an hour?
 So we got some time to hang out and talk so that's my game plan right now
 Anyway, we're like 14 days
 Away from fun walking live, which is crazy. So by time you guys listen this will be even closer tickets are sold out
 for the six year 50 or six year in a row, which is amazing and
 I'm grateful for all you guys for giving your tickets
 I'm grateful to hang out with you guys here in two weeks and to serve you and
 People always tell me like oh fun like your life's coming up like you so excited the tickets sold out like you're relaxed now
 And I'm like I don't get relaxed now you don't understand what goes into the actual event and it's fun
 I like a lot of other speakers, but I'm a big fan of
 Me speaking a lot and then maybe it's just like to hear my own voice. Maybe I'm conceited. I don't know
 I just know that there's a there was a
 An event I used to always go to and I loved it
 I'll just say the name doesn't really matter it's shocking version event
 So I missed the very first TNC ever and then next like three I went to and it was amazing
 And I remember my favorite part was that Ryan Dyson perry belcher would be on stage and they would teach the entire thing
 um
 And those guys were brilliant
 Um, I love hearing perry tell stories and just like I loved it and then um and then like the second year
 They started bringing in more guest speakers and was like oh we've got less perry and Ryan
 But the other speakers are cool and next year they brought in like
 like a hundred speakers and like perry and Ryan spoke once and they're they're off stage
 um and the rest was all these other speakers and um after that I stopped going because I was like I went because I loved hearing from
 The attractive character of the business people who you know, that's who I who I enjoyed and so we started fun
 I can live I was very conscious of that like I remember what got me to stop going to TNC
 And it was the fact that they brought in so many speakers that I didn't get here from people I wanted to and so every year
 We have amazing speakers come in but I always have this thing of like
 I know that some of you guys will and I don't know some of you guys come to when hear me speak and so like I don't want to let you down
 and so I put a lot of um
 a lot into that and so every year I've a lot of
 uh a lot of speaking slots and so I think
 I think two years ago. I had seven speaking slots last year. I did
 six no sorry two years was six weeks speaking saw last year I did five
 And then um this should I do I'm actually I think I have to seven like I wanted to bring in some more stuff
 I'm doing late night session that never done before a couple other things, but um I just I don't know
 I love it. It's but the problem is there's so much prep work that goes into it like I have
 so much work to do um and so I have two weeks to do all my presentations and people are like well
 Russell why didn't you prepare ahead and do the presentations over the last few months?
 I'm like do you not remember? I rewrote I wrote the traffic secrets book and row wrote
 rewrote the other two books. I think we're adding it up and it was it was not quite but almost a
 quarter million words I wrote in the last um six months which is insane most books are like 50
 to 60 thousand words so it's like the equivalent of writing like five or six books that's how
 um
 how bad it got and so that happened and then when that got done oh and I did that during kids wrestling
 season and then I had church callings and all these things and so um that's why I didn't do my
 slides yet and then since I got done I had a week off for Christmas and I was like just trying to
 catch my breath and then we had the two callical crews now we're here so I got 14 days to do all
 our presentations and so there's a ton that goes into it um and so I'm gonna walk us through
 how I do it because maybe I'll help you guys who are doing events or things like that so
 what I do is um I go into Google um into Google Drive I become obsessed with Google Drive
 the last year and a half I was hated it prior to that now it's like my obsession so I created a new
 folder I have a PowerPoint folder for all my PowerPoint slides from every event I've ever done
 which is kind of nice to have um then I have a folder which is Fun Lacking Live and you go
 inside the Fun Lacking Live folder and then it has like 2015 since it's 67 and so all the
 the slides and past presentations are in there so I firstly I did yesterday's I created a new
 folder called FHL 2020 and then you open that inside there and then I created a folder for every
 presentation so I know my intro presentation which is like my most important one to me um
 I'm talking about funnel frameworks I titled the very first one first folder number one
 and then funnel frameworks and my second presentation is on funnel hacking so number two
 funnel hacking and my third presentation is a story workshop number three story workshop
 the number four is my presentation on emotion logic fear and so I did number four emotion logic
 fear then number five some of our five presentation number five is uh frontology number six
 it's traffic secrets number seven unlock sections to comic club number eight
 I can't remember the title eight's presentation oh I don't think I'm a title yet that's oh 30 days
 so I have eight presentations anyway so I made eight folders then since I each folder I created
 new Google slides and I'm obsessed with Google slides so the Google slides is great because I can go
 and I can build slides and then I can have amazing designer so Leon on my team is
 um an amazing designer and he helps me with my slides and so what then happens is then I go to
 all eight of these presentations and the first thing I need is like the title slide which is like
 the logo looks awesome right so I have that and the second slide I need is like a headline so you
 just headline you just picture me on the headline slide so um I do that and then and then third we
 have a slide template so what that means is like the bottom little like one tenth of the slide I
 have the logo and my branding and then the background slide I'll have some cool thing and so right now
 yesterday I said we were working on it was like working okay here's my presentations what's the
 the branding for each one of them so Leon's been killing himself making the branding and they're
 looking so good and then I go through right okay I need eight headlines like what's the headline
 for each presentation so I give them the headlines I didn't get through all those yesterday I got a
 bunch of those done then he'll design the task slide headline and he's designing the branding for
 all those so he's in the process now that I've kind of dumped those on and that he's going through
 it and designing each of the frameworks or excuse me each of like the slides structure for each of
 the eight presentations so we do that right now and then um as soon as the first one's done which
 I think I saw the first one last night he got done so then I go in and then I start taking
 my outline and I'll start building all the slides and in the past I would have to do all the slide
 design myself and so if you think about it there's like we have our right brain or our left brain
 right so right brain I think is the creative side and left brain's analytical it might be the
 opposite of that but you get the gist right and the problem that most of us have is like you
 create something like your your smart brain that's like doing the like the contents like creating it
 and then your your other side of brain's like what it looks ugly hold on let's make it pretty
 and then you're like designing to make it pretty and you go back and forth and so in the past I would
 I was doing all my own slides and so I'd have to spend so much time on the pretty pretty side and the
 other slide so I'd be in like the focus mode of like where's the storyline going and then stopping
 to like go over make the slide pretty and back and forth and you like you get out of state in
 state out of state in state out of state and it was really really hard and so what's nice now is
 having its slide designers I go I go in the slides and I say just in my left brain the whole time
 like okay what's the storyline like slide number one slide number two and I start dumping content
 on it and I know my slides are all simple it's usually like you know like a headline thing an
 image and then like a little blurb and so like what I do is I go right headline uh the blurb
 that helped for me remember the story and then I find an image and I don't put the image in
 an editor I just like link to the image boom next slide next slide next slide I go through as fast
 as I can and so it's happening I do that right now that would be my big project for days I'm going
 through slides and and trying to take the the process the storyline you know then I'm going
 through in the slide and I'll start dumping those things in there um to me as may wonder like well
 how do you structure the storyline um if you listen to my I did a podcast episode on how to
 teach your frameworks if you go through there it kind of goes through it but basically what
 do is I tell a story about how I learned or I earned this concept step in one step or two then I
 walk through the overarching strategy of it here's the step by step process number three I go into
 the tactics of like here's how you actually implement it and I actually do it and step in
 four showcase studies of other people doing it so that's kind of the storyline so I go through
 that and I build that out those four phases and sometimes one slide presentation I have that
 five times you know I'm teaching concepts so here's the story here's the strategy here's the tactic
 here's the case study boom boom I kind of go through that over and over and over again right
 and so I um I'll be doing that next probably two days three days on my first presentation
 and then by time I'm done Leon will probably be done with all the eight slide designs and then
 he'll jump back on slide and run he'll start going behind me and start um cleaning him up
 making him look like nice you know making the images look awesome and going through that and
 then I'll go to presentation number two and he'll fall behind me in three and four and we'll kind of
 go through the process like that and hopefully by this time in two weeks from now all eight
 presentations will be done in perfect and beautiful and then I'll go through a thousand times
 and then hopefully when I get on stage I will remember all the stories so that's how I do it so
 hopefully it helps you know most people it's funny you know when we teach the perfect webinar and
 people work on presentations on people who work on their presentation for six or eight months and
 I'm like you gotta move faster like you know I've got eight presentations in two weeks you can do
 one in two weeks um but you gotta you have to get back to this this process of you know fixing the
 left brain right brain where you're going back and forth and your perfection should I make it all
 look perfect where you're and you have to like figure out where you had to get and re-remember
 what you're talking about and like all those things it's like no you gotta move fast or stay in
 your even if you're just doing all the design that's fine don't design the slides right away like
 focus on your creative brain where or the whatever side of the brain that's that's telling the stories
 and map those things out and fill in the slides as fast as you can then come back later and
 design them or find somebody who can log into your slides and do it that's the most amazing
 about Google slides is that you can have three or four or five or ten people all in the slides with
 you and so I can be in there dumping things in I can have a an editor behind me cleaning things
 up make sure my words make sense the designer going behind that and making sure it's clean as
 well and it's um it's really powerful really simple and really awesome so anywho hope it helps
