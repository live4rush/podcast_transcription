 Good morning everybody, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing seekers podcast. I just dropped my kids off of school
 And now we get a hangout
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 Hey everyone, I hope you guys are doing amazing I
 I am trying to get on a better
 Rhythm of doing podcasts
 Consistently I have this really weird thing where like I'll get in the mood and I'll do like 10 in a row
 And then I get out of the mood and I won't do something for a little while and try any more consistent
 We're getting two or three week and so I apologize for inconsistency
 But I'm grateful for you guys and for listening in and and hopefully you get good stuff each time
 You know, it's been fun doing this now for you know 500 plus episodes if you haven't gotten the marketing secrets
 Blackbook yet go to marketing seekers comm slash black book
 But some of these I know some of you know Julie's story and I went through and
 She listened to every episode and then took notes on them all and then rewrote them into like a book of the top 99
 Takeaways from this podcast. So shortcut your life a little bit go and get those
 Print them out as everyone's been doing printing mountain read them
 But it'll catch you up on the marketing secrets the last five years of the best and most important aha's and things like that
 But I thought free be for you guys, but
 Today I had a specific thing I want to share with you guys. I've been wanting to talk about this for a little while, but
 Spend life's a little crazy right now trying to get done some big projects this month of October's crazy
 Speaking all over and flying to much places
 We're doing an advanced to comic club X members and how much other things
 Rebuilding the whole company structure. We are anyway, I can go on audits, but it's so much fun. I love what we do
 I love we can play this game every day
 anyway, but
 What I want to share today is it was kind of fun actually Stephen Larson was the office of the day
 So me as now we launched the one funnel way challenge, which has been nuts
 We had over 7500 people sign up for it. It's a hundred dollar challenge
 So so many 500 feet or excuse me. Yes, 7500 people pay a hundred bucks a part of it and every day for 30 days
 Stephen jumps on and yells at everybody and pushes them forward through some curriculum that
 We're taking people through and it gets called the one funnel way challenge. Why do you guys part of it? If you're not part of it then
 Because you're gonna pay attention to the 30 days calm launch video recently, but anyway for all the guys who are in there
 It's been so much fun and so it's fun though because Stephen comes in the office every day
 Which is you know, I miss having him there. He used to be there every day and you know
 He had to go out and start his own business and all kind of stuff, which I am proud of him for
 No, it's season is really cool
 But I'm very grateful to be able to kind of pull him into that because it's fun to see him every day and see him
 In his element like what he's jumping on and training and motivating and pushing and just doing his thing and it's it's it's amazing
 It's it's the this new program the one for my challenge is gonna change a ton of people's lives
 And I'm excited for all you guys who are going through it
 but I digress there is my one telling the story since he was in the office and we're talking on a bunch of stuff and
 We're actually talking about the the two comic Club X coaching program, which is something we sold at last fun hiking live and
 I think we had
 650-ish people join it and it's not a cheap program
 it's 18 grand a year or $1,800 a month and
 A lot of people came in at the $10 a month, which obviously is not a cheap investment
 but at the same time like I talked about when we sold I was like it's less than
 Half the cost of a crappy employee, right?
 like in your getting access all these coaches and all these things and
 So far we've done three or four events
 I'm doing a two-day event this month that only them are allowed to come to and it's it's it's expensive
 but it's also super cheap here. I mean and
 and we're talking about some people that dropped out of it for whatever reason and and simply let drop out for
 general reasons I don't understand that but
 the story I'm going to tell you today was interesting was about Stephen's sister Marie and
 she joined the program and
 that she's like a group of a bunch of people that join the probably shouldn't have joined right like it's like I
 Think for some people like it was as much money as they were making at the time
 And they still just jumped in because they're like they saw the vision they wanted the thing and they jumped in and so
 Was interesting the Stephen tell me the story is it like two months of the program
 I think it was the second or the third month the next eighteen hundred dollar month payment came up and she was freaking out and
 And had kind of thing
 It was like oh my gosh, and I'm making a money for this like I can't do this
 I need to drop out and she told Stephen like I can't do this I need to be out of it and
 Stephen listened to her talk about like, you know
 All the reason why she needed to drop out and he's like he listened to it and after after she had done saying all the reasons
 why she should drop out then he said or you should lean in and
 That is the message for today
 She said or you should lean in like what does that mean?
 She should lean into instead of like freakin out. Oh, I can't handle it said
 Let's lean into us. It's double down. Let's go all in and when you do that's amazing things happen into Marie's credit
 She did she leaned in
 during that time got through the scary bumpy this and launched her business and
 Right now her business is doing somewhere between eight and ten thousand dollars a month
 Which is amazing and insane and so cool. She's helping people launch podcasting like you're it's like my
 Podcast if I was working or I would record us at send to her then she just somehow made you can magically chill on iTunes, right?
 My brother does that for me
 But that's what she does for people now and she's killing it
 But it's because during the you know the the turbulent times they're like, oh right backing on running away
 She leaned in right and I want to think about like everything great that's ever happened in your life, right?
 For those who
 Were into sports think about like the hardest times the times and I only know wrestling whoa, I only know wrestling
 That's my world, right? But like the times where I needed to cut weight or I had to go get someone who was rudely
 Tough or I lost a match whatever like those were the times you want to quit right?
 Right? I'm out. I'm back and she's back out and walk away from it
 But it was in those times when instead of backing out I leaned in that I had success
 Yesterday it was kind of fun. We were working on a video and I was like I need all my old wrestling matches from back in the day
 And so my my brother Scott he had him all his hard drive
 And so he dumped him all into Google Drive and so I was looking at all these old videos and me through high school
 Through college wrestling and so I was kind of going down this this John down memory lane, right?
 And I saw in there the match my junior year where I lost to this guy named Nick Freshwas very first match this season and I remember
 I remember this because we recorded it
 But I think my mom accidentally recorded over it or something like that
 But we have like on a 22 second clip of that match and it was when Nick did this move on me
 That it was the move that he beat me with and I remember my dad used to watch that 22 second clip over and over and over and over
 And I'd come up and
 During the season I wake up in the mornings and he upstairs watching it and say Russell's coming here
 He's sitting down on the carpet
 He's like can I show me how to move work and we would drill it and go the wrestling lane
 We drill the move and like man
 We must watch that 22 second clip of my loss like a thousand times
 Or more during the next four months of the wrestling season and we and we're practicing practice and practice it
 And yesterday I found the match of me winning the state title
 I remember watching it and seeing as I did that move the same move
 He did on me to beat me the first season the same move I used on him to beat him in the state finals and
 I was thinking that I was like in context of this whole concept Stephen shared me about leaning in
 I was just like man if I wouldn't have leaned in
 To that if I'd been like oh my gosh, I lost him had fear and and all these things then I never would have been a state champ
 which man the
 The you know life circumstances since that moment that brought me to wear him today
 You know all hinged upon that moment like it's kind of crazy if we were to go back in time that far
 Right so in sports like like the times it was the most painful and the scary thing that freaked out about the most
 So I leaned in is when greatness came right I think about my marriage like I love my wife
 I love my kids, but marriage isn't easy. I thought it was gonna be I'm gonna lie if I was to go back
 you know to Russell 20 years ago I was like
 Struggling through life just waiting to be remarried then everything will be good
 My marriage has been amazing
 But man it's been hard and I think my wife agreed I guess way harder than we thought like and
 It's those times where it's like hard or it's like man
 It'd be so easy just like huh like like back out like I can't afford a mother payment booing back out right?
 But instead I leaned in and was like I love her. I love like I've committed to this
 I'm doing it and because of that's how we've made a marriage that wasn't just good when marriage is that's great, right?
 I think about in business like how many times
 How many times I could tell you the stories and me going up, you know building a company and crashing it and building and crashing it I'm working on
 We're doing a this
 Event in Utah the drive our comedy club in two weeks
 I guess we can have now and I want to make an outline of like the history of my my business right so into the little way back
 Machine I tried to find every single funnel that I've ever built and I forgot how much stuff I've done
 How many software products we want how many info products how many courses how many viral sites how many list building sites how many
 It's crazy. I haven't finished the list yet
 I'm already at ten pages of links to funnels that I built and these aren't just like every page in the funnel because I
 Can't the way back machine way back shows you like snapshots of the websites back as far back as since way back machine
 Was created right if you're gonna use a way back machine by the way you should go go to archive org in fact
 Do this for fun go to archive org
 This way back machine type in dot com secrets calm like my site and go look at the history my site
 You'll see you'll see like every variation of the Russell over the last ten years on that site like every blog
 I launched on everything and like anyway
 It's funny to the back you know the history of these things and so I went to way back machine
 And I'm trying to find all these things and you can't see up sells down
 so so I could just find the landing page of of
 Every funnel I've ever created in my life and it's ten pages now funnels right?
 I'm going through this. I'm laughing at some some of the worst ideas ever some that were like
 Completely bomb some that I spent literally millions of dollars on that never went live
 In fact there were two or three I found I was just like sick to my stomach guys like I spent four years of my life
 I had six full-time developers. I was paying I don't know million half too many year for these guys and none of these ever
 So I'll die today like oh
 Some of them were the precursors the click funnel
 They were click calm calm calm was the precursor to click funnels and I saw this thing like that was one
 We were literally spent I'd say conservatively
 Man at least at least a million probably closer to two or three million
 We spent on that thing and I found all the screenshots all the everything but it never went live nobody ever saw it
 Oh
 But had I'm not have leaned into that and tried to build that I
 Like we wouldn't be at click funnels today, right?
 I think they're like five different software programs we created
 They're all precursors to click funnels one was an RSS out responder one was a desktop out responder one was a funnel building software
 One was a shopping cart like all these things I tried to build it failed, right?
 I found the site champion sound this is like I was in the brink of bankruptcy
 Right literally like I had just had a fire like eighty of my employees moved from a 20,000 square foot office to 2,000
 I had hundred fifty thousand dollars in iris back taxes
 I own I was trying to figure out how in the world to save the company and save myself from bankruptcy and and if I'm
 Gonna be in crap, but I still had all this outstanding coaching liability
 So I would have like destroyed my reputation
 So I was like on the same way if I would have given up
 I would have gone to jail and destroyed my reputation
 So I can't give up I have to lean in and be forced to and remember I had I was on this
 I was on flippa.com trying to buy
 Website they're trying to figure out my future and like two o'clock in the morning
 I saw the site called champion sound calm. It's just plug that in the way that machine
 You'll see what it is
 Anyway, but it was an email text message odd responder for bands and I was like oh my gosh
 Just to be the great thing the world I could start the same we sell to bands
 But I was like I could read I could like remark or launch
 You know, I clone the site and launch an email text message odd responder for dentists and for chiropractors
 I was like this is the future of my business
 So I leaned in took $20,000. I didn't have bought the website and it was crazy as when we tried to make it go live
 Or like when after I bought it they tried to transfer to me to me they're like I
 Give maxes my servant like no, no, I need a server that can run Ruby on rails
 I was like what's Ruby on rails and like also like a different language. I'm like what and I never heard that word before and I remember
 Then the development guys ahead at I'm talking to my team at time new Ruby on rails
 I tried to hire people on Odesk to do Ruby on rails. I couldn't find anyone that could do it
 And after three or four months of trying to find somebody who get edit the software because like everything's they installed and they left and then like all these things were broken
 wasn't working all the customers were angry and
 was horrible so I
 literally
 After about three months that I was like I just wasted $20,000 to have and like just shut it down the servers were like a thousand bucks a month
 to they're super expensive as I just shut it down like and I was packing my bag so they was walking out and
 As I walked away from my desk I stopped for a second. I was like wait a minute
 I wonder if there's anyone on my list from those Ruby on rails
 Which is a stupid thing to say because at the time I list was a bunch of like business opportunity seekers and and they weren't programmers
 Developers but had that thought in my head so I walked back into my desk I leaned in right send an email to my list saying
 if you know Ruby on rails I'm looking for partner and that email happened to land in the inbox of
 Somebody who had bought in my micro continuity product like five years earlier happened to my email list
 But because my subject line said Ruby on rails and partner
 He saw that and he said I'm looking for a partnership with with some you know with the marketer
 I know Ruby on rails and it was Todd Dickerson who responded back and anyone knows my story knows it Todd
 Is my co-founder clickf
 Everything's up in business something's gonna be down
 Somewhere outside the guys the blow links behind me
 You know when when you're up in business you're gonna be down in your in your spiritual life when you're up in your spiritual life
 Your business is gonna go down or you're up in your personal health your business will clap
 You know your marriage will collapse and there's always gonna be ups and downs
 And I don't think anyone's ever had it where everything's perfect all the time. It's so life be too easy
 And so kind of kind of cycles like that I say you know whatever season your life
 You're in weird in that hard time instead of like running away from that hard thing do what?
 Marie said everybody Steven said to Marie and be like lean in like yeah, you could you could walk away
 Yeah, there's my relation to this, but you know, it's right. You know, it's good. You've committed to it
 Let's lean in instead of step away and if you do that
 I promise you greatness is on just on the other side of that if anybody wouldn't have leaned in wherever she be today
 With that company ever be there with all the people she's serving now
 Would she be able to serve them probably not right if I would have leaned into sports whatever got my
 You ever become a state champ and all American and Russell College and end up in Boise where I needed to be to be able to create click fun
 I was right in my marriage all the hard times
 I want to lean in what I'd be wearing today with my amazing wife and amazing kids. Oh, I got the coolest kids in the world
 We were
 Last night we were downstairs because we're redoing our bedrooms or
 Slipping down the basement right now and on the big screen. I wanted to show my wife a video
 So show the video and then we started looking at all the videos in our camera roll and then somehow I'm I don't know how this works, but
 Some of our iTunes on my on the big screen TV. They had all these clips from way back in the day
 So somehow got saved iTunes iCloud
 I don't know something so watching these videos of our kids back from like like eight and he was eight years old now
 These videos are him when he was like a newborn and and there's this one. Here's probably like
 Maybe maybe three years old and he had on Ellie's swimsuits
 It's like pink and purple swimsuit and he's dancing and we're like crying laughing
 watching him dancing and in the video clips like eight and someday we're gonna send this to your wife and
 He's like mom why don't you send it to her right now?
 His little stick legs dancing in her swimsuit and like oh
 I'm sitting there just laughing our faces off as like man. There are so many times
 In this marriage where either of us could have walked away, right?
 So many times in our relationship and it's like sitting here and just
 Laughing at that and realizing how happy we are like how grateful we are for each other and how grateful for our amazing kids
 Right, but that that didn't come
 You know from from stepping away from the challenge it came from from leaning in so there's a message for today
 Thank you, Stephen Larson for sharing that with me the other day
 He said it kind of in passing that big impact on me and once there with you guys and hopefully that will help someone in your moment
 Of struggle in any area of your life just remember to lean in thanks so much and we'll talk to you soon
