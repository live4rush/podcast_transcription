 Hey, what's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast
 For today's episode, I want to quote myself
 If you are good at something they should turn it into software
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, everybody. Hope you guys are awesome I am
 heading home from the office today and there's actually a really cool mastermind group that I'm part of that meets once a year and
 They haven't I bet in like almost two years now because the whole COVID thing and they're meeting right now
 And I'm not able to be there and just breaking my heart
 But I got a message from my friend Allison Prince who is there and she said you've been being quoted like three or four times
 I said what do people say to me my ears are burning tell me tell him and she said
 That someone quoted and she read the quote which was
 basically
 Something I said last year at the event which is whatever you're good at is turn that into software and
 I want to give you context because this group is some of the best personal development
 Gurus in the world literally the who's who you would know
 Probably 95% of their names
 And most of them have courses. They got products. They got podcasts. They got YouTube channels
 They got all these things with their teaching their stuff and all of them have bigger reach bigger following bigger lists bigger everything than I do but
 The reality is I think for the most part I make more money than almost all not all and there's a couple of litter
 It's a couple I'm gaining on but as a whole
 Pretty substantially I make more money than most of them and when they're talking about last time
 I was like you guys are all brilliant like you have these ideas you have these things but you're selling it
 Of course and of course is good
 But man if you could turn that course into into software it would change everything and like oh that doesn't work for me
 And I was like yes
 I have to understand like my art like their artists personal development right my art was
 Is not was my heart is building funnels and so for years I did courses teaching how to build funnels and how to lay
 Amount how to write copy and how do those things but it wasn't true until we turned our knowledge into software
 That my businesses went from good to like insane right?
 Anything about funnel scripts right we taught people how to write copy for decades and nobody wants to buy copywriting
 So we turned it into software and boom funnel scripts is a you know to come look up ex award winner
 Funnels talked about building funnels and how to do it in the strategy
 But it wasn't wasn't until we turned it into software that blew up
 I've watched Garrett white recently Garrett white
 If you know he did live events where men came out to wake up warrior and he would take another beach
 And he beat him up and he would make him tough and turn him into men and it's amazing right
 He did that for five or six years doing events every single month and then now he's stopped those he shut him down and
 Now he's turning what he does in software. We log in software. You do the thing you read the thing
 You read the message you listen to the app you check the thing off and you're doing the things and it's transitioning it from
 information to
 information blended into software and so for you guys I want you to think about that because
 In fact when I one of my very first mentors a lot of you know
 This is Dan Kennedy and Bill Glazer were my my first two big mentors and in their company magnetic marketing
 They have a newsletter where they sell access to the month and newsletter, right?
 And one of the things that that bill used to always talk to me about is like you have to have any kind of continuity
 You got to build in pain and disconnect meaning it's hard for somebody to leave
 Right and he said the biggest problem that in their business was there is no pain and disconnect people were buying the newsletter
 Which was great and there's great recurring recurring income stream
 But if something happened right their credit card failed there some bills happen their business
 You know whatever first thing to go is info right? Oh, I got like this has been helpful
 But I don't have to have this membership. I don't have to have this
 This newsletter I don't have to have these things if I don't you know for whatever reason
 So they will the cancel them really quickly very easily because there's no pain of disconnect
 Where does the click funnel right now when someone gets an account to click fun?
 Except their site except their funnel instead of their you know things are happening in their thing they have their email list
 And they've got things happening, you know
 If things shift needs get hard things happen the last thing they're gonna cut is
 Click funnels because the pain of disconnect is so high they could they stop paying their bill to click funnels their business falls apart, right?
 I remember in the continuity business when we're doing membership sites and stuff people go three or four or five months
 Stop paying would be hounding him trying to get into paying things like that
 Where's click phones is opposite right some stops paying sites go down and within five minutes. They're calling us like
 Oh, here's my credit card like let me update it right
 It just shifts the thing because the pain of disconnect is so high and so the problem traditionally with information products or coaching or things
 Like that is that there's no pain of disconnect right people have it they can cancel it and it's it's simple to do because
 There's no pain disconnect, but as soon as you take your
 Your course right and you turn it into software now someone's logging in they're going in they're filling out things are taking notes
 They've got things they're building up like now all these things are there they're stored in the spot if they were to cancel
 They lose all this information right and so how do you turn your hey turn your knowledge the things you're good at into software?
 I just want you guys thinking about that we've done it a couple times this year
 One of them recently and the site's not live yet
 It made me live by times to me is here this but if you go to brain dump calm
 You know we have a process that we use to brain dump and get the ideas out of our head and we taught it to people
 I showed them how to use it in Trello
 I showed people how to do it in different ways and doing Google Docs and like this how we bring up our ideas to write a book or
 Create a course to do different things like that and it was good
 You know some people paid for some you know most people wouldn't because it's like how am I going to pay you to show me
 How to bring up my ideas and so we took this idea this skill set this knowledge
 We have we turned in software and software now allows you to brain dump stuff and what's cool about it
 Number one it makes the process so much simpler so much easier
 I can just give it to people they can do it very fast very easily, which is exciting number one
 But number two is now is a pain disconnect if you spent a week or a month or you're brain dumping your ideas into our software
 You don't want to cancel because if you do you lose all the stuff you've brain dump right you lose all your notes your ideas
 You're like all that stuff disappears with you and so the pain disconnect is very very high
 Whereas if you bought a training course, you know
 Let's say you're paying 30 bucks a month to go through my course and how to bring them your ideas like after
 Month number one like I get the gist right I already listened to it or I don't need anymore
 Whatever it's easy to cancel where's the software now?
 You're part of it. You're probably gonna use it for forever, right?
 And so just what you thinking through those things right?
 How do you take what you know and turn into software when you do that you're gonna increase your valuations your company will be worth more
 You'll increase your stick rates your your stick will be longer you'll increase
 Happiness people feel like you know the increase personally value like software feels more expensive than courses and about a million other things
 So anyway, I thought it was cool because they quoted me today during the master my meeting
 and I wanted to share the quote with you guys since I'm not able to hang out with all my friends who were super cool and
 literally like these people that are changing the world and I can't be there with them which is
 too bad, but
 At least I'm doing something cool here as well. So anyway, I don't want to complain about not being there
 I stood back for a very important and very very cool reason so no stress, but hopefully that helps you guys
 With that said I'm home. I'm gonna play with my kids, which is the number one reason why I wasn't able to go
 and we go have some fun with them so I appreciate you guys thanks so much for listening and
 Go figure out how to turn your ideas into actual software. Thanks so much everybody. I'll talk soon
