 Hey, good morning everybody this is Freshfall and I'm welcome you back to the marketing secrets podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Everyone is crazy rainy day out here our weather here in Boise is raining it wants to snow
 We're in close to Christmas, but it's like just too warm. It's been raining like crazy. We're praying. It's cold
 So we can get some snow
 Cuz I'd be really fun right now, but anyway, I'm heading to the office and just had a recurring theme in my head
 The last day or so that was like I need to I need to share this to everybody so I'm gonna talk about it first my own experience and then
 close friends experience and then
 Some of it you guys are gonna be related back to you. So the theme the message today is you got to keep on putting fuel into the fire
 Now I've experienced this through four times throughout my career. I made this mistake and learned from it
 Now hopefully I won't make this mistake again, but
 A lot of times it happens is we start having success with something right and starts working right?
 This is amazing and then you stop doing it for some reason right so in our business for example like we'll start growing a list
 We're doing doing something right to get new customers and people in our dorm or having fun with it
 It's working also we start building the list and we start we shift our focus from that like selling them stuff and doing things
 All these things and we forget about the fuel that was that was bringing people in to our to our business and then
 And at first you don't notice it because you're having so much success with existing customers you brought in
 But eventually it starts imploding and your company will eventually die
 I've seen so many people who look they get into my world
 They hear me talk about like you need to do a podcast a week every single week for least a year
 And so they do they do it for like for like a month and a month and a half and they start making some sales
 And I said so excited and they stop doing the webinar because like we're making money things are great
 Let's cut off the fuel this building our company
 That's what happens and they logically like I would never do that, but how many of you guys are still doing your weekly webinars?
 All right, that means you cut off the fuel to your your business
 All right, so let me step back like a decade ago when I was building my company and I remember
 I remember one point for sure like I was having some success with making some money things were working and
 I was like this is amazing
 It's an amazing start having company start building team had a bunch of people had an office and then I had this idea for this
 This website that was gonna be like the greatest thing in the world to start working on it
 And took us about six months to build that website
 I remember during the process
 I was like, okay, I don't want to like email my list other things that I want to like
 You know
 I don't want to like make them upset
 I don't want to like freak them out because I want them to be ready
 So when I had this thing to launch the live look great to buy it
 So if like six months I'd email my list and then the new thing came out
 I was so excited and we emailed the list the list and normally would get you know three or four thousand clicks if I send an email to him
 I remember I have like 300 opens and like 12 clicks and I was like oh crap
 If they remember who I am like I'm screwed like I
 I mean such a bad spot right now because I need money very very badly
 Which is reason why I did this whole promotion and and they forgot who I was I hadn't been putting fuel into the fire and
 And it was very sad scary lesson right on fire
 Much people had a layoff staff and then I just scramble to rebuild my list rebuild connection with them
 Get new people I remember in my head saying okay
 I will never not email my list because people forget so fast like if I waited a week
 Email my list of it takes me three weeks to be my list like two thirds my list will forgotten who I am by that point
 There's so much noise so much things happening like you have to always be out there
 That's reason why I'm doing Instagrams every day and Facebook's every day and podcasts every day and all these things every single
 They can't keep fueling the fire fueling the fires what builds the the Empire Kim and so
 I had a friend over last night
 We're talking and and he's going to be a tough time now and we start talking and it was funny because
 He's a couple different
 businesses and and all of them he had stopped putting the fuel for his local business
 He'd stopped the fuel and he just restarted it and he was like this killing it
 We're doing an awesome again. I'm like yeah, but what's the lesson?
 He's like I forgot to put fuel in the fire
 I'm like yeah
 You gotta keep doing that like even when things get successful
 You gotta keep doing the things are bringing fuel in the fire and that same person has a webinar
 And he was doing the weekly webinar for a long time making much money
 And then he stopped because he started selling other events and things like that to this list and it worked for a while
 And then attrition started happening and atrophy you're everyone call it and then and then it slowed down
 I said start doing the weekly webinar I get back that that's the fuel that builds the business that keeps doing
 it
 Sam Brennan as a podcast and he's like I used to podcast a couple times a week and I have a podcast since June
 It's like you got to keep fuel in the fire. You keep fuel in the fire even if success over here. You can't stop fueling the fire
 And so that's just kind of a message for you guys today. This is a very short one
 I know
 Partially because fun Friday starts in like five minutes. I got to run in there and get it all set up
 That's a little late
 But I just wanted you guys to think through that because you guys are gonna go through these cycles of like you're focusing on like
 How do I make it rain? How do I feel the fire? How do I bring people in you're doing that?
 You're doing that you're doing that and also in your list and your customer base will start growing and then what's gonna happen?
 It's I'm warning you folks who haven't yet and I'm reminding you folks who have you're gonna shift your focus
 And you should you should be shifting some portion of your focus to that audience and serving them and like what's next
 They need how it's can I like what can I do is an event is whatever?
 But the big thing is like you can't stop you still have to like tie in like I have to keep fuel in the fire
 I keep feeling the fire
 Okay, and in our company like we now have John Parks on my team who literally its entire job is to keep adding fuel to the fire right like
 He runs the traffic side things
 He's always doing things then for me and my content like I keep creating podcasts
 I got at least two podcasts a week
 I got to do at least and this many emails we're gonna do we have these like metrics
 We have to keep doing you know with to keep running the webinars
 He's at least a thousand people weeks register for the webinar way to keep doing this
 We just have like these numbers that we just keep doing because we know that's with fuel for the business
 I could easily stop right now. I could stop doing all the stuff
 I could be like why are you still on Instagram? Why are you still on Facebook?
 Why I could stop all the things right?
 But I know what would happen in six months or year for now if I stop those things today
 Okay, I can tell you how many friends I have who've been this industry is longer longer than me who were killing it one time
 They built the best huge following of people and then they stopped and they kept messages following the problem with that
 It's like it's always either constantly growing or shrinking right?
 And so if you stop bringing new fuel in the fire new people in the front end
 That your existing list while they might be hot and responsive now
 you'll continue to
 To get worse and worse and worse eventually you're out of business and so
 This is this is the the warning to you all
 Continually put fuel on the fire
 You know initially show your business is gonna be 100% of your effort because you have no fuel
 You have no people you have nothing to sell you know
 No one to sell to you so it's like focusing focusing focusing hundreds of the time and it's customer start coming
 You start shrinking and shrinking it, but I would say man. I would I would spend like
 At least 50% of all your time on like fueling the fire and the other 50% on like serving the people you have in there
 But I wouldn't drop below that because if you do it will start to shrink and shrink and eventually disappear
 Which is the worst thing for all of us. So all right. There's your word of warning
 Fuel your fire keep it going do not stop even when it seems like I don't need to do this anymore because I got this big following
 People love me look at me and say round Russell's got over a million people between all the platforms
 I think got a million and a half on email list we got
 700,000 on Facebook 200,000 Instagram, you know always went to places and you keep fuel in the fire
 Keep fuel in the fire because I know I would become irrelevant if I stop alright guys be a message from L. He's saying
 Where are you from for I starts in two minutes? I gotta go appreciate you all don't forget to fuel your fire continually consistently
