 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing secrets podcast. I got something cool to share with you today
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everyone, all right, so first off I
 Want to share something that's a little different than normal. We've been promoting fun-lacking live
 We're getting close to selling on tickets
 So I thought it'd be fun to do Facebook lives with all different speakers and so
 Today I did two Facebook lives one was with Alex and Layla Harmose and then Myron Golden who are like amazing people
 and it's an I did on with with Kayla Poland and also with Natalie Hodson and
 It's been really fun to talk to the speakers and get them excited
 but what they're talking about and everyone else excited as well and
 During one of the Facebook lives today
 We had a really cool thing kind of came out of it. So it's Alex from old. Some of you guys may know Alex
 Because he's spoken. This is a second fun. I'm like you I've spoken at him. It's why I forgive me speaking of this one
 But what's interesting is at the end of it
 I was asking I asked like you know why why do you think people should come flying alive and he was just like
 He said, you know, I think it's like three or four years ago. He went to an event
 It wasn't my event it was it was a it was trafficking conversion action around Isis event and he was at the event
 And I had a chance I was speaking the event and he told me the story later
 So I'm kind of feeling the back story. He didn't talk to us today
 But feeling in some of the back story for you guys so it makes sense at this event
 I had an hour to speak and they wouldn't let me pitch anything which is like painful for me as someone who loves to sell things
 Because I feel like selling is how we actually change people's lives and so I get on stage
 And I do my my tire funnel
 X presentation that I get to like where I transitioned to my clothes and I'm like well
 That's all I got see you guys and I had an end and but I didn't know the time was Alex is sitting out there in the audience and Alex at the time
 had one or two gyms and
 He was doing a ripen out like not loving it and you and he told me I was sitting in the audience and he was just like
 I want to do that whatever he just talked about I want to do that
 But I didn't sell anything so we couldn't buy anything and said that kind of just you know
 It ended it then happens and he went back home and he says I can't remember exactly
 You know six months a year later something like that he was sitting there and he was at a time when he was just not
 Super-excitable what he was doing and he was like that dude. I heard speak at T&C
 What's his name again like Russell Brunson and he didn't know he never bought any of my products and my services
 He just
 Google like Russell Brunson
 Coaching or something like maybe I can hire him to be a coach or something
 I don't know so he Google that and he found my inner circle page applied for her circle
 Signed up for it and and it's funny because I'm my very first call and on the first call
 He's got two or three gyms and and Alex if you talk and super charismatic like dudes done like 5,000 one-on-one
 Face-to-face sales in his lifetime. He's just a great sales person
 But I'm doing this this call of them when people join the inner circle
 I do it I call it a decade in a day
 So I try to cram a decade in my life into a day with them
 And I want to like shortcut their success and so I have like an hour long call with him
 And so I'm doing this call and he tells me on the call
 He's like you know my goal was if I can make I can actually if I make 20 grand a month online like that would that would
 dramatically change my life and I
 Gotta start like I feel bad but I started laughing at him and he's like what I'm like do 20 grand a month
 Like you have like I can like just hearing him talk
 I was like you have so like your you're like your skill is so high and I was like you're just like you're in like a level
 Two or three opportunity with like a level 10 skills like we just shift some things like like 20 kind of I go
 Okay, we'll try to do that like tomorrow and then let's like increase from there and it was fun because on
 on today's on today's
 Fun or Facebook live you're talking about business right now. They're doing as like a million and a half a month recurring office business
 They launched eight months ago like it's crazy
 They're trying to hit the the eight figure club before for liking lives
 So basically means they made a ten million dollars in like seven and a half eight months
 And it's interesting and so I should because first off it's inspiring
 second off
 It's always fun to tease Alex about his huge goals. He had initially but most importantly I want to show us for you guys because how many times
 Do we go and we do things then the outside don't seem fruitful right like?
 Like I spoke at T&C. I spoke in front of these people I shared my message
 I didn't get something it ended and it's like you leave and like I don't know
 That helped how many times you do a Facebook live and you like you know 30 people that see it or you do a YouTube video
 You get like 120 people to watch it and you look at those things
 Sometimes we look at those stats and we you know we see the other videos like a million views and things like that
 We see ours like oh only 120 people saw that like man what a waste of time
 I shouldn't have been doing that I should have been focusing on something else
 but we don't realize is that that was 120 people that heard your message and
 Who knows who those people are like one of them could have been the Alex Hermosey
 Who was sitting in the audience he heard your message it resonated with him didn't do anything and then a year later
 Like in a time when he's probably not happy not like completely fulfilled is like what was that that dude again?
 What's his name? They start googling you and they find you and then fast forward a little bit
 They're doing ten million dollars in sales right like think about your business like how many times you do a Facebook live
 And you feel bum because you didn't reach enough people but like those little numbers like one person two people 20 50 100 like those are people
 Like if I like I'm in my inner circle room. I know like this holds I think about 75 seats for those who have seen the video verse 75 seats
 That's 75 people right when I know my inner circle 75 people here like
 75 people like is the like that's a lot of people right like and if and everyone for me that in this room paid 25 grand to be there
 I did it's a lot of money right as well, but it's 75 people and if I'm sharing my message in this group
 I'm not depressed. I'm like only 75 people hurt
 I'm like 75 people hurt each these people are gonna go and they're gonna transform the world with it because it's like so cool
 And so I don't want you to get discouraged when you do a video or Facebook live or podcast and only a hundred people heard it
 Realize that like you're planning seed
 You're doing these things out there and you never know who's gonna who's gonna hear and resonate with it
 And it might not be immediately but like Alex a year later
 Because something I said a year at an event and I didn't meet him there
 I didn't bump in new my just I did my thing and I left I didn't know if it helped and a year later
 It's it was the seed that we planted that got him to
 To Google the name make the phone call get in the program and
 Not only make you know this money for him. I look at my people's lives
 He's affecting and so I just wanted to show it because it was just it was for me
 Like that one of those round robin things where came back to the beginning and just like that is cool
 I'm so glad I went to TNC and I spoke and didn't sell anything to make any money like something
 It seemed like kind of a waste of time afterwards. I'm so glad I did it. So I mean similar happened
 Last year went to affiliate summit. In fact, I did I feel bad. I did a podcast talking about how like
 Their business model was the worst business model. I've ever ever seen I still kind of stand behind that
 But I feel kind of bad about right
 Because anyway, you can rewind that podcast listen to but what's interesting is
 I don't usually go to speak in events unless there's like a minimum of at the Alice people in the room
 Or else it's just not worth time like next week we're speaking or next month or speaking at Grand Carne
 Which is what's have like 8500 people out of like for me that just by my time
 I get it's it's tough right, but I feel it's someone was one of the first events everyone to start
 I want to go and speak and I give this event and they have like guards at the door and like the attendees have to pay extra to
 Actually come into your room
 So I'm doing my keynote speech in this room and there's like 15 people and I'm like are you kidding me?
 I spent all this my like the time and the money like
 like
 Someone asked for one one consulting today
 I quoted a 250 grand a day because that's like what it would take for me to actually break away a day from my office to be
 able to do it
 So it's like I spent the travel time there the time there and the time back like if I was to build that out
 Working it, you know half million dollars or more to do that and I'm sitting in room 15 people and I was just like angry
 So I'm like dude like are you serious 15 people?
 And so I shared my message and then it got done and
 You know once you came and shook my hand and then I left when I had to eat with my team
 That was there and then flew home kind of like annoyed that I wasted my time at this event
 But what I didn't realize was sitting in that event was someone who's becoming dear friend
 Her name is Allison Prince and Allison's at this event
 She's like and I didn't notice till like two weeks later. She calls her office and she's like I was an affiliate summit
 I heard Russell speak he was the only speaker on stage who wasn't drunk
 and she's like I resonate with that someone who doesn't drink and because of that I want to join the coaching program and
 This was literally two days before the very first fathom and we ever did and and
 Derek's on the phone like okay
 I think he she has three but three multi million dollar businesses
 So she's like killing it, but she wanted to learn like this this side of business. We did funnels and stuff and so
 She she she signed up and she jumped in her car and drove here and showed up the morning of the event
 I was like I don't know who you like I knew everyone else who was coming because we had somebody in a circle
 Members like I don't know who you are. She's like I just joined yesterday
 She say I was a fillet summer last week you were the only speaker wasn't drunk and so that's why I'm here now and I was like
 whoa like and
 Then and then last night I'm gonna follow my phone here with me dang it last night she messaged me and
 It's been eight months nine no ten
 Ten ten half eleven something like that. Yeah, cuz it's February as she came so and now we're in January
 So spend 11 months and she messes me yesterday. She said guess what Russell? I said what she said
 I just sold my thousandth course and she sold her course for $1000 made me a million dollars
 She said this is the fastest I've ever gone from zero to a million dollars in any of my companies ever
 She's like I just enjoy I just joined the two comic clubs
 She's freaking out by the way Allison speaking up on liking live
 and
 And I heard that and I was just thinking I'm like man
 So grateful I went to fillet summit because if I wouldn't have
 Allison one of those 15 people who was sitting in the room wouldn't have heard my message
 She went I came and I look at the live she's transforming out because of it so
 I just want to show it to you
 I don't know where to go with that other than keep doing what you're doing even feels like it's not making impact at the time
 I mean if like I'm in a fit like 15 people saw that video that presentation I gave right 15 people saw it
 But Allison saw it and because of that it's transformed her life and it's transformed a thousand of her customers life
 So now I'm just gonna continue that moving forward and she's speaking for a lucky life
 So those years for coming she's gonna have chance transform your life as well
 Alex and Layla are gonna be there. It's gonna like they're gonna transform your life like it's just it's just really cool things
 Don't get bummed out if nobody seems like they're listening right now. It doesn't matter. You're sewing seeds
 You're doing what you love you're you're putting your message out there and I just keep doing it
 Do it with faith knowing that if you plan enough seeds the right people will come back
 Your sheep will hear your voice and they will come to you like that's that's a scriptural doctrinal principle that Christ taught
 it's the same thing for you like put your message out there and
 Your sheep will hear your voice and they will come to you and they know that impact on them that that you can have and that's what's so exciting
 So don't stop keep publishing keep putting it out there even if those like those like no one's listening because you never know who is actually listening
 So that said we're gonna back in we're about to launch a funnel. I gotta go
 I just thought the lights look cool on the video and want to share that with you guys
 So appreciate you all an amazing day and we'll talk to you soon. Bye
