 What's up everyone? This is Russell. Welcome back to part two of the special J Abraham interview series
 I hope you enjoyed the first episode. It was really fun to have J ask me a whole bunch of cool questions and hopefully you got some value from the conversations
 In this next episode, I'm gonna release the second part of this interview another 20 or so minutes long and this one
 We start talking about
 Internal company culture versus customer culture, which is something that I've been really good at one of these and I struggled the other one
 And the things I'm learning we talk about two comic-level awards and how how we use that to build a community and to build an amazing culture
 We talk about bringing customers on as employees talked about
 Having ambition going after multiple big businesses and how I believe entrepreneurs are called to serve
 Talk about acquisitions and building funnels to talk about
 The three things that determine success in any offer which you guys know that you've been around my world for a long time
 It's hook story offer we go deep and hook story offer we talk about a whole bunch of other cool things
 So again this next it seems saying this interview this next part is only 21 minutes long or something
 And how much stuff we covered is there's a lot in theirs. Hopefully you get a lot of value from this episode
 It's so let us know and I'll see you guys afterwards
 For part three on the next episode
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 I'm one gradient away from talking about
 Dot-com secrets, but I want to hit it on one more thing
 Let's talk about culture because I think you must have a great culture in your organization to keep growing at that rate and also
 let's talk about
 Creative collaboration because it works many ways it can be affiliate joint venture. It can be sharing knowledge
 expertise take those
 Macro thoughts and run with them any way you want yeah
 So great culture is important. I think in two sides. There's the internal company culture
 but it's also the culture of the the customers and
 Both of those are they're different, but they're very very powerful
 So if you look at click funnels one of the most powerful things we did was not just creating a software platform
 But I wanted to create a movement. I wanted like if you look at our people they call themselves funnel hackers
 They all wear t-shirts they funnel hackers they people who tattoo it to themselves
 Like they're part of something bigger than just oh I use the software when you use someone's software
 It's a software changes the one gets better
 They'll jump in you know they'll jump around but when they're part of something bigger
 They're part of a culture they stick for forever and so for me and I wrote about this my my expert seekers book
 I wrote a whole chapter about how do you create a movement that gets people connected where they don't leave you and
 There are a lot of different a lot of ways to do that one of the most powerful
 I don't know if you hasn't seen these before but we we launched an award inside of our company called the two
 Comic Club award and there's two comments close two commas and a million dollars
 So anytime so it makes a million dollars inside of a funnel
 They get this big huge thing. It's a record gold record with commas on it and they come to our events
 They come on stage they get recognized and all these things are happening and for people like when they first start seeing that
 That's their gold that's their mission. That's what they want to do. I think it was Napoleon Bonaparte said that
 That it's amazing what a man will do for a scrap of ribbon right like it's the same thing like all this want to be rewarded
 And I think in every business now that's something that people can do so we did it with entrepreneurs
 They just became the the awards show for entrepreneurs
 But now we've seen people inside of our in some of our community who modeled this for their community
 So there's people who are musicians who are using
 Funnels to grow their companies and they have awards for musicians like you get your first 10,000 songs downloaded you get this award
 You get a million songs down and you get this award and now their customers are all fighting
 Internally for these awards in this recognition because they they want to be part of this thing, right?
 And so that's a that's been a big part of creating that that culture
 And so there's that side and there's also the company culture
 but one thing we found that's been super helpful with company culture is a
 Lot of our hiring also comes from within our community
 So there are people who are already using the platform who already believe in the mission. They already, you know
 They they they love what we're doing anyway
 But for some reason they're not they're not able to launch their own business
 They haven't had success with it like you look at you know our support teams probably 200 people most of those people are
 Are people who use the platform first? They were customers. They loved it loved the idea
 They love building funnels, but they never figured out like how to have success for their own business yet, right?
 And so instead they said you know we
 When we put applications like hey if you love click funnels, you'll be part of this you can you can join it
 And now that I have a chance to work in this company that I'm I wanted to use anyway
 They're doing the stuff I can hang out with the customers
 I love and so it's build this really cool internal culture as well people who are already bought into our mission
 What we're trying to do and trying to accomplish and so there's both those sides of the culture that are I think are so
 Powerful and so important that keeps people around we don't have many employees that leave the turnovers really small
 It's because they're part of this thing
 They would be they'd be paying for it anyway because they already that passionate about it
 And now we let them come in and they can work for us
 They can be paid to be part of it and interacts our customers and and it's it's
 And it changes changes the whole dynamics of your business
 We're great points and thank you because I'm taking you into probably realms that I hope everyone doesn't ask you to talk about because I think
 they're probably resides in you a lot of
 Of profound knowledge to share and I think it's very valuable because you're a catalyst for others to to basically be a like a lighthouse
 Or a beacon of how they can go from wherever they are to a better place
 So you also have three or four concurrent businesses you got click funnels doing 200 million
 You got your your digital secrets or is it called digital secrets comm secrets pardon me pardon me
 You got your you got your supplement business. How do you do all that out of somebody go from
 Glit in the eye when they're 14
 Shoot, you know selling kids to make
 But by the way a potato gun is not a real gun everybody because guns are outlawed and there's just it's a fun thing
 The kids do they stick a potato in a
 In a minute it's a fun thing that a lot of kids my kids had them and they're just fun
 But how do you go from that kind of a
 Innocence and and sort of theoretical
 Ambition to growth to multiple business growth to and you seem happy and always when I talk to you
 Calm and controlled that might be a facade you might actually be a neuro
 Nightmare but you seem to be in control of your yourself and your whole world
 Which is and you've got plenty of time that you spend with your children
 I'm always trying to
 To pitch him on something and he's always taking his kids to wrestling or
 Are always doing things that give him quality of life, which is really interesting
 Given the diversity of activities involved in again. I'm throwing you. This is like
 Actual rorschach for entrepreneurs so you can answer any way or you can decide you want to move on to the next question. I don't care
 No, I actually love this question. So
 Um a couple of things and I think it's just hopefully this is like everyone gets this
 This is the point that I don't think most entrepreneurs and business people think about
 Most business owners thinking of their business as like what is the product they sell right like I sell an iphone or I sell funnels
 For me like that's not how I look at my world at all
 I look at who are the people like what is the group of people that I've been called to serve
 And so in my mind the people I've been called to serve are entrepreneurs like those are the people who I jive with
 I'm passionate about them. They help other people. It like fulfills me
 And so that's that's what I'm called to serve now. It doesn't mean I have to serve them only through funnels
 I can serve them through any way possible and so um for me it started with
 Um, you know, I started trying a lot of different things initially, but eventually
 Clickfunnels was the software platform that made that made this grow for me
 Like that's when it started blowing up was that but then I was like, okay
 Well
 They had the software platform, but I want to educate them too because these are my people I'm called to serve like the more simple
 I can make their lives the more money I'm gonna make so how to make the life simpler and start my very first book
 Which was called dot com secrets it was all about teaching them like we give you this platform
 But you have to understand the strategy behind us the dot com secrets is the book that teaches the strategy on how to use funnels to grow your business
 And so that was the first book and then two years later. I was like people are using funnels
 They understand the strategy, but they're not good at telling their stories and like
 Creating customers we're gonna buy from over and over and over again
 How can I make this simpler for them?
 And so that's when I was like, oh, I should read another book that my second book was called expert secrets
 Which taught them now here's how to use your expertise and your knowledge and your information and your stories
 To move people through your funnels and get them to buy from you and buy from you again
 And then it was like, hey, well, how do we you know?
 What's next problem?
 The next problem was that people weren't getting traffic to their funnels, right?
 They couldn't get people profitably to come to them and so that was my third book was traffic secrets came and help write a book
 That's gonna help them get traffic that became the third thing
 And so a lot of this just came for that like supplements like the supplements we have right now are for entrepreneurs to help them have more energy
 More passionate and be able to to do what we do as entrepreneurs
 And so everything is it's kind of focused around helping them. So that's number one
 The second thing is that I realized that the business that I'm really in is
 Is is an acquisition business, right? Like I learned this from you initially
 There's three ways to grow business, right?
 Like how do you acquire more customers get them to spend more and buy more often, right?
 So it's like like I'm in this company where I got to acquire new customers
 And so how do I acquire customers? So I create funnels on the front end to acquire them
 And so one thing that's kind of unique about us is we bootstrapped our company
 We didn't take on any outside funding and so all of our all of our customers had to be had to be created profitably
 And so for us we did that through these book funnels each time we have we want to book
 It costs us about 20 to 30 dollars to sell a book but through the funnel
 I make 50 or 60 dollars
 So I'm I'm usually profitable on every single book we sell
 And so when someone comes in they buy a book we probably acquire that customer
 And then we can sell and click funnels and doesn't cost any new money
 It's it's you know, it's basically anything that happens after the book funnel is all pure profit
 And so that became our business
 And so what I said is that I like I have to have a team that's really really good at making funnels like the best funnel team in the world
 And so that became the side of the business that I run
 I have a partner that runs on the software side and I run the acquisition side
 I had to be able to create funnels that acquire customers profitably and so I have this team now
 It's amazing. So I'm like, okay. Here's the book I wrote make a funnel
 Here's the supplement make a funnel. Here's that and so we have the processes and the tools in place where we can create anything and do a funnel
 As you know
 Last year
 Dan Kennedy came to us and we had an opportunity to buy his company
 I was like well his customers are entrepreneurs his customers need funnels
 Let's just we acquired his company, you know 40 years of his intellectual property
 And I have a whole team now making taking all his own intellectual property and turn him into these funnels that were popping out
 And you know, Dan's company has grown more in the last you know four months and it did the last
 12 years combined and it's just because we have all the systems and things in place to be able to do that and so
 Um, and it's been fun
 It's you know, my favorite thing is funnels and we have a team that just builds funnels based on any crazy idea that I want to plug in there
 We we build out the funnels and it gets entrepreneurs to raise their hands give us money
 And then we can then from there get them into click funnels
 But it all comes down to really understand who's your dream customer and like we're all the different ways you can serve them
 I love that. So now let's take let's take the gloves off and talk about
 uh about
 Online what you what you know that most people don't but don't reach anything that you charge a lot of money for
 But share two things first of all since you are the king of funnels
 And you get to examine the most high performing funnels
 And most people don't do funnels and i'll tell you even though we have your service
 I don't I don't do funnels anymore embarrassing. It's just not what I want to do is embarrassing and stupidly
 But why don't you tell tell everyone here? What have you what are some of the i'll call it a denominator that the the higher performing
 Success factors in creating funnels
 And i'm going to add I always ask multiple things that I ask multiple things so you can choose
 To answer one any combination or say those are great questions jay
 But I want to answer a different question
 I don't care because I just want to plumb what you know that I don't and they don't and i'm their advocate
 But you can talk about what you learned about funnels you can talk about
 uh
 About a digital marketing lead generating a traffic building conversion that
 Most people don't know and realize they're probably by and large
 Behind what what you might be teaching to everyone but it would be very helpful because everybody wants the advantage
 And then finally you you launched it in the beginning through very non-linear approaches
 And it's it requires you to think differently and i'm a great
 advocate of thinking totally differently than everybody else and
 Doing things totally different so you can talk about any any combination or none of the above
 You know, uh, the ball is thrown to you
 Awesome
 Yeah, I have some I think we're cool to share with you guys and it's something that's
 On the outside i'm going to explain it in your argument. That's really simple, but it's the key to everything in fact
 Um, I have people who will hire me and you know
 They have a campaign advertising campaign and they're looking at their ad and their funnel everything and they want to pay me
 You know quarter million dollars to review their funnel and for a while i it's like, I don't know
 Like I didn't have a process for this and then after doing it four or five times
 I was like this is actually a really really simple process
 And i'm going to teach you as a process because then you don't have to give me quarter million dollars
 You can just do it yourself
 But if you want to y'all take it to you, but i'm interested in but um, it's interesting because
 um
 There's three core things that happen at every single step and if a step in your digital funnel is not working
 It's always one of these three things so i'll explain three things first and i'll walk you through you can't help work
 So every single step in your process from the ad to the landing page to the sales page the upsell the downsell the email sequence
 The recharging every single thing they all have three components
 They have a hook they have a story and they have an offer so hooks story offer and when something's not working
 It's always one of those three things and so what happens when we come bring their funnel in their campaign
 Here's our advertising campaign. What's not working and i'll look at the ad first i'm like, okay
 What's either the hook the story or the offer look at the ad like what is it like is it grabbing you as a hook there
 you know so um
 And if the ad's working good, but then the landing page is not like well
 The landing page is either the hook the story or the offer
 If the ad's working landing page working with the sales page is not where it's like well
 It's either the hook story or the offer so i want to break those things down
 So the hook the hook is the thing that's going to grab someone's attention
 Right and it could be anything it could be it could be your face it could be your hands
 It could be the copy it could be the words it could be the background like
 Everything we have in our power is a hook. So for example
 I always think about people are there on their phone and they're sitting back and they're on Facebook or youtube or whatever
 They're sitting here scrolling
 You know they're bored out of mind scrolling and our hook is something that's going to grab them and stop them from scrolling for just a second
 Right and in the hook the only job hook is to grab their attention just for long enough
 Then we can tell them our story. Okay, so then we have a chance they stop scrolling now
 We can tell the story and depending on you know if it's if it's an ad the story might be 15 seconds if it's a landing page
 Maybe it's maybe it's five minutes if it's a sales video or a webinar it can be an hour or two
 But the second step is the story now the goal of the story
 Is to increase the perceived value of the offer that you're going to make
 Okay, and so it's not just a story for story's sake
 But the goal of the story is to increase the perceived value of
 Of the the offer you're about to make
 And number three is the actual offer how to make a really good offer and so a good example that's actually with my phone
 Um, you know these phones, I think I don't know how much iPhones cost five or six hundred dollars
 But I wanted to demonstrate the power of a really good story at this event
 I went to so what's this event and there's probably two thousand men in the audience was it was a it was a
 It's called warrior week and there's two thousand men in this in this audience
 And I brought my phone and said who here would give me
 Six hundred dollars for this phone and nobody's hands went up. You know, maybe one person's like, I'll give you six hundred
 Dollars. That's the value of it. I said, okay, um, I'm like in
 10 minutes from now. I'm gonna tell you guys a story about this phone and I bet you I get you at least one of you guys
 To be willing to give me a hundred thousand dollars to this phone and everyone's like, no, there's no way
 I said, okay. Let me tell you stories. So this is my cell phone
 I've been carrying with me for the last year however many years and it looks like a phone just like to everybody else
 But I want to tell you what's on this phone. It's an on this phone
 There's a whole bunch of really cool things I start telling this story about the people in my role index
 I said jay rams his phone numbers in here and tony robins his phone numbers in here as well as this person
 I start listing up all the people and like you'd have their like their contact information
 And then we went to my um to my iBooks app and I showed I said every single course
 I've ever bought over the last 20 years after I buy the course I make a digital version
 I put it on my phone and I start scrolling through here
 I said this is about 1.5 million dollars worth of marketing and sales courses every marketing sales
 Persuasion personal velvet course from the beginning time now I purchased it and they're all on my phone
 I mean, I can listen fact I got I probably got a dozen of jay's programs right here. I can show you guys literally they're all on here
 Every time he's ever spoken it's end up on my phone
 And that's not going through the other things I show I went thing after thing and all of a sudden the value of this phone
 I told the store about phone the perceived value of got higher and higher and higher
 And after I told this story went through all the things are on this phone
 Um, then I sat down. I said, okay, let's do an auction for my phone
 I'm a who are you gonna get me a thousand dollars and everyone's hands went up who are you gonna be 5,000 10 20 25 30 50
 I got to a hundred thousand dollars the hundred fifty thousand in your hands are starting to drop
 I got to five hundred thousand dollars and there were so three people's hands who were who were in the air
 I said you guys are dead seriously we 500,000 right now my phone
 I said yeah, we were I said okay, prove it come on stage
 And so three people came up on stage and they were willing to give me half a million dollars for my phone
 And I said
 I said like why would like two minutes ago you wouldn't give me a thousand dollars for this
 Why would you give me five hundred thousand dollars?
 And one of the guys grabbed at my microphone he said man after knowing what's on that phone that seems like a super good deal
 Right, and that's the power of a really good story
 So again, we got to grab the hook
 We had to tell him a story to increase the perceived value of the thing we're going to sell them
 And then we got to make them a really good at offer
 And that happens again on every single page so it happens on the ad the landing page the sales page the upsells the downsells
 The email sequence is like that pattern repeats itself over and over and over again
 And so for you to be good at digital marketing it's just getting really good like what's the hook that's going to grab their attention
 How do I tell a story how do I make an offer and and then you do that you build out your your sales process
 And what I do is I build the sales funnel out I spend maybe a five hundred thousand dollars in ads
 And I sit back and I just look and I look at the numbers and look at the stats
 It's okay. Well page one and page two to go page three didn't do good
 Now see their hook story offer which one is it and we'll go and tweak it try it
 Spend some more money sit back and then see if it works and we try it two over three times
 So all the pages are converting and then and then you've got a funnel and now we can start driving traffic and we can scale it to
 You know 40 50 thousand dollars a day in sales and then that's that's how the game is played
 But it's just really good getting really good at those three simple things which is hook grabbing attention
 Tongue a story making an offer
 I love that. That's really great. So all right. So
 If if you talk about where opportunity lies today
 Online, what would you what would you say where and how?
 Yeah, so the biggest thing online
 I'm sure most people are familiar with is advertising costs are going up
 like that's just a big thing because apple and
 Facebook got a big fight and they start blocking pixels so the advertising costs for everyone's going up and so the
 Because the lot of businesses are are falling away and the businesses
 They're having most success one of dandy candies my favorite quotes to pay from him
 He said whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins
 And so it's having it's having businesses where there's a front end and there's a there's a really good back end
 So my business right now we have I have free books and then I have you know software for a couple hundred dollars a month
 And then I also have a 25 000 dollar coaching program
 I've got a 50 000 dollar coaching program
 I have a 150 000 dollar coaching program
 And so because of that because I'm able to go deep and I have big back end products and services
 That's how I'm able to out compete against everybody else
 I think that the people that are that are having the most success when people understand that like I get a acquire customer
 But I'm going to lose some money
 That's okay because I know that over here
 This is my more expensive thing than I'm going to be selling them
 And I think that's really the the people that are succeeding in thriving right now those who understand that because
 So many advertisers are dying and falling off the platforms
 That eventually I think I feel like the ad costs are going to keep going down because of that
 And it's going to give those who are able to sustain a business because they have a good back end the ability to just
 Start grabbing all that traffic and really scaling and growing quickly
 Yeah, and just to make sure it's translated what he's saying is instead of looking at your your current offer as
 A static this is all i'm doing if you rethink it and say this is the lead generator self liquidating or slight loss on the lead generator to bring
 The first transaction in but i'm going to have
 Many many other ways to monetize it and it doesn't matter
 Whether you currently have those ways. This is where partnering joint venturing co-branding
 buying the rights getting licenses
 You know figuring out what people buy before during after even frankly instead is where you can make a fortune
 Talk towards that
 Yeah, um a good example I saw recently one of my friends owns a company and they do custom suits for i don't know five or 10 000 for these custom suits
 But they were struggling they couldn't advertise that profitably online and get people
 They said well people who are custom suits what we know about them?
 Well, like what's something they all want and the big i'll hide is like well people that wear custom suits usually wear cufflinks
 So they made a cufflink offer they found someone had a bunch of cufflinks
 Um, they put it off from they charge I think it was like free free plus two two dollars 95 cents for these really cool cufflinks
 And it cost them like a hundred dollars to sell a two dollar cufflink
 But from that hundred dollars that was like his dream customer and like one out of five and it buying a custom suit
 And they blew up the business because of that, you know my business. I have softwares our core business
 And so I was like well, you know, it's really expensive like for me right now
 Clickphones the cost me about five hundred dollars or so in advertising to get a free trial which is expensive like
 Cool and I wasn't again. I didn't all my competitors are backed by adventure capitalists
 So they have money that they can they can acquire cut, but I don't I don't have that like all the money comes from my own pocket
 So I was like, okay, I'm gonna go write a book and I'm gonna sell that book and and that's you know
 I'll break even on the book and then from there i'll introduce some clickphones
 I mean a good reason why about Dan Kennedy's company, you know, Dan Kennedy he's written I don't know 50 books
 So I know I have 50 new books I can launch
 People with a click funnels on to write any more books, which is fantastic for me
 So it's just yeah, he said partnering acquiring
 Licensing like looking for something that can be a front-end and it just comes back to again
 Who's the customer's gonna buy the thing you want and then what's something that on the low end that they would want to buy
 You can acquire them really really inexpensive and then from there move them to the more expensive products that you have
