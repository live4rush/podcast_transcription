 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast right now
 I'm driving downtown Boise to the pet house and
 Just had an interesting thought I wanted to share it yet
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 The reason why I want this podcast right now is because
 There's a really interesting
 psychological cell strategy that
 That was used on me to get me to invest in this pet house and
 Just some context I haven't talked a lot about I think I've mentioned like I'm going to the penthouse
 I never talked about what exactly it is and I can go do a ton of detail, but basically downtown Boise
 We purchased a penthouse and it's kind of insane, but it's beautiful and I
 Went to look at initially just because I thought it'd be fun to go look at a pet house right like and
 We got there and it's like on the top floor this building and you see all the Boise is beautiful and it's super cool
 And I'm looking at like this is so cool
 I love this thing, but never once crossed my mind that ever actually buy it like there was it wasn't even like I
 totally went just because I thought it'd be fun to go see you right and
 and
 And walked in walked around and saw the rooms
 I was like this is so cool
 I can't even imagine like living here and how cool I would be and all those you know all the thoughts that kind of go with that and
 Then we walked in this one room and it was the office and it's it's not a huge office
 It's a little office and it overlooks the entire city of Boise
 It's beautiful and they had a desk there in a chair and stuff like that
 as I walked in that room I was there with Dave Woodward my beautiful wife Collette and
 In Brent Co. Peters and the real estate agent. I think I was different. I was there anyway, I'm walking in there
 I'm sitting there in that room. I sit behind the desk
 I'm looking out over the whole city of Boise and Dave said a phrase he said
 Can you imagine sitting in that desk writing the traffic seekers book?
 and
 like for a second I imagined it and I was like oh my gosh like
 How cool would that be sitting here and writing the book and looking over the city and like daydreaming me like figuring out concepts and like writing it on like
 all those all those things right and
 and that was the seed that that visualization of that experience is what made me
 desire this penthouse increased the desire so much so that we ended up buying something that logically makes no logical sense whatsoever
 but because of the vividness of
 That vision I heard something called before vivid vision like because of the vividness of that vision
 it caused me to do something defying all logic and completely go with an emotional cell and and buy it and
 And so I was not sure if yesterday is the power of like of painting a vivid vision for your people to
 dream about why why should some invest in your product or your service and
 You know we have all these things we do all these techniques all these strategies and you know
 We and we talk I talk a lot about these on the podcast in the books right
 And and all of them have important things right like like telling stories to break people's false belief patterns
 They're trump their story. That's such a powerful tool for sales
 You know using urgency and scarcity is so powerful
 But when you look at all those things tied in together
 I think one of the most powerful things that I rarely talked about probably because they couldn't articulate it till
 You're just really this experience to myself was
 How do you paint a vision in your?
 Potential customers mind like not just a vision like a vivid vision that they can feel they can taste they can smell they can see they can
 experience in their mind so much so like they put themselves in that spot like I
 Experience that like I need this I want that that feeling again and
 And it's just something interesting to think about so
 Yeah, cuz it just got me to spend a ton of money and I'm thinking about that with with ClickFunnels in my business
 I think you know unknowingly I've done that a lot of times like trying to paint a vivid vision for for the fun
 Aquacommunity and for our people and for you know everything
 I'm like what's possible what it could look like like what what the future could be if you were to have a funnel
 You know all those kind of things
 But again for me every time you you see when you become aware of something you become aware of the pattern of the concept of the idea
 That it's easier to to amplify it. And so tonight
 This is my one show at the guys is like what's the vivid vision you're trying to cast?
 For your audience like what does that look like they were to experience whatever it is you experience right like the business or the relationship or the
 Whatever it is you're selling right like imagine at the peak like the best possible experience they can have in that moment
 Like what would that look like and how can you paint that in the minds of your prospect?
 You know for me it was Dave sitting there saying man
 Can you imagine like sitting here and writing the traffic seekers book like looking out?
 That's that's the the background they write this thing on and
 Like I did I saw it. I felt that I taste I smelled it like I experienced it and it was so real and so exciting and so
 How do you know the words?
 So much so like I wanted I fought on my side to make that that possible right like I went out of my way to convince myself
 And everyone I love and everyone around me like I must get this thing as opposed to the real estate agent trying to close me
 The real stage didn't do anything didn't do anything just
 You know someone was there who painted the vivid vision and so that's my question for you guys is like
 How do you how do you paint that vivid vision in the minds of your customers?
 And you know part of its story, but it's even more so than that's like experiential like
 If you if you've listened back to any of the episodes about storytelling or the expert secrets book
 You talk about one of the biggest things with with stories like you have to get into the modalities like it's not just like I
 Went to the store and I felt good. That's almost what tells story
 Right, it's like I went to the store and I was walking in I felt this weird tingling down my spine and as I as I
 As I walked through I felt like burst of cold air on my skin
 and and you know and
 And it broke me out of this cold sweat because of the nerves that had I was going through and my hand starts sweating and I walked
 I could feel my heart slowly starting to be faster and faster like you know
 You tell story like that we start bringing in the the the visualization of what you're actually experiencing right like the the mind the
 The body the the gut the like the feelings you fill in you explain those things people
 It becomes more real form right like for Dave in that in that moment because I was sitting there and I could actually experience it
 It was you know, it's more powerful
 I don't need Dave to go to the whole details like you imagine the smell of the wood like because I'm sitting there
 I'm smelling the wood of the desk, right?
 And so so much more powerful in the Winston person and you know, you're able to see it in to fill it
 But when you're not in person and you're on a webinar or a podcast or whatever like how do you how do you paint that vivid vision in such a way that?
 That people experience it right and it's coming in and like telling the story and explaining the senses and what they smelled what they felt
 What they experienced and what they you know all those all those things you're plugging those in to the descriptions
 You're explaining it and that's against people to fill it and experience it before they've ever had it and when they experience that vivid vision
 That's the secret. That's when they start coming to you and they will start convincing themselves
 They're around that they need to buy your product and they will come and they will sell you on why they need your product because because they want it so bad
 So help the helps
 You'll put that up on your on your on your boards
 paint the vivid vision like what's the vision you're gonna pay for your customers and
