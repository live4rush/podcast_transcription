 Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the
 Marketing Secrets Podcast. Right now I'm walking up my stairs
 in my house. That's good of bed but there's just something
 too cool on my mind. I got to share with you right now.
 So the big question is this, how are entrepreneurs like us
 who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money
 from our own pockets? How do we market in a way that lets us
 get our products and our services and the things that we
 believe in out to the world and yet still remain profitable?
 That is the question and this podcast will give you the
 answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing
 Seekers.
 Alright, so I just wanted to share a story that hopefully all
 you guys will have the same story in like 10 years from
 hour 12 years from hour 15 years from now whenever but when
 you're living it in the moment it's kind of annoying but looking
 back in hindsight it's like the most amazing gift ever. So let
 me tell you what I'm talking about. So I first joined my
 first mastermind group over a decade ago now and at the time
 I didn't know how to do anything. I had a couple of websites
 had a little email list of some stuff and I joined this
 mastermind group. It was Bill Glazers mastermind group and I
 get in this group and at the time this is right before the
 real estate bubble popped like in whatever 2008 right or
 whatever that was. And so in the group there are 18 people and
 nine of the 18 people who are real estate coaches right.
 These people how to make money in real estate and the other
 nine were also to other weird businesses so it was kind of
 cool so I came in this room and all these people doing
 amazing things I'm sitting there. The first guy gets
 up and talks about he has a call center I was like oh my
 gosh I should have a call center and the second guy gets up
 he's like oh I do live events. I was like oh my gosh I should
 live in some third guy gets up like I do local events. I'm
 like I should local events the next guy gets up. I run
 radio ads. I'm like I should be running radio ads and luckily
 for me at the time I was super naive and didn't know that I
 probably shouldn't do all of them at once. So instead I'm just
 like dude I need to do all of them at once and so after my
 first set of meetings I go back home and sure enough I try to do
 all those things at once and so for example one of them was
 I remember there's a guy who was doing these local seminars and
 he would run radio ads and direct mail and he'd fill these
 local seminars and then people would come locally and they
 come to seminar he'd sell something to him and then from
 there he'd take him to another event and had his whole process
 right. So I got home and just thought even thinking I'm like
 we're gonna run local seminars and so we went and booked a
 holiday in and we went and I was like how do we fill this
 event this is pre-Facebook pre-MySpace pre like this is a
 decade plus ago right and so I was like well I don't know we
 could read direct mail so I called like a like I call up some
 list broker that I found and I was like do you guys have direct mail
 for people in Boise who want to get rich on the internet and they're
 like I'm sure it will sell you a list like that so they sold me
 list of 5,000 names and then I was like I gotta send a direct
 mail piece out I've never written direct mail piece before but I was
 like yeah I just got to figure it out so I remember
 I made this postcard and because it was in Boise I had pitched me
 wrestling a Boise state so I had a picture of wrestling on this
 business seminar and I was like learn how local Boise state
 wrestling makes money on the internet coming to this free event
 and so we had a phone number for people to call to come in RSVP
 and that was like okay we had the direct mail piece but we got to
 figure out other ways to fill the event what should we do
 right we should do radio ads and so like I called the radio station I'm
 like hey I want to run a radio ad and they're like okay and
 I've been learning about copywriting some of my own little ad
 took the radio station and um the uh the host of the what did we
 call them the the DJ or the whatever it's called the person
 at the radio station who talks on the radio um who's gonna read the ad
 he's just like oh this ad's horrible I'm just gonna freestyle it and so he
 liked wants his own ad I'm like no we have to understand like this is how
 direct response copy works we kind of fought back and forth and so
 we're gonna make him a hybrid ad that he read that had a call to action for
 the live event so we run this local live event we run the direct mail when the
 radio ads we get I don't know a couple hundred people the RSVP and so we set
 it up where we're going to run an event in the morning one afternoon one at
 night and um and so we did that and and the I don't know how many hundreds of
 people signed up we only got a few that actually showed up for each event
 and then they showed up and we didn't know what to sell so I try to sell these
 really weird things they didn't really work and I remember the I did three
 presentations that in the first presentation there's probably 30 people
 in the room and went really well um you know I had my suit and tie and my
 shaved head and my glasses all I did my little thing and I think I sold a
 hundred dollar workbook we sold a few of them and then the next group came and
 there's like three people showed up and I was like it was so awkward I gave the
 same presentation I had done earlier in 90 minutes I didn't like 25 minutes
 because it was just like I was nervous I was talking even faster than Russell
 normally talks which is pretty fast and then third one and I don't think I
 sold any of that group and then third one came as a little bigger and I sold a
 couple and I get made like I made four or five hundred bucks at this little
 event so we had ran and we probably spent five grand trying to probably
 mourn that to direct mail and radio and everything anyway colossal failure I'm
 like I'll never do local events again that was the worst I ever and then
 someone else was like well you should do like your own big events I was like oh
 cool I could do that I went to an event one time I should build a run an event
 and so we just like run into a hotel room and started trying to fill an event
 and it was harder than I thought it was gonna be
 um and um luckily I met a partner Stu McLaren
 uh Stu and I did two or three events together which is awesome because he had
 actually run some events had some I can remember I think the first event we
 ran people showed up and was like all right sit down we had no idea
 what to do we started running in with Stu and Stu like we need to get name tags
 for people like oh that's a great idea like you need to register people like oh
 yeah we didn't even think about that and like they had a process to make these
 events we did two or three events with Stu where we had
 remember we'd go to like Walmart buy a hundred dollar printer and we'd like
 print we go print off all the name tags and then the event we like raffle off
 the the printer like the first person who does whatever will give you a free
 printer it was like a printer we had bought because we didn't want to like
 pack it home and ship it back to our houses
 anyway we did three or four these little events with Stu and made a little
 bit of money and learned learned a lot of good lessons there
 and I remember the last event I did was this one Salt Lake
 and it was the back of um we had a product called a 12-month millionaire
 and it was an interview idea with Vince James where he had made a
 hundred million dollars in 23 months and it was a six-hour interview I did with
 them and so we sold that product and on the back side we
 um we gave everyone who bought a ticket to this live event we're going to teach
 just online offline fusion marketing you know like how to use
 offline tactics with online I was so excited this event and
 I think with like three or four hundred people who had RSVP'd say they're coming
 to the event right we sold like 9,000 copies of that product
 which was amazing but like 300 put the hundred I think it was a hundred
 dollar deposit down to say you're coming to the event so we had
 this event we thought like 300 people coming to us we built out the whole
 thing and um and then we so embarrassing we
 get to the event and like less than a hundred people showed up to it
 and so this huge room is completely empty we had no stage there was like
 little ghetto projector and we did the event and I think we didn't make it
 we sold something in the event and making a little bit of money but not a lot
 and that was the time I was like I will never in my life be live Vince again this
 is that was it we'll never do it again like it's
 I told my team like we'll never do it again um and then fast forward a little
 longer a little while after that we like you know
 someone told me we should build the call center so like we're gonna build a call
 center so as Russell does instead of thinking I just went and like found
 somebody who did a call center we hired them hired more people
 built out a team got some cubicles got some phone starts selling leads and
 started selling stuff and started working and we started growing and
 next day I knew woke up one day and we had 80 salespeople in the room and I'm
 like what in the world is happening like why am I
 like what am I doing right and if you've heard some of my stories about that whole
 crash and how it fell down um but we had figured out you know I learned that
 model and imperfectly and um man so many more we did free
 plus shipping offers with force continuity that we had learned and made
 money with them got shut down because of the force continuity we did
 um just so many things like that right and at the time like I went through the
 process I learned the lesson and then I was like I'll never do this again because
 it was horrible and it was painful and like it didn't work but now it's crazy
 decade later and I'm looking at click funnels as we're growing it now and I'm
 like okay how do we grow this and I'm going back in time a decade ago and I'm
 like remember we do those live events locally
 they didn't work because I didn't understand the model I didn't understand
 what I was selling to him right offer I think those would work now
 like a couple of tweaks and that that model would work so right now we're
 working on a building on a local model we're filling up local events it's any
 speakers these events right funnel hacking live I thought I was click
 funnels and I swore I'd never do events again
 and people were like we need an event we need an event I'm like no I'll never
 do an event again and finally agreed and we did funnel hacking live number one
 which had 600 people number two had 1200 or three hit 1300 or four had
 uh 3000 this year we're gonna 5,000 and we have
 probably um one of the biggest marketing events in the world now
 by far the best I'm not using cynics and bias it literally is the best
 you're not coming here insane um anyway it's like that came on the back of
 like this thing I had tested with years ago and it failed
 but I learned the pieces and the process and I learned enough of the skills
 to know like when I needed it like dust it off bring it back out and this
 time do it right um the call center like we built this huge call center up and
 shut it down and then click phones came out I swore like we will never do a
 call center we're never gonna do a call center we're not gonna build out a
 sales team and sure enough guests are doing right now we're building out a
 sales team we have a front end sales team calling
 new leads we got back and sales team uh selling migration packages and
 things and we're building that out again right now and again something I swear
 I'd never do again but it's something I learned cut my teeth on and now we're
 doing it correctly we're doing it right we're doing it
 um in a way that'll it'll continue to grow the company and so
 it's it's and there's more than these are just two or three different things
 top of my head that we're doing now that I had tested a decade ago
 now we're finally doing it so I'm sharing with you guys because I'm
 guessing if you're all I can mean um you've tested and tried a lot of things
 and some of them haven't worked and the time you probably were like I was
 saying local the local seminars are scam I would never do this this is the worst
 business ever we ever told me that to do that was more on right
 um but it's just the context the the situation wasn't right yet but now I
 have that skill that I'm we're bringing back right and so if you get the same
 thing like I know that um you're trying these you're testing things
 something's aren't working but I promise you that like there's a reason why
 you're learning it okay and just because the first funnel or second or the
 third or the fourth to fifth or sixth or tenth
 tenth offer doesn't work it's okay because you're learning how to make offers
 right um I'm working on a presentation I'm speaking at
 Garrett White's um Warrior Week next week and one of the sections I'm talking
 about hook story and offers and talking about how you need to make offers and
 whoever makes the most offers in the marketplace traditionally wins
 and then I'm going to actually show all the offers I created from the beginning
 of time until clickfuddles a lot of people think oh there's probably 10
 offers or dozen offers or you know a couple dozen
 but there are over 100 offers I made before I made the clickfuddles offer
 over 100 okay and these weren't just like things I threw out quickly on a
 Facebook live it's like 100 full-blown funnels with
 headline, sales video, product, creation like all those things over 100
 different offers I created before we created the clickfuddles offer
 okay and so it's it's all those things it's just a consistency of doing it and
 doing it because you have no idea which one of the skills you learn in this
 process you're going to come back and later later use
 to scale your empire to serve more people to get your message out to the market
 same thing happened in network marketing like I can't tell you how many times
 um you know I tried network marketing had ups and downs and pros and cons and
 it's funny because last week uh David Fry is one of my favorite people I've ever
 met um he posts this whole thing like if I was
 still doing network marketing this is exactly what he mapped out this whole
 strategy of how he'd do really his local events and how he'd film and how he'd
 do it and how he'd build the whole thing up and I was just like oh my gosh
 and three or four ideas I'm like I remember when we did local events for network
 marketing I literally we literally ran our own local events for that
 and what do we do and why do we do and how did it work and like what are
 what are the things we've learned that we can bring back and like and plug back
 into our to our thing in fact I have never one time
 it was uh we were said out cards and we had this idea where I went if
 we um put an ad in Craigslist looking for people who
 run home parties and pay them a hundred dollars
 maybe just three hundred dollars whatever it was the same cost as it was to be
 distributor but paid them to come and consult us on how to run a home party
 for this new company that we were trying to roll out
 this was like the greatest idea ever it didn't work well it kind of worked
 but anyway so we put ads on Craigslist and we had like
 I have 20 people who were like home party experts they'd run home parties
 for different companies and they agreed to come and train us
 in a group um for a hundred dollars or two hundred dollars whatever it actually
 was and so we sat down and um we showed them the product and then they
 were just like kind of right at a home party and like scripted a process and
 show it to us and so they had to try the product tested out and like
 use it and it was done we did is get each person come one on one into a room
 back with me and I'm so proud of myself for trying this
 and I was like can we think about the product like oh it's amazing it's okay
 well we owe you three hundred dollars to do the same or
 um I think it was the hundred dollars you pay hundred dollars
 for your time or um I'll pay three hundred dollars to cover your distributor fee and
 set out cards which is you rather do and a couple people were like I saw a hundred
 bucks and then like half of them were like um pay the three hundred bucks I'll
 become a distributor like you sold me on the product I'm now sold on it
 and then our thought was like oh my gosh I have these people now who
 they know how to home parties they decide for a company maybe they're gonna go
 go and do home parties right um and a couple of them did it never grew
 really big but conceptually it was brilliant I think anyway it might have
 been the worst idea ever but it was something we just tried right and there's
 so many things we tested over and over and over and over and over again trying to
 figure out what was gonna stick and so um anyway I just hope it gives you
 guys encouragement for those who were trying things aren't working
 you're not working as effectively as you wanted or you thought
 I thought for sure this was I thought this webinar Russell told me he's gonna
 be the biggest thing in the world I tested the webinar didn't work and
 you're all angry but it's like look maybe it's just because it's the wrong
 offer maybe you got to make another offer change it offer or try a different
 product or try a different venue maybe instead of doing a webinar maybe it's
 a tele seminar maybe it's a live event maybe it's a local who knows
 but like the skillset you're learning each of these steps along the way is
 gonna help you for the next piece and the next thing
 um and so don't discount the education you're getting
 um each of your failures so that's the message for today
 I'm gonna go to bed I gotta get tomorrow morning at um five
