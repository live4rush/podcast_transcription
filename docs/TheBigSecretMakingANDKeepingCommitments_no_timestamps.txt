 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marking
 seekers podcast hope you guys are ready for some fun so the big question is this
 how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for
 spending money from our own pockets how do we mark it in a way that lets us get
 our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the
 world and yet still remain profitable that is the question in this podcast
 we'll give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing
 seekers
 all right everyone so I had just dropped something off my kids school because
 yes once again they forgot something they sound like their dad anyway I just
 want to jump on today because I if you've been listening you know that I
 recently hired another coach in my life I try to have at least one if not multiple
 coaches at any given time coach me through different stuff because I found
 that in fact I saw my kids this last night I said if you want to be successful
 whatever it is like pick the thing you want to success a lot first like a school
 basketball trombone whatever it is and then number two is find a coach to
 actually coach you through it and so that so I told them last night when I was
 coming to bed and I told them I was like and I actually I preached I figured out
 stuff I want to be better at my life and then I go find a coach to coach me
 through the process home accountable so a little while ago I was listening to
 podcast from Ryan Moran and Jeff Woods and talking about the one thing and
 anyway loved it so called Jeff and hired him and he's been coaching through
 things so I had my second coaching call today and I wanted to post this here next
 drive by because I want to make this video just kind of walk us through how to be
 coachable because it's shocking to me how uncoachable most people are and
 fact I did a periscope about this like two two years ago or something like that
 about that and that is funny because I remember when I was wrestling I started
 in freestyle Greco and that kind of happens during the offseason I had this
 coach his name is Greg Williams who's now the coach at UVU anyway he he would
 go and teach me stuff and then I remember like between matches like he could
 pull me sides like hey you need a level change better you got a lower your
 whatever and like you know just walk me through I need to do and I'd go back out
 and I would just do the thing he told me and I remember because he told me
 afterwards like after I've been program probably years so he said you're one of
 the most most coachable athletes that I've ever had he's like you're not the
 most talented but one of the most coachable and I was like I don't even it was
 I mean coachable he's like well most people I tell them what to do and then
 they listen they nod their head and they don't do it and he said with you he's
 like I tell you to do this at the next match you go when you do that thing and
 he's like that's not normal and most people don't do that he said you're
 really really coachable and I was like huh I just didn't everyone just did that
 but they have a coach they believe in why would they just listen what they say
 and then do it I had a podcast a couple weeks ago talking about you know pick a
 mentor listen and then do right like same thing and I look at this funny Dan
 Henry if you guys know Dan he's one of our inner circle members who bought the
 dot-com seekers book read the chapter on perfect webinar did a perfect webinar
 in five within five months made a million bucks so he went into the Click
 problems group this weekend and he was like hey guys he's like I just you know
 what's the top of the webinar I did it made million bucks like why aren't you
 guys all just doing that like he was kind of confused okay Dan's very coachable
 and then there's like a hundred as this morning 170 comments from people and
 it was basically 170 excuses why people hadn't done yet well I'm still working
 on my slides well I just you know I'm not really a pitch person oh well I just I
 can't figure out my offer oh well and like thing after thing he's like dude
 just freaking do it like you got the best coach in the world to tell you and
 it was funny because even one guy who was a coach was like well I've coached my
 people doesn't work for everyone and Dan's comment was like well you must not
 be very coach like it was awesome so but uh but kind of again the the point of
 this is like being coachable it's like just doing what the coach says and anyway
 so it's been fun because I've had one coach for the last year that I'm working
 with on one aspect of my life and she's been awesome and I'm not perfect at doing
 what she says but but I think I'm pretty good at doing that and then I soon
 like I was with most people but Jeff's been coaching me and it's funny because
 like this is our second coaching call this morning and one thing he's wanted
 to do it and have a time to do it and instead of like let me off okay oh okay
 you can do it next week he was like anyway or she can hear it it was in the
 first like 30 seconds the thing he's like you know some about what happened
 I was like oh why I'm actually doing this week because Todd's flying fact Todd's
 flying in today from the last Todd's my partner click funnels and I was like
 we're doing a lot of planning stuff at that and he was just like he's like
 having your planning would have better if you would actually finish this and I was
 like oh crap probably better and then anyway so it's kind of like help me
 out feed the fire and then and then this call is like basically like okay next
 week these things you have to have done by you know he's like when you have
 these done I was like Friday's like that's not specific enough right Friday at
 4 30 my times like cool and if you don't get done what happens I was like you're
 gonna punish me baby he's like if you don't have it done by Friday at 4 30
 we're canceling the call for next Monday I was like oh crap oh he told
 my feet to the fire and it was like so many things I could I could walk you
 through from a coaching standpoint what I'm enjoying about getting coached by him
 but it was just it was just making me make sure I do it right like and I think
 one of the problems a lot of us have is we let ourselves off the hook in fact I
 did it and I get I'm very very coachable person and even with that like this
 week I was like I let myself off the hook like oh I don't need to finish this part
 of it because of this and yet I committed to the getting that part done and
 it's just interesting you know it's funny because the throughout the week I was
 proud like he's we kind of picked out the one thing I was gonna focus on for
 the week and from that I had like found the person if I found the role I was
 looking for found the person doing the interview process like going through the
 whole thing like I was kind of like impressed how fast I was moving but yet I
 hadn't followed through in all my commitments I'd done most of them but not
 all of them and it was just like crap I got to remember that like I got a I got
 a make and keep commitments like people to succeed in life there's one like
 really strange common albutin all of them they're good not just making
 commitments a lot of you ever can make them and I'm gonna do this right I'm gonna
 lose weight I'm gonna make money I'm gonna blah blah blah like everyone's gonna
 make him commitments but people are successful good at making and keeping
 commitments and I failed but what am I commitments from this week and it sucks
 and I'm like God just ding it like I just frustrated me so like I know
 better than that like I'm someone who makes and keeps commitments and I didn't
 on one of the things I kept most of them but I didn't keep this one and so those
 gets you want to be you want to be coachable and want to have success and
 understanding like the big commonality is that the success people are making and
 keeping commitment so again once again find a coach or whatever it is and then
 make commitment and then keep that commitment and just do it and don't give
 it all excuses Alex or Mosey at the last near circle meeting said that any every
 sales call you're on someone's getting sold either you're selling them on the
 product assurance that they need or they're selling you like excuse why they
 can't get it and it's just like dang that's so interesting like you were buying
 the excuse or they're buying the product and it's the same thing for us like like
 if like I just look at that thread of 170 plus people who like they each had
 their excuse why why they had done it yet and Dan was like dude I didn't within
 five months was a millionaire like why don't you guys just do it and like oh
 well and they're selling themselves on excuses opposed to just like making
 a commitment and then keeping the commitment so that is my message for
 today make and keep commitments all successful people do they're good at
 making them and good at keeping them I felt this week I made much
 payments and I kept almost all of them but I did not keep all of them so this
 week I'm gonna make and keep commitments to myself to my coaches and to the people
 that I love and care about and that I work with and I work for and I serve and
 all that kind of stuff so that's my my goal and my game plan is to make and
 keep commitments this week and be very specific I'm right down all commitments
 I make and make sure that I keep each and every one of them and that is
 the path of success so there you go guys hope that helps make keep commitments
 write them down and make sure you do them and don't yourself off the hook
 otherwise you'll just keep making excuses and again if if you're buying
 that excuse then you didn't you didn't buy the thing you actually got to do so
 that's like I got you guys on the end of the day it's gonna be a fun week I get
 to work all week Todd's in town we're gonna plan we're gonna plot we're gonna
 scheme we're gonna make click funnels even better if that's possible for all
