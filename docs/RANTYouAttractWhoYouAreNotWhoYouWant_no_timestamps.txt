 What's up everybody today? I want to welcome you to the marketing secrets rent. That's right today. We're going on a rant
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right that a rant often I'm a pretty positive guy
 but I
 am slightly annoyed this morning and
 It's because
 People like I kill myself to try to serve people I try my best I make your just offers a step all night at work hard
 I create good things I spend millions of dollars acquiring companies so I can give it to people in a simplified format and change their lives and I
 risk
 Insane amounts try to give people my entire everything for almost nothing like it is it is ridiculous
 We look at like just like and this is coming in the middle of us launching the whole Dan Kennedy relaunch the new offer
 The new newsletter all kind of stuff right and so the context of it is like and yes
 I'm gonna make money in the long term because that's you know
 I'm if you look at my disk profile my value and number one values ROI so if I get to the ROI of something
 I don't do it
 So yes, there's a huge positive ROI and I get it
 I'm gonna make a bunch of money on the deal when all said and done but
 one people understand like the
 Investment up front for me to be able to give people access this information right first off
 I had to buy Dan Kennedy's company for multiple multiple millions of dollars of front right
 So there's that then I'd go through all this stuff and then
 Negotiating and working and then writing the newsletter writing the offering creating this offer and hiring
 copywriters and designers and product like via front costs now in in me being able to give people access to
 the most incredible free gift ever is insane like
 like
 Yeah, multiple multiple multiple millions of dollars plus time effort stress headache to be able to give people this offer
 We're literally giving people twenty thousand dollars of bonuses for free when they subscribe to this newsletter, right?
 And so for me, it's like man if people realize what it's taken me to be able to give this thing people as a gift
 It would be it'd be awesome right like they make man. Russell. I can't believe how much money you invested so that I could have access to this really cool thing, right?
 And that's literally $97 a month after the trial and you get a whole 30-day trial
 You get full newsletter for free and you get $20,000 in products and bonuses and all stuff
 The Russell has spent multiple millions of dollars on you get it all for free just for like test driving this newsletter, right?
 And I get it's the offer so it's exciting
 But what blows my mind is and again, I'm speaking I'm speaking to the choir and preaching to the choir, right?
 Most everyone is cool and understanding, but there's a small percentage of people who literally
 Hate success so much that they like put up all these barriers to make them not be successful
 And it blows my mind and it's all just a little mindset thing
 It's like a little tweak in their brains they keep them from having success and it's a pattern that's in happening throughout the rest
 They throughout their lives and so and so typically I kind of like shelter myself for most of the the feedback
 That's not positive or that people have
 Because just you know our community is so big now that if I looked at every complaint every frustration of everything
 It would drown me and I would not want to produce
 So I've gatekeepers and they're almost everywhere to make sure that
 I'm focusing on positive things and they're taking care of any of the clean-up stuff that we need to do, right?
 And that's the true to any business
 But I think right now it's because we're in this launch is like I know how much I've invested how much I'm killing myself
 Hopefully in a year to get a positive ROI on my investment and then you know continue to serve people right?
 But it's just funny because like because it's in this little launch
 I'm in the Facebook person and the things like I'm more aware of all the stuff
 And so while I see the positive
 I also the few negatives a pop-up right blaringly in my face and it's just like you know
 Like in the morning open Facebook and first thing I see other people who you know are the negative ones like they somehow magically Facebook
 Let's their their posts the first thing I see my feet every morning and so
 Anyway, so I wanted to I wanted to talk about this. This is my rant
 And hopefully we'll serve
 Three to you hopefully in one way or the other
 So if you rewind back to pre you know Russell Brunson as you know now back when we were doing events before fun hacking live
 And he's that where they were small we would do these events in our office that anywhere from
 You know 10 people at the small at the low end to you know 34 people 30 to 40 people in the big end
 And we do these workshops people come to Boise
 We do these little mini events and we take them around the office and we train them and it was really fun
 but was always fascinating to me is within about five minutes of me having one in the room and and
 You know starting to talk and answer some questions introduce some people
 I could tell within five minutes with almost 100% accuracy is someone to be successful or not is fascinating
 In fact, I would I would take literally do my initial reductions
 I talk a little bit ask him Q&A and then given their first time they've working on I could I would sit down and I'd like write the names like
 These are the three people be success like hyper successful
 These 80% got kind of a shot and these 20% whatever like like there's no way like I should refund their money
 Instead of all because there's no way in infinity years. They will have already success of any of this
 I would know within five minutes. It was crazy
 Right and it had a 100% do like mindset and attitude
 It was crazy and then we'd track people over the next year five years 10 years and we'd see it and sure enough like with almost 100% accuracy
 It was true and there were there were some shit
 There were some people who change right and they were the people who like who shifted from like
 Blaming the world also and they take me personal accountability and like when a mistake would come up
 They would no longer I freak out they were just whatever people invest in themselves people who are like grateful for the investment
 People who didn't complain about the investments. It was crazy to me
 And there's a principle I learned from iron gold and myron says you don't attract who you want
 You attract who you are
 Okay, write that one down like you don't attract who you want you attract who you are
 So if you look at like the way you interact with it with the businesses you do business with right like
 If you come on here and you listen to my podcast and you take notes and you study and you apply and you do those kind of things
 Was fascinating is that because that's the type of person you are you're gonna track that kind of person
 So if you have a podcast you're gonna try kind of people who go and they do that thing right?
 But if you come in and you sign up for a continuity program for example, right?
 Maybe this is just the example I saw this morning
 So it's top of my mind from an annoying standpoint
 But this person signed up they wanted a $20,000 free gifts
 which I get to see offer but they wanted to make sure that we didn't ship in the newsletter because
 You know, I think they live in different countries
 So instead of the $97 a month was gonna cost them $140 a month to get the newsletter to their country and they didn't want that
 They just wanted the free gifts and they wanted to refund as quick as possible
 They wanted to cancel the blah blah and they you know instead of just you know going to the help desk and canceling
 They had to go to Facebook and post it and tell everybody why they were canceling and the reason and the purpose is and
 And why wasn't worth it?
 They just wanted the bonuses and that's why they were there and they weren't for it. I'm like oh my gosh like
 That that per I guarantee you I would bet a million dollars that person will never
 Break the seven figure marketing business ever probably not the six figure mark and probably not anything because guess what?
 The kind of person they are the kind of consumer the kind of buyer they are they're gonna attract people who are like them
 They're gonna attract people coming for the free offer and then cancel as quick as possible
 They're gonna attract people who go to the free lunch in to hear the seminar pitch, right?
 But then they'll never buy because that's who they are right like if you're a kind of person who's gonna come and get a free lunch
 And they're not not pay for the thing later
 Like that's gonna be the kind of person you track because subconsciously you're gonna create the offer and create the structure the way you pitch it
 And your belief level all those things are gonna be synced with how you would have reacted to the offer
 And if you're the kind of person reacts where it's that you come in and you cancel and you you you come and you take and you never give
 If that's the kind of person you are guess what?
 That's the kind of person you're gonna attract because subconsciously everything you do from how you pitch the product and service to the credit
 Create the offer to the funnel all the things are gonna be synced because we don't attract who we want we attract who we are
 Right and so I'm telling you this as a warning because I know I'm preaching the choir
 I know that the people who are listening to podcasts are the are the best the best right you are the people who are the doers the
 Implementers the the people who are listening and actually doing something with this stuff
 But I want you to understand that like like look at your interactions
 if you're kind of person who buys a product and then and then
 Complains and then refunds and posts to the Facebook group out right I happy and all kind of stuff like that's the kind of customers
 You were gonna attract I promise you that but you can personally buy something invest and says Katie look
 This isn't on the product owner to entertain me in the well me
 It's my job to dig through this stuff and find the one gold nugget. That's not gonna be worth the $97 this month
 It's gonna be worth the the hundred thousand dollars like like that's that's the kind of person you're gonna attract right?
 I look at the newsletter for example like I know you guys don't know behind the scenes of it all
 But you know we acquired Dan Kaney's companies had a newsletter that's been raised since 1992
 And for years Dan ran it was amazing and then you know this private equity company bought Dan's company and they you know
 Last decade the newsletters kind of it hasn't been amazing right so I've taken it over right January 1st
 Is the brand new like issue number one and I'm fired up and I'm excited
 I was like I want to make sure this is amazing
 And so I look at like what's my role my role is in each newsletters to curate the best stuff right so
 You know they offer basically get two newsletters a month you get the no BS
 Newers letter from Dan like the very beginning of the month and the middle month to get the behind the scenes another newsletter for me
 So with Dan's thing like when I renegotiate his contract
 I was like hey I want each issue to focus on a topic that I have curated of all the Dan stuff 40 years of stuff
 Like what do I think are the most important principles and topics he taught right?
 So for example January 1st the thing he's talking is opportunity versus improvement
 This is how we structure offers if you've read the extra secrets book
 You know I've talked about this right it's one of the most valuable most powerful most important things you could possibly do
 So like Dan I want you to I want you to go and talk about this again
 So Dan went and you know based on like me curating all things I teach them in January
 What's the most valuable thing I can give them it's opportunity versus improvement right so I had Dan going right a special like
 New updated thing about that specific I put a newsletter and I took that and I took my you know 20 years of info now and I curated
 Dan stuff with me taking the best of what I've learned and how when I learned from Dan how I applied it the
 Examples the case is all kind of stuff and I put it in this newsletter
 So now you get this newsletter and it's like not not me going through you know
 And obviously we're giving it a $20,000 bonus people who join the thing
 But $20,000 bonus time you got a week through all the stuff and find the principles for your applying
 I went through and did all the work for you
 I've spent and probably a week of my time which if you look at how I build my hourly rates
 I mean that's like you know four or five hundred thousand dollars worth of if you were to hire me to do this
 Went through all the dance stuff found the things pulled out the best stuff right it wrote my
 Context around Dan's article put Dan's article in there and everything and now it's there and those who signed up get that for free in January
 Right and worst case if you're a lifelong member you got to pay ninety some dollars to get that
 But it's like I spent a week of my life curating and figure out the best stuff
 Simplified organize put into a spot where it's like this is the thing you should be focusing on today
 Right and then two weeks later to get the next thing
 Which is me showing behind the scenes of arguably the the membership funnel that has got the highest average card value
 I've ever seen that's gonna give me the ability to outspend every other membership site on the planet because
 We figured out the card value to me showing me how this seems like here's page one here's page two
 Here's page three here's page four here's what we did here's why we did it and like that comes as well like
 For free right like that's the first two issues you get for free when you signed up
 I get's insane, but there's people like oh look I don't want to I don't want to pay the hundred fifty dollars
 Cuz I got a pay tat I got a shipping because it's coming further for me, right?
 Okay, I'm sorry that you're gonna pay an extra fifty dollars like and instead of just you know quietly canceling
 Let's go and make a big deal out on Facebook and the Facebooker because you're an idiot right like that
 That's the rally of it that person will never be successful. There's no chance on this planet that person will have success in their business because guess what?
 They're gonna attract who they are not who they want and they're gonna attract a bunch of people like them who get the offer who complain who go
 Post about on Facebook who do all these things as opposed to like either number one being grateful like oh my gosh like hundred bucks
 I'm getting all of this hand delivered to me twice a month like that's insane or like hey
 Maybe it's not for me and I understand that maybe it's not for you
 I get it, but then just quietly going and canceling and then get back to to what you're doing right like anyway
 It just blows my mind so I
 Just want to run a little bit again. I know I'm preaching the choir, but you attract who you are
 Not who you want so become the kind of customer you want to be become the kind of buyer you want to be right in my
 20+ years to do this
 I've only refunded something once and then the person actually give me the refund instead of complaining or posting for my thought
 You know what who cares and I didn't worry about it, but I don't ask three funds
 I don't ship things back right it's not on the product owners on my job
 It's they like the person put the time effort into them and they get it and I got to find the nug
 I got to dig to this. I got to find it and if I don't find it as on me not on that
 Right I take personal responsibility for everything so guess what happens as a majority
 I attract people who take personal responsibility like oh because I want to attract who I am and so I try to become the kind of person
 I want to serve right and so for you. It's the same kind of thing. I want you things to anyway
 Nor's got a Christmas concert a I gotta go. I hope you guys are awesome and I'll talk to you soon. Bye. Bye, bye
