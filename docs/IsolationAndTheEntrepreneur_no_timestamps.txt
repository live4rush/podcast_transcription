 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to mark these tickets podcast. I'm taking a quick break during my lunch at inner circle meetings to
 Share something really cool with you guys today, and I hope you enjoy it. So with that said, let's keep the theme song
 I'll be right back
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everyone ah this is the last two weeks has been it's been crazy as you probably know we have a
 Lot of the coaching programs here at ClickFunnels. We have
 Obviously the free stuff which is the podcast like you're on our now a bunch of other things from there
 We try to get people into the one funnel way challenge
 And hopefully all of you have done that if you haven't gone through that process
 You go to one funnel way chow or see one funnel way calm and after most one fun way challenge
 I try to you get you to come to fun hacking live where you get experience this whole funnel hacking movement
 And if you haven't come to that yet come to our next event
 We'll do it once a year and it's amazing
 You can go to funnel hacking live calm to get access to the event
 And then after fun hacking live then we try to get people into our two comic club X coaching program
 We help people to to build when their own two comic club board and then after somebody has been in that program
 And they've been there for a while
 They got point where their funnels may at least half million dollars and they get invited into our two comic club X platinum group
 which means they get to come to Boise and do master mining with some of our coaches and
 then
 From that group the two comic club X platinum group is where we start picking out people for my inner circle
 and my inner circle has a hundred people that are allowed to be at any given time and then
 We're also developing one more tier of our value ladder. It's called the
 It's called the category king council and it's
 Not live or launched yet
 But it'll be a really high-end thing where people who are category kings in the market have a chance to become part of that
 And that my friends is the click funnels value ladder case
 I was wondering like where where are we taking you where it's what's the purpose? What's the point and so um?
 That's that's that's it and so my goal for you guys is to get tons of value from this
 Podcast of all the free stuff we put out there so much so that you're like man
 I gotta I got that deeper than hopefully read a book or something and then from there you go the one fun way challenge
 And if we keep serving you you'll keep moving up our value ladder
 That's how business should be and if you read the dot-com secrets book
 That's what I talk about at the very beginning with a value ladder and how it works and for me
 I love it. I love I love because higher value ladder people get the more chance I have to work directly with them
 And so this last two weeks has been a minor circle meeting so
 Basically, I break the group down into three groups and they each come to Boise and we spend times in groups of you know
 25 30 of us at a time and
 Two days each so we did you know a group last week
 Last Monday Tuesday and in this Monday Tuesday at a group and right now
 It's Thursday Friday is my last group and so had chance to spend time with all these entrepreneurs and we get together
 We have a chance to look at each other's businesses and our lives and what we're doing and
 Anyway, it's one of my most fulfilling parts of the business for sure
 It's interesting people always asking like why are you still coaching you make so much money off click funnels?
 Why are you still doing this other stuff?
 And it's funny because I told all the other groups of the last day and I'll tell these guys
 You know this group after lunch when we finish the same thing
 I tell them that that for me that the mastermind group puts meaning to the numbers right like I'm looking at the click funnel scoreboard
 I'm sorry now and that's up to you have 89,000 14 active users, which is insane, right?
 But it's it's just a scoreboard and the people in the groups is what gives meaning to those numbers because why can't personally coach all 89,000
 14 people like I would love to
 I
 Can you know I can try and so it gives podcast I try to give it to all of them and more for free
 And then you know from there we get people into the challenge and then the fun lacking live and then the coaching program to
 comic up coaching program then to comic club X platinum and then inner circle and so you know
 Because I can't work out 89,000 the ones I do have a chance to work one-on-one with like the inner circle
 It's they give meaning to those numbers and I see each of their lives and and the people that they're affecting through their businesses and their products
 their services and it gives meaning
 For me and for our entire team and so it's been a lot of fun last last couple weeks
 And so I'm like excited for to be done because I'm tired and it's been you know a lot of work
 But I'm also sad because I'm gonna be losing all my friends and my connections and all these amazing entrepreneurs
 I have a chance to to serve and to work with so
 and I'm leading that up because
 It's been interesting in my business
 I always help people entrepreneurship is like the loneliest job in the world right because when you first get started
 It's just you and your brain and usually the people around you are not supportive or they're confused and they don't understand it
 And then as you go deeper into it
 You know usually there's even more lonely times because you know first you're not making money you're broke
 You're losing money and then there's the fear which causes more loneliness and and some people never make it out of that trap
 And it's it's sad for me
 It's why I've spent so much time over the last decade and a half trying to to build a community
 We know we call ourselves funnel hackers, but I'm trying to build a community
 So that entrepreneurs who are trying to brave this journey alone don't feel alone, which I know a lot of us do at times
 and so
 There's that then there's this next set of phase
 Which is weird where you start bringing on a team and it's exciting at first
 And also and there's other people to talk to about what you're doing what you're learning and they're excited by it too
 And they're growing and it's like the the start of phase and for me
 I think that's my favorite phase of the business is the start of phase because everything's so new and exciting and and
 Yeah, that phase is so much fun
 And and also you start getting connection with these other people you're working with and like that phase is so much fun
 Because now you're not as lonely because you have these other people and and companies growing right and then it gets the point where there's these weird stress
 Where something happens right where the company starts collapsing or employees aren't working hard
 You have to fire someone or whatever that is and really quickly use the founder and the CEO
 As soon as you have to like stop being everybody's friends and start becoming their bosses it causes this new
 weird isolation
 where
 You know, it wasn't the same as it was at first like the very first was me and my buddies and
 Like it's so funny looking back on I remember, you know
 I had this little house apartment that we were had as our office and and two or three of the guys were working for me
 Lived in it and so like I come from my house over to the office
 Which was just a house and walk in it would smell like little smokies little hot dogs
 They were cooking little smokies and I walk in and stinks and they're all in their jammies and they're hanging out like watching TV and
 Goofing video games. I'm like all right guys now. This is an office
 Let's get back to work
 We'd you know get to work and try to you know try to be like a real business and make that was the beginnings right
 I was just bunch of friends hanging out and
 And like I said as you start growing into
 More than that then either you just fire someone or you have to let people go or there's like you have to be their boss and other friends
 And it causes the separation or isolation or the business start struggling and you know for me
 It was these people all need to get paid every two weeks whether we may have money or not
 And so it caused isolation for me because I had to go fair to make money because I had all the stress of making sure I could pay
 Them and and that was the next phase and it's kind of weird cuz I feel like
 You know again
 I'm lonely at first and I get some friends and it goes in loneliness again and and it's been interesting in
 Just my role here at ClickFunnels, you know for a long time. I was I was CEO
 Whatever that means but I was more like running the funnel team right we were building funnels and it was
 So much fun
 You first was just me and then Stephen came it was me and Stephen and then and then Stephen left them
 We brought in Jake and Nick and Karen these other people and like and it became this team
 It was so much fun and then and then it clicked on to become bigger and bigger
 You know I wasn't able to keep doing my role like I had to be the CEO and the content developer and this and all these different things
 You know and so for the last man almost not quite a year yet
 But I've been making this transition and if he has listened to podcast you remember some of the podcast episodes me talking about this
 scary change right from
 from you know being the all-star to being a coach and and I've had to try make those transitions which
 Have not been I mean there are hard transitions like you know find the right people to replace what you're doing
 And you know luckily we had had Julie story and come in and really take over my role in marketing
 She's done an amazing job and building a team and managing the team and like
 That whole thing has been amazing watching that
 But then it's like now she's she gets to be friends with all my friends and then I'm in this office by myself
 I call by myself and it's it's weird cuz put me back into this weird
 Phase of the business where I'm back to like the isolation of it
 It's just just interesting how the cycles go and so I've noticed that over the last
 Couple months is you know I've been doing my thing. I've been doing the roles and supposed to be doing
 I've been producing content and doing the CEO thing
 But I definitely have felt more isolation and loneliness and so a couple of things number one is don't feel bad for me
 I'm fine
 But the last two weeks has been fun to kind of get around
 Entrepreneursing and getting the the stimulus from that and the brains
 You know firing an excitement and that that's been really really fun
 But the second thing and I'm gonna tell you guys this because this is the big takeaway hopefully for you is
 either realization of like I
 If I if I don't have the connection from it, then it's not worth it to me
 I'm like I have to figure out how to do that
 I didn't know how to do it for a long time
 I just felt like stuck and lost a little bit and so for me when I'm starting to do and this is actually starting next week
 Which I'm excited for is like is
 I'm looking at those things I used to miss the most and I'm trying to bring parts those back like I obviously can't go 100%
 Back to that because there's other people doing the roles plus, you know, I'm I'm in charge of the stuff that I'm in charge of and so
 But I'm basically I'm every Monday when I when I get the office I'm working
 I'm gonna be working in the section with the funnel team is so I can be out there
 I can feel the energy I can talk I can share I can train I can give ideas like I can be around that while I'm doing my stuff
 Right as opposed to my my little Russell office and then the days
 I'm supposed to be locked down writing whatever instead of just me locking down in isolation and you're not knowing who to share my thoughts
 With I'm literally trying to find people come work with me
 So like you know talk to Dave like hey Dave like this day
 I'm working in the office just come work in there same time as me
 You don't like just do your same thing
 But like just be around me so that as I have ideas I can bounce them off you right or Stephen Larson
 I'm talking to Stephen like Stephen
 I want to recruit you to come hang out with me one day a week at work at the same time I'm working
 And he's like that'd be awesome and just you know like those kind of things and so just
 For all of you guys because I know this journey I've been on it for 15 years now
 It's entrepreneurs. I know that there's definitely that loneliness
 And so what I just recommended for you is because some people get caught in that loneliness and they never recover is
 Trying to find people like I've tried again
 I've tried to build this amazing funnel hacker community for myself and for you guys to be look happen to people
 I would look at that and and look people local area and find funnel hackers close to you find people that
 You know do the same thing and make sure to connect them even if you're not working together on the same business
 Just working the same spot or maybe once a week you all go to a coffee shop or a
 You know whatever and use to work together so you can rebuild that connection because
 The isolation is real and it can it can cripple you from from moving forward and the worst will make it
 Possibly happen for you and for the people that you've been called to serve is for you to feel isolated not
 And I get your message out because of that so anyway
 I hope that helps hope that any of you guys who are struggling with that to know that you're not alone
 I felt that multiple times throughout this journey as well and recently I said I've been feeling it as well and this inner circle
 Really has helped reignite my excitement and my passion and then to not lose that
 I'm building structure around that I'm trying to build structure to get people to be around me as I'm working
 Just so I can keep the connection and enjoy from that part of what we do so hope that helps
 And with that said I'm gonna go hang out with my friends for the last four or five hours before
 Before they leave me and they all go back to their homes for six months
 and and
 Yeah, I'm excited and I'm feeling really good right now
 Hopefully you are as well if not go plug in the communities here
 I built it for you
 There's hundreds of thousands of funnel hackers who will support you and work with you just go go to the Facebook group
 Go wherever and connect with them and meet up them and and hopefully you guys will come join me on this journey at my value ladder
