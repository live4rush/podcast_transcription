 Hey, what's up everyone? This is Russell Brunson and I'm excited today's episode is gonna be a little bit different
 right now I'm working on a project with Dan Kennedy and
 For years he used to send a weekly fax to his diamond members and right now we're putting all those into a book and
 There's a bunch of cool things happening with it. It's insane
 But one of the faxes I just stumbled upon it and the title caught me
 I had read it and then it was so good. I wanted to read to you
 So the title of this fax Dan Kennedy is called parables of the Batman
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing sick days
 All right, so like I said I'm working this project with Dan Kennedy we're putting together all his
 faxes people used to pay
 $200 a month to be a diamond member. They still do actually sorry and
 and in that program for like a five or six seven year period of time Dan would send them a weekly fax and
 I found in the archives all these faxes. They're insanely cool like Dan's thoughts on whatever was thinking about that week
 It's literally fun
 And so actually putting together into a book that eventually will be giving to all diamond members
 So if you want more of these you're gonna need to upgrade to become a magnetic marketing diamond member here in the future
 That'll be the bribe is giving everyone this book of all the dance faxes for my cuz seven year window
 But anyway as I'm going through the book. I found this one
 Obviously as no, I'm a superhero fan Batman fan
 I'm all the things and so this fax is I scrolling through the the book before we sent out to print
 The title of this fax was called parables of the Batman
 And so of course I'd read it and it's so cool. I want to read you too. So here we go
 This is in Dan's words from his facts
 He said I finally got around to watching the dark night rises the third and final and only disappointing film in the trilogy produced by Chris
 For Nolan in it. There is a hellhole of a prison deep beneath the earth surface featuring the ultimate cruelty impossible hope
 There's a tall tower carved out of the rock rising several stories to the surface blue skies visible when standing at its bottom looking straight up
 Presers are free to attempt climbing up and out and they do from time to time with the rope tied around their ways to catch them bungee
 Style before they fall off their death. There's a legend known to all the suffering prisoners passed from one generation to the next
 About the only person who ever succeeded is escape a child
 It is in this
 Subtraneal hell that a crippled Batman IE Bruce Wayne has been left to die after brutally difficult primitive managed rehab
 He attempts and fails and this escape not once but twice
 Now point of surrender an age prisoner who's befriended him tells him the secret of the child who did successfully clamor up the entire
 Tower and escape the child climbed without the rope the weight of the rope more of the embedded thought created by wearing the rope
 That one is gonna fall just enough burden to ensure failure the old man says that to have a chance you must climb without the rope
 This is a remarkable success parable buried deep in the film that few will notice most people try to achieve various lofty ambitions
 Perhaps the grace of which is freedom and autonomy while still dragging contrary conventions industry norms counterproductive beliefs lawful behaviors, etc
 Tied to them by a heavy rope the higher they try to climb the heavier the burden of the rope
 I first taught this in the early 1980s as a simplified cycle cybernetic concept in terms of the importance of a bountiful garden of pulling weeds
 Not just planting flowers. I'm often asked that to be super successful must have was my friends if your friends are unambitious or delusional or toxic
 Then yes, they must be left behind you must sever your ties to all the ordinary ideas and behaviors and business practices of the masses of the
 Majorities you must climb without the rope the Batman himself is a parable
 He is unlike most other costume superheroes as I pointed out before Superman is an alien from outer space
 And that is the source of a superhuman powers spider-man was bitten by a radioactive spider, etc
 Most superheroes come from a distant planet and are gifted powers by unworily beings the Green Lantern for example
 Our science experiments gone wrong or accidents like Spidey's if you have no superpowers at all
 But simply decided to make themselves into superheroes the Batman is a creature entirely of Bruce Wayne's decision
 If the genealogy of such things interests you the predecessor closest is the shadow
 Further the Batman made himself into a master detective and an extraordinary athlete martial artist fighter and an intimidating personality
 Anyway, there's probably a rope tied around your waist perhaps thin by you skinny as twine perhaps thicker and heavier than the huge rope tied to the
 Steamships angers you might want to pull on it and examine all this tied to the other end shedding dead way eases the speed of the journey
 Oh and the heaviest dead weights are never things or people their thoughts and beliefs. Oh, man
