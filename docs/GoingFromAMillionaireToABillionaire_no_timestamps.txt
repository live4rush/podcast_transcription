 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast
 We've got so many amazing questions and comments and things from you guys from last year episodes
 where I talked about me pausing my inner circle and
 It's funny
 we finished the last set of meetings last week and
 After I went home I played my kids and went out and had a good time
 And then that night I'd jump online just kind of see what's happening
 And what I didn't know was in the inner circle room paying June and a lot of you has no paying June
 He spoke it for my kid live two years ago
 and
 He did a Facebook live in the inner circle room talking about
 His kind of his perspective of me closing down the inner circle and I watched it twice now and I was like man
 It's it's really interesting like I don't know if I consciously
 Looked at through this lens initially, but like looking back at I'm like oh my gosh
 He's right and so it's all about the transition going from a millionaire to a billionaire and I wanted to share with you guys
 That message from paying June right now. So we're gonna cut to
 To to the intro and we come back you have a chance to hear from paying June
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out
 Of the world and yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody welcome back. Okay with that said I'm gonna queue up
 This clip from the Facebook live from paying June and one thing to note is that he's in the inner circle
 There's a whole lot of people talking the background
 There's music playing and so the quality is not gonna be the best at all
 But the message is super super important is understanding like for you to go from zero to million
 Like what is the thing you should be looking at and then to go from a million to a billion?
 What are the things you should be shifting and I think it was really powerful
 So I want to show us with you right now. So that said paying June take it away. It's our Facebook
 wanted to show you behind the scenes to
 What a 50k per year mastermind looks like so this is at end of
 Russell Brunson's inner circle
 Very very blessed and grateful to be part of this group for the last five years
 So I wanted to share with you guys like what it looks like what my biggest takeaways are but basically
 This is a super high end mastermind. It is 50k a year and
 One of the things that I feel so
 Like I feel I have to share it with you right now is
 What my biggest takeaways were
 And the answer will probably surprise you okay, so for those of you
 that've been following my journey you will know that
 I'm big on learning right big on growth, but the problem is that I
 Hate reading books because I'm a poor reader. Here's my biggest takeaway, okay?
 Let's just say there are a ton of changes that's happening in this community
 A lot of things that I can't say yet because it's not public, but I'll review what I can say
 to share with you
 What the biggest takeaways were okay, so usually how mastermind works if you're unfamiliar with like the structure is that that will be
 the entire
 Group of like-minded entrepreneurs just like them
 They're all minimum running a million dollar business
 and
 They're all crushing it in their respective industries that we just come together and talk about and share different strategies
 That's currently working for us and like for me
 The my source of growth today is no longer just
 I can't get it from books anymore. It's not from YouTube videos
 It is not from attending the seminars and workshops have probably been to like all of them back in the day in my pursuit of
 growth
 So my next level of learning is from other entrepreneurs and practitioners and people. It's actually doing it
 and
 So what was my biggest takeaway? Okay now many a lot of things that they talked about
 Rangers from tactics ranges to they talk about different strategies, but ultimately
 What was huge for me?
 is just
 Seeing how
 Some of them think and how they're constantly playing a bigger game and to kind of share with you
 Something that is public well, it is going to be public is that
 This inner circle is going to be placed on pause for a while
 Indefinitely there's no current plan to
 We don't know when it's gonna be back next but the and there are many different reasons why Russell's doing that
 But here's my first big takeaway
 Okay, this and you're gonna see how this can be applied for you as well as it's this so like I said inner circle is
 $50,000 a year and
 There are a hundred entrepreneurs. That's crushing it in this door all of it all of them here
 They're all crushing it. They're up. We're just about to leave for dinner
 But if you do the math, okay now to be part of this mastermind and as part of this mastermind
 You do the math behind it 50k a person times a hundred that is a
 $5 million per year revenue stream
 That Russell is saying no team and denying and you know what?
 What is required to fulfill this it's basically two-week ups a year that is two days each
 Can you imagine the level you got to be at to say no to five million dollars per year of free money?
 It's four days where
 We are pretty much doing the work point. How about the my world is we take turns we go on this stage we present
 Russell speaks for like one hour, but in order to operate at that level
 That blew my mind. It's like
 So here's the first big takeaway this again. I
 believe that in order to go from zero to a
 Million dollars maybe six figures
 It is about saying yes. It is not saying yes to life
 to opportunities to
 chances
 To take the leap of faith
 to take risks
 Because you you don't know what you don't know just yet
 However, and that's a starting part however to scale
 From seven to eight
 And now eight to nine for Russell well nine to ten Russell's click funnels
 They did over a hundred million dollars in sales last year
 Going from a millionaire to a billionaire
 Then it's all about saying no
 And it's just so apparent
 When I am seeing this entire thing here
 That that's the focus for Russell to say no to
 Five million dollars per year
 Of free money like literally three money
 We have a great time
 He doesn't have to prepare
 the people in the masterminds doing the work for him and
 For him to say no to that just goes to show
 focus
 It goes to show that
 From being a millionaire to a billionaire then it's about saying no to 99% of opportunities
 So how do you relate this back to what it is you're doing just think about right now your journey?
 Because the start of the journey is all about saying yes. It's about taking a chances taking the risks
 Saying yes to opportunities doing a thing that's scary for you even if you don't know how to do it just yet
 Saying yes to meeting a new person saying yes to taking on and going on that podcast saying yes to
 doing that Facebook video that YouTube and just taking on
 Potential opportunities because you just don't know what you don't know
 But after that in order to scale
 When you have something going then it's about focusing and then it is about
 saying no to pretty much
 99% of things
