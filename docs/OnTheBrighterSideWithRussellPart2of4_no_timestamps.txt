 Hey everyone, it's Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the Marketing Secrets Podcast. I hope you enjoyed the first part of our series
 yesterday, which was the first half of my interview with Monica Tanner on from the brighter side interview.
 And so
 Today we're basically gonna queue up the second half and then tomorrow
 On or not tomorrow with the next episode. You have a chance to listen to my better half
 And have Kletch tell her side of the story. So I'm excited for that
 So that's that and the cube of theme song and they listen to the exciting conclusion of my interview with Monica Tanner
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet
 Still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 So I'm sure several of my listeners would love to do something
 Amazing like like I try to talk a lot about finding your life's purpose
 And I know that so many of my listeners out there like I want to do it like I maybe I even they found their purpose
 But they're so afraid that it will require doing something uncomfortable or really far out of their comfort zone
 So what advice do you have for them to just kind of put that aside and be like this is my mission
 This is what I have to do even if I'm definitely afraid
 The good news is we're all afraid and you're not gonna be afraid at first
 So this is my big thing I believe so I'm for everybody with you're trying to find your life mission your purpose
 Whatever it is right a lot of times like even if we haven't achieved it yet
 We know like this is where I'm going right and we have like this goal
 I was picture like there's a mountain and on top of mount
 There's this result we want to get like that's that's where I'm going so I'm going this direction to try to go up there
 Right, but most of us aren't there yet and the biggest fear
 I see with people who are trying to like actually change the world is they're always like okay
 Well when I get to when I get there then I'll then I'll be able to do stuff
 And it's like the promise you never get there like it's like the horizon line right he's close to get the horizon the further
 It's a way you never actually get to the end and so I think the biggest thing is just starting like starting and that's the scary thing
 Because we're like we're not ready to start so one of my friends Gary Vaynerchuk
 He he said something was really profound one time
 He said a lot of people will go out there and trying to like create content to do whatever they're trying to do
 It's like don't create content like he said figure out where you're going and document the journey
 I was like oh my gosh
 This is I get my mind for a couple reasons
 So one of them is after my whole business collapsed and crashed and I was like the worst possible time start telling my story
 I was when I started my podcast and I remember I was like so part of who's like why am I doing this like
 I'm a failure in business. Why am I starting a business podcast right like I'm the worst person
 But but I was like I'm gonna start it now because like I because I think I even though I failed like I know something
 Other people haven't so many I can start sharing some stuff that some may someone's gonna start helping with so
 My creative podcast someone where I told you to do what you're doing, which is so cool
 I was totally gonna point that out
 I was gonna say you sat on my couch and you said just do it and I'm like but I don't know what to talk about
 And you're like it doesn't matter just start talking you'll find your voice and I was like okay
 I'm gonna do it and we're on episode 16. It's amazing. You're doing it
 It's crazy because for me so I knew that I went like I didn't have a microphone anything I got started
 So I just grabbed my phone
 I just record it while I was driving it's my first podcast is called marketing your car and it's literally me driving to the office
 Because we've gone from a 20,000 square foot office to this 2,000 square foot one and a format commute
 So it's like a foreign exam is gonna talk about what I'm praying will work today because everything has been working
 And so I would do that every single day
 I'd do it probably three times a week and I'd publish it and I didn't luckily
 I didn't know the time how to check podcast stats
 I had no idea if anyone's listening and I found out later
 No, big was for a long time for a couple years
 But I was doing it three times a week and it's been about five years now since I since I first launched the podcast and now
 You know how we get tons of downloads, but for a long time we didn't get any and but it was me documenting this journey
 What's cool about now is like now people find out about me like oh Russell
 But this huge company called click funnels and they hear like the big result we've done
 But what's crazy is that people don't connect with me like oh Russell's built this huge company like they it's almost hard to connect with people
 And they when you actually have reached gotten the result myself be like we'll go start my podcast go start episode number one
 This is like we barely didn't go we almost went through bank first we didn't and then I documented last five and a half years
 How we got here so start listening there you'll hear everything I learned along the way in the frustrations
 And in the whole journey you guys can come on this this thing with me and what people tell me is they log in and they they start the first
 One they like to say yeah
 I went and I binge listen to like like five years of your life
 And they it's funny because they'll come in to tell me these stories
 I'm like oh I forgot about that like five years ago
 But they binge listen everything and also now they're connected to me and now they care about the results
 They've heard about the downs so they care about the ups when people only hear about the ups
 They don't care about about you you're doing so I think for everyone I would say if you're listening right now like you start documenting your journey
 There's different ways to do it. I always ask people like whoever's listening like how many guys who are listening consider yourself a writer
 Like you like to write stuff
 Okay, if you're right or you should start a blog and like you should like be blogging two or three times a week
 Just telling your journey
 You moving towards some result you're trying to get if you like talking then you should do a podcast and just do like this like
 Interviewing people are telling you on story or both and and document journey that way or the 30th like video
 Which is my platform I the most comfortable nowadays is like turn on video camera and videotape yourself or do a Facebook live
 Instagram or just talk and you like by you documenting the journey of you trying to get the result
 That's how you find your voice
 That's how you start people will start coming to you and they when you start putting it out there
 Because the first they don't and first is small and but if you keep doing it eventually you get better and better
 In fact, I had one of my buddies who went binge listen to the whole podcast. He was like yeah your first like
 43 44 episodes were really bad. He's like about 45 ish
 You start like start like clicking and he's like now. It's like you're awesome
 You found your voice you forget your stories, but took me 45 episodes to get there
 I like if I were to stop after 16 or 20 like I never would have got here and all the people are able to pack down
 We never would have heard the message
 So for all you guys just like do it even though no one's in fact
 I think a lot of times we nervous because like oh no one's even gonna hear it
 But that should be comforting because at first you're gonna probably not be very good
 So like that's okay like do it now and when no one's listening as you're learning it
 It's not about them reading or hearing your thing at first
 It's about you finding your voice and after you found your voice that people will come they always do yeah
 That's funny because I listened to all the courses by like John Lee do a miss
 all the ones you tell me to listen to and they all say you have like 15 to 20 episodes
 I'm like I'm getting so close to that
 I hope I haven't figured out like at least I'm pressing record
 So in all of your travel travels who's the coolest or most influential person you've ever met?
 I definitely have to say for both cools and influential be Tony Robbins
 Tony's just like Tony's he's not a member of our church
 She's not but I felt the spirit more with Tony than probably anybody else
 Which from the spiritual side is amazing
 But I also look at him and he's someone who works with people from all around the world
 Like you see him working with the Dolly Vama all the way down to like people who are suicidal like you see this this contrast
 And he's someone who when you see me in public it's hard to know because you know on stage
 And he's like there's no one better stage president than Tony in the world like he's just amazing
 They seem like the intimate spots where he wouldn't have he could be super congruent because like nobody else is around
 He's still like this super congruent person who like is just obsessed with helping other people and to see someone who's done that
 at such a high scale and helps so many so many people and we were at one of his events and
 It's a big van he just twice a year and and he asked over there
 I'd say who here is suicidal and there's probably 40 50 people raise their hands
 He sat there for like 20 something hours going person by person like fixing them reprogramming their brain and you watch it over and over and over again
 That's suicide the next day is like relationships and thing and thing and just like it's it's amazing
 See someone like that who cares so much and has built such a big platform that they can actually have because we're amazing people everywhere
 But someone who's built a platform and do it that wide of a scale and still be like a good human being is rare
 And so yeah, he's he's amazing
 That's so cool and who of all of the entrepreneurs that you've ever worked with who's been your favorite or most memorable
 Oh, man, that's probably a tough question. I was like
 There's so I
 Have obsessed non-preneurs. They're so amazing
 I would say probably the one that be top of mind right now is just because I've seen them
 They've made a lot of money like insane amounts of money, but like for them
 It's not about money like they're so big on impact
 So it's a it's a young couple Brandon and Kaitlyn Poland and they they're 24 25 years old right now and
 Three years ago they came to our world they they were they'd been like a marketing opportunity to kind of collapse on them
 And so they came in like completely broke and remember they sent me a video like the very first day they found out about us
 It was like hey Russell like we're Brandon Kaitlyn and we're gonna be your biggest success story ever and I get those sometimes
 I was like oh good luck
 You know I'm and and that's all I heard and then it's funny now that I know I heard the story afterwards
 They're like completely broke had no money newlywed couple right and so they went and we were selling this course
 There was a thousand bucks, which I think they the bank out of time was like there was no money
 They only just credit lines all they had and they went and they watched this webinar
 I did and Kaitlyn was like you got to buy this and Brandon was like
 I don't dare to so he was supposed to go buy it and he went out and instead just bought like this like a lower thing
 We sold like a hundred bucks and she found out she got so mad she went in she went and bought it and so it ended
 Costing $1,100 of a hundred but they were like we have to make this work like our entire life depends on this and so they went
 Open of the course they pushed play and they watched what they paused it and whatever I said they just okay
 We're just gonna do this exactly like Russell said she actually coined the through the hashtag
 Do what Russell says down all our events everyone's like hashtag do it Russell says but she's like everything says we're just gonna do it perfectly
 And I've never met somebody that just executed better than them
 They watch it pause do it come back do it and they went to do the entire course that way
 And on the back they launched this company called lady boss weight loss
 Which you know I'm sure some of your listeners probably heard of is blown up into they've helped over a hundred thousand women last three years
 The successfully was weight they built a culture they built a brand
 They're launching supplements now at our last event
 They got a they got a big award for making over $10 million in the funnel
 But the most amazing thing is just like the impact like I see because I'm in I'm like the only man in there
 Because for his weight loss program for women, so I'm like the only man in their groups like just kind of watching
 You know cuz I want there people know but I'm watching what's happening
 I'm looking at these at these transformations and how many people's lives that they're they're affecting and they're changing
 It's just like you just nothing. It's been more exciting than seeing what an entrepreneur can do
 Actually heard you speak about them and I I'm like gonna look them up right there amazing
 So for those of us who are just at the beginning of our entrepreneurial journey
 What is the most important piece of advice you would offer us like what's the most one thing? I think the most important thing
 The thing the most entrepreneurs do that's wrong is they get obsessed with like a product like I create this product
 I found this thing or like they get obsessed with the product and when you get obsessed with the product
 It's it's hard to have success and it's hard to have impact what I recommend ever do is you get obsessed with the person
 Like a business is not about selling a product a business is about giving somebody a result
 So I always think about like hey in fact if you read the doc up my first book
 I wrote I talk about how like after a bankrupt and we're trying to rebuild our business like I just I had this chance like
 Who was my dream customer like if I could pick one person to serve words like if I could hang out them every day and just like help
 Him become better who would that be and I spent a lot of time like insane amounts on thinking about that question like who isn't
 And in fact I went to Google and I typed in like I want six people who are successful people who used to be athletes people
 Who have made a whole list of stuff and I went to Google images
 I typed all those things in and then I typed in man and I found all shows all these faces of people and there was this guy
 And I don't know who I have no to who actually is but I saw his face
 I was like that's my dream customer so I took that Google image
 I printed out and I framed it on my desk like this is the man
 I want to serve and I went and I typed in a woman's name
 I typed in I think was Julie and she's successful and she's got a couple kids
 And I kind of explained like my dream person and I went to Google images and I typed all that in and I saw this person
 I was like that's Julie
 I don't know who her real name is in her life
 That's Julie I printed her out and I had her on the desk and I would just look at everything
 I was like hey like that's who I want to serve I want to serve Mike and Julie and then I started thinking okay
 Like this is Mike and Julie and because I wrote like this list of who like who they wore and everything
 I was like what do they actually care about what do they want that that's the question I started asking myself
 And I was like okay now what can I create how can I actually serve them like what would I if I really care about their success
 Like what would I do what I create what would it look like and how and it shifts in my mind from like creating products
 So like how do I serve those guys and then from that then the product I just started coming out and they just are and it's crazy
 The very first thing I first product we created afterwards
 I get attracted the mics and the julies like it was like perfect bait
 They got those people in because we crafted to try to try to to try to serve them right it was crazy
 We did that we ran that product for a while and then at the back end of it
 We did an event we had about a hundred or so people came to Boise for that event
 It was crazy was like 30% women 70% men. I told them an issue
 I said hey guys, I'm gonna tell you some cool
 I learned like I wanted to to get the right people and I said how many of you guys does for the men in the room?
 How many do these characteristics
 Tell you like you used to be an athlete you've had success in the past you want to impact more and I listed through the things
 I heard some hands went up and I showed a picture of Mike
 I was like you guys are all mics and I said how many of you guys how many of the women here are this and I did
 Everyone to the women like and afterwards women came to be like I'm your Julie
 And I was like I know because we crafted it from that point forward
 And so if I think for every entrepreneur it's becoming hyper focused on like customer the customer avatar
 What everyone called that you're like you want to become obsessed with it
 Like you could wake up every morning and just know like if I'm serving that person like it's gonna be the best time in the world
 And that's like that's where you start and then the products everything else will come after that
 It's just figuring out the person that you're so that you would just go crazy to be able to serve and then
 Starting there and then everything amazing we're on the back of that
 Okay, I have my avatar list so I'm working on it cool. I'm working on
 All right, I'm gonna get a little personal with you
 You have five amazing kids and you're an incredible dad in fact
 My very favorite thing is I drive your daughter in carpool
 And so I love when I drop her off and sometimes it's late at night
 And you're just in the doorway and you're carrying Nora and I think oh my goodness like there he is
 He's just being the dad like you know he's done working for the day and his most important priority as his kids
 I love that about you. You're definitely a family man
 But if there's one thing you want your kids to learn from you or know that you stand for what is that one thing?
 Man, it's interesting. Before I answer it's been on my my life. I've started working with Chris and Krispies Cancer.com
 I always think like if I was to get cancer like what would be the very first thing I would do every time I think about it
 I know the first thing I would do is I grab my kids like every video camera
 I would try to record like what I would tell them right now
 So I could like so when I died I could watch it later and be like oh my dad told
 This is the advice my dad gave me and I had someone actually two days ago
 And then I was at that that talked about that and I was like, you know
 Why why should I wait till I have cancer?
 That's all my list this week of things to do is to go with each kid sit down or actually cord like my advice
 Then I want to try to like once a year and just have an archive so that someday
 They can have it be super cool to have a great idea
 So yeah tonight tonight kids listen in so and it's tough because I think about that like there's different aspects
 There's like the spirits like what would I give them spiritually? What would I give them socially?
 What would I give them financially? What would be the what would be the advice?
 But I think the thing that's helped me have the most success in all aspects of life is
 I've been really big and then this is some I learned initially from Tony Robbins
 Which is probably one reason I like him so much
 But is finding people that are the opinion of what you want to become and then and then modeling them as close as you can
 That's that it fits in everything right?
 So if you're if you're spiritually like who are the people spiritually look at they're like man
 I want to be like that person and then and then like model them as close you can figure out like what they do
 How they do it like I'm so obsessed with like I interview people all the time like what's your morning your team?
 What do you do the first thing you do the morning like what do you because I want to know like what they're doing to get them to get that
 Outcome right like everything is like people don't just wake up one day amazing
 like there's a bunch of things they do that get them to be that way and so I think that'd be a big part and
 Even so much so they're like if it was if it was like from a financial or business section
 I'll be like find that person you want to be like and go like move in with them work time for free
 Whatever you need to do like to figure that person out because yeah
 Everything I've been successful life came from that I was like finding something is amazing and then just following them and like
 Leaving them and 100% like putting all my eggs in that basket and just and whatever it can I think that'd be the biggest thing
 Good role models and then and then modeling them like obsessively modeling not just like oh this person's awesome
 I like that person like no like obsessed like like get into their mindset like they written books like read all the books like listen
 Their podcast like get inside their mind like why do they think that way because if you figure out why they think that way
 It's gonna help you to figure out like how you should be thinking right. Yeah, so obsessively modeling models
 What if they let you down you gotta keep your anchor and the one perfect maybe that's the role modeled in
 So one of my favorite things about you and your family is how down to earth and normal you are what is it that keeps you so
 Humble and grounded when people literally pay thousands of dollars to hear what you have to say I
 Think part I'm gonna give clet so much credit for this a huge part of my wife
 My wife doesn't care about any of this stuff which is tough for me because it's like as a man like 99
 So the reason why I do this is try to impress her and she's just like I'm good
 Like you just come home like I just want you come home, you know and I think it's a big part of it
 I think a second part we kind of touched upon earlier just
 Because I've cycled twice and because I've built it and lost it all at a really deep painful level like I am
 Completely like I am hyper hyper hyper where the fact that this is not me
 There's so many people and experiences and things that have made this possible
 And if I'm not really careful that can be taken away instantly anyway
 I have such belief in my in my role in this world in this life that's like everything that I've been given
 I've been given it was not something that I it's not mine
 And so I'm very aware of that and scare that and then just the fact that you know my wife
 She's amazing and like just knowing that like I don't know
 I think if if I if I if I'm not careful, I think I could lose her and my family and for me
 It's like that's there's a quote David on the case said there's no success can compensate for failure in the home
 I think about all the time like God like I gotta get home cuz like if I fail there then I feel everything like that's my
 My big mindset. I always think like my wife was to leave me like I means I I failed this life like I know
 It's not true
 There's and I never say that because there's so many people I love they've gone through divorces and things
 And that's not what I'm saying
 But I just know repursting in my mind said like if that if that was to happen like that would be ultimate failure for me
 So because that's like I got to be very careful because I know I have so many people that I love that I respect that
 Especially in business we get so obsessed with it that they lose everything and I and I think I definitely have 10
 industries to do that if I'm out really really careful
 So I just try to be because I get obsessed with things and I I could go to the office and spend like six months there and forget about
 The world and if it wasn't for like my beautiful wife and these amazing kids that were like I gotta go home
 Like it wasn't for that like I you know, I could be in trouble
 So I don't know it's it's a family and then just knowing being hyper aware. It's not me
 I love that I love that you credit Collette cuz she could care less what you drive or what you wear or how much you can
 Bench she doesn't care any of that. I can't figure it out
 She loves to go to your wrestler
 Alright, what are you most grateful for and how are you giving back? I know you are I know the answer to this question
 But I want you to tell my listeners. I know that you every weekend you teach the little neighborhood kids
 How to wrestle and you do that totally free because you love it. I love that you do that. Yeah, actually cool things
 I don't know
 I think I just look at like the the different gifts I've been given like I'm this part of my life
 I'm like hyper where I okay, why was I given that there's not wrestling is one right like I wasn't I didn't learn wrestling just
 Like as much fun as I have much I love that. Why was I given that gift?
 Okay, there's a reason it wasn't just like be fun for me like initially probably was but like long-term
 It's like you're giving gifts
 It's like the whole progression of life's interesting if you look at it right like there's a time life where we go through this growth phase
 Right, we're like and like as babies
 That's where our babies come out and sell out growth right and all the time figure things out and then eventually you you stop growing until you shift
 To to contribution so it's like it's ending in a marriage right first it first is just you and then you meet your spouse
 I'm so it's like oh my gosh
 There's a person you care about them and all since like your whole world becomes us as opposed to me and you come less selfish
 And it's like now we're together and then also you have these amazing kids and it shifts again from like ways us to like this
 Them and like they're the most important thing right so for me my life
 It's like there's this huge parallel like being being single to being married being kids
 That's happening in everything right so like I was wrestling was growth
 I was trying to become a better wrestler for me
 But it's like okay now I have this this thing that this gift I was given like what's the point of it?
 It's like oh I'm still contribute so we're gonna contribute like well
 I can help my kids I can help the neighborhood kids like if I can bring wrestling to them like it gave me so many gifts like
 Let me do anything any kid who's interested like let me just help serve there
 The same thing is some other organizations we work with
 There's a charity called World Teacher Aid that builds schools in Kenya that we we work with there's also operation
 We're going real world that saves kids from sex slavery like I don't have the ability to go and save kids from sex slavery
 I don't I'm scared of that like the whole mission these guys that go to Haiti and go these countries around the world
 And they go and they they rescue kids and say like I don't have the ability to do that
 Right, but if I can help over here like the gifts
 I have been given if I can get the message out to more people and if I can make more awareness if I can raise money for them
 Like that's so exciting because it's like I can help impact that thing without having to do the thing
 It's super scary, right?
 And so it's like for me
 It's like using these gifts I've been given like oh I'm trying to get more and more folks like why would why would
 Did God give me that gift because it's not just so I could I don't think it was any gifts for us
 It's like how do we now use for the people so for me?
 It's just kind of figuring that out like what like why was I given this and then now I've got it okay
 What what do you want me to do with this because you know what's the purpose of it?
 Yeah, I love that. I think he gave you the gift of determination. I'm learning that
 I'm like you are one determined
 So all of your accomplishments, what are you the most proud of?
 Oh, man, I'm sure exactly the best for answers one
 I think like I feel like my like I'm supposed to be helping people to the work
 He's my head like freedom. I how do I free people so they can actually do what they need to do?
 You know I mean like and I feel like that's probably the most
 Important thing like if I can give people tools or ideas or thoughts or permission to like free themselves people are amazing
 I wonder if I can help me a little bit with this
 Like I feel like like I remember once we were talking and you're like money is not a bad thing like
 It's not a bad thing to make money change your mindset a little bit
 And I thought about and as I think about that more
 I think money making money is amazing because it gives you so much freedom
 So the more money that you have like I want my kids to be hard workers
 I want them to learn how to make a lot of money because for us
 I know for my husband and I it's given him a lot of freedom to be able to coach the neighborhood
 Kids and soccer and it's given him the freedom to be at home with his family and make memories with us
 And it's given us the chance to give back a lot
 And so I think whatever your focus is with money is what you'll do
 So if you value boats and homes and all those things none of those things
 I'm not saying any of them are bad
 But if that's what your focus is that's what you're gonna spend your money on
 but if you believe in making a difference and you know changing the world somehow giving your money and your time
 To worthy causes then that being able to do that frees you up so much to do that
 And I see you doing that for people you're taking people who are kind of you know working paycheck to paycheck and just kind of slaves to
 You know their circumstances to being able to like be the captain of their own ship like they're making their money
 They're making their difference and I think that's so cool. That's cool. They think about even like you're like Mazlob's hierarchy of needs
 I remember this in school. I don't remember all the details
 But I remember like the bottom is like you have to have food and water routes
 You can't focus anything else and when food water is covered
 They're like oh, and then we just shelter and shelter covered and you need that's the thing
 I would all you're starving to death
 You can't all you can think about is that and it's like I feel like may someone that in the hierarchy needs
 There's something where we need financial security, right?
 It's like we can give people that then they don't have to be stressed about how might where's my food coming from my paycheck?
 Like how am I doing that if I get that stress goes away then yes
 Then they can like look outwardly and like how can I bless other people's lives?
 And that's that's really really cool. So yes, you you said that perfectly way better than I did
 All right
 What is your number one key to success? How did you become Russell Bronson?
 Man, I think I came down to termination you talked about earlier like and belief
 I think beliefs the biggest thing
 I think I was blessed like I think about wrestling. Well, I was successful in wrestling
 I think I remember going to the state tournament and seeing a guy win the state title
 And I was like I believe that I can do that and so what out there?
 And I just killed myself until I did it with business like I was not a business major
 I didn't know business anything
 I got online and I was trying to figure out to make money
 And I saw these people and like I saw what they're doing and I had so much belief that like they're doing it
 So I can do it and so I just did it and I kind of like seems I believed it was awesome
 I still remember like when the whole company bankrupting around the everything's falling apart and one of my best friends this day
 Came into me Brent Co. Peters and he said he's like hey, so everything looks really scary
