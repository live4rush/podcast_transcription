 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast today you are ready and prepared I hope for
 Part three of a four-part series where I had a chance to interview with my very first mentor mark joiner
 And what's cool about this is in the past?
 I've had a chance to interview mark a lot of times
 But it was the first time that he ever interviewed me which was kind of
 Anyway, it was a huge honor to have your mentor asking you questions about stuff and so like I said in the first episode
 Mark was my very first mentor online someone who I
 Man have so much respect for so grateful for him and his his contribution that helped me to figure this game out
 And I hope you guys enjoy part three of our four-part series with my very first ever mentor mark joiner
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Okay, third thing third thing third thing alright, so
 I think the reason why a lot of people is they're trying to grow the company that you hit these ceilings like I
 I struggled this like I I got stuck between one and three million dollars a year if I could deck you like I couldn't break
 That ceiling about how hard I did and what I realized is as long as click funnels the first phase of the business was like
 There's like the hyperactive cut like the first set of customers were the easy ones right like they just they get it
 The early adopters they figure stuff out and those are like the customers are already there
 They're just waiting for you to go and grab them and I think most companies
 That's as far as they ever get in fact I've been geeking out on the book crossing the chasm right now
 And there's like those five different things right
 And it's like the innovators the first ones
 I think that's where most people's businesses get to the innovators and that's that's the way stop right I
 That game phase is like the early adopters, but these people aren't
 Like you have to start the second phase you have to learn how to like create a customer right like
 Like we've again first launch click funnels like the internet marketers who knew what funnels were like sweet
 I mean and they came in they got click funnels early adopters right but then there's after that was done like
 Like we ran out it was like the inner Ferrari on a dead-end road like we ran out of road and also like hey
 We got all the internet marketers like oh crap now what and it was like okay now
 We have to create customers like we have to change our messaging create our friend and price like they do things so that when someone comes
 They they don't come with the desire ahead of time
 They listen to the message and all since like oh I need a funnel like if you look at even strategically the dot-com
 Secrets book was to get the early adopters people registered funnels were like here's like how here's my strategy of funnels
 We got them in and an expert secrets was like hey
 Do you have talent like are you good at do you have ideas or or advice or things you can make money with right?
 You can share your advice like like people like oh yeah
 I do it's like cool
 Well, you need a funnel to be able to get that message out to the marketplace and so we we created customers
 From you know from from these from people and that's kind of the second phase
 And I don't think most people ever get to that where they're in the the phase of creating customers
 They're getting the low-hanging fruit early adopters and then that's the business and they hit the ceiling and never get past it
 And it's realizing the next phase is like okay. How do I create customers how to create the desire so that they they will come from
 Where they are and come to the next phase and I feel like just for my standpoint
 Like we just finished like we're kind of at the end of the early adopter phase
 And we're now making the leap to like the early majority
 Which is which for me?
 This is like the big my big challenge is crossing the chasm we talk about later if we want it
 But like that's the next phase that I'm in and most people never you know taking us six years to get the point
 We're done with that phase and moving to across the chasm, which is scary
 That's kind of what I want to end on actually
 I want to interview quick here
 This is a very interesting Eugene Schwartz lesson that I think is quite apropos to what you're talking about and you remember
 You know the audience awareness scale, right?
 You know, so he's got two things in there the you know the audience sophistication scale the audience awareness level and the audience awareness level
 Goes all the way from like problem unaware, right? So actually should put yet so problem unaware
 So imagine, you know, you got a guy who is living in the Aboriginal bush
 And he doesn't even know that there is such a thing as phones and you're like hey
 Here's an iPhone well
 He's not even aware that he has the problem that he doesn't have a phone
 Right and then you got guys who are problem aware and then you got solution aware and then it goes all the way up to
 Most aware right which is like a guy who's like hey
 All you have to do is tell me that there's the new iPhone coming out
 I'm in
 I'm camping out
 Like I'm gonna be in front of the iPhone store for two weeks. So I can be first right
 So as Russell was was changing he was dealing with guys who were you know sort of like, you know
 solution aware and sometimes even problem aware
 But as he was expanding his marketplace
 He had to kind of reach out to these other areas
 But what you have to also understand is that as you go across this whole spectrum
 This area is almost always where the biggest money is but it's the hardest market to talk to
 Because the messaging is so much more
 Yeah, the best day like
 each
 Step in that like it's because people like well, how do you shift it like it's it's the words?
 It's like the language. I remember Dean grassy was to call me one day. He's like this is the weirdest thing
 It's like I'm at my wife's hairdresser and hairdresser talking about this thing called click funnels
 And he's like calls me's like you've done some no one else has ever done because my hairdresser is talking about your company right now
 But it's like again if I walk to hairdresser like you want a funnel that I for my hair
 Like how does that work?
 It's like no way we had to speak differently to those audiences and as we go further out to different audiences
 We change our language patterns because we're to speak to them in a way that they understand and then we and then we bridge the gap
 Right that we take them through a bridge that helps them understand like oh that that means funnel
 And this is why you need that thing and that's right so much
 So you're not even gonna know what a funnel is. Yeah, exactly exactly
 By the way another really interesting book people can read so sort of like a spiritual sequel to break to advertising was one written by
 You know some of the guys high level in a gora called great leads and they talk about
 Yeah, it's actually a fantastic book
 And it shows you six different ways to talk about those different audience to talk to those different audience awareness levels
 Very very good read for people
 Okay, now so this one is so I know I want to get into your to the thing that you talk about about crossing the chasm
 And I think that's a nice one to end on here
 And actually because I wrote it is your plan to reach the billion dollar level and I think that's kind of the same question really
 Right, so but before we get to that I want to ask you what your three biggest
 personal lessons were in this journey in this
 Entrepreneurial journey and you can even talk about some of your sports stuff, too
 Because I know some of that applies
 Yeah, so what would you say those are?
 Man, I would say to begin with is like
 Entrepreneurship like building a business is like the best personal development seven or are you ever going to like
 Like shove in your face and it gets bigger and bigger is like
 And you deal with it or you go broke
 Oh, yeah, it's it's it's tough
 Um, but what's cool about business, too
 It's kind of like I have a lot of friends who are having the first baby right now
 And I remember our first babies came and we got five kids now
 But when the first come you're still scared like what am I gonna do the baby shows up?
 You're freaking out awesome the baby comes out and sits there it sleeps for 18 hours a day. You're like, oh
 Just sitting there like okay, it's not bad
 You know and then it starts growing and growing and and what's interesting is that your capacity
 To handle a baby grows as a baby grows right?
 So right now i've got my twins are 14 years old and it's like man they stress us out teenagers are so much harder
 But it's like yeah, they came out if they would have came out at 14 year olds like it would have crushed us
 We've been destroyed because we weren't prepared right but but they are capacity to handle the problems grew as
 As um as the kids grew and I think you know I look at like the stuff I deal with on a daily basis right now like
 Six years ago would have destroyed me like i'm so grateful that
 You know that I had six years to grow in capacity to handle the stuff like I mean it's it's ridiculous
 But that's why business is so much fun too and it's exciting so um
 What was the question again?
 Also the three biggest personal lessons that you've learned along the way
 And again, this could be from your sports career from your parenting and from your entrepreneurial journey because I think they're all related
 As you said, you know business is the best personal development seminar you could possibly attend these things are not unrelated
 They are all
 It's it's all one life right, you know and things that I learned in the military definitely applied
 You know to my life of business and i'm sure things that you learn in the sporting world and in parenting have also
 Applied to business as well
 So so so it sounds like the first one is is that you had to learn how to grow
 Along with the challenges because the the challenges are not going to get easier
 They're actually by definition in life going to get more difficult and I think what let's just be really
 Frank and blunt with everybody listening look we all age people we all age
 That means that baked in to the formula for life itself is increasing difficulty
 No matter what and if you think you're going to insulate yourself in some bubble
 You know everybody has this they get an entrepreneurialism saying well
 What what's going to happen is is i'm going to make a whole bunch of money
 That i'm going to sit on a beach slip an umbrella drinks and all my problems are going to go away
 Well, guess what's going to happen you do that and I I tried there. Here's what happened
 I got fat sick and and and it was and I became this this horrible
 Disgusting person that I was not proud of and I was going to die if I carried on with that path
 This is the way the universe is designed guys. It's designed to continue to get more difficult and to challenge you more
 Would you would you agree with that 100% unless you unless and some people not because they like
 They cave and they go and they sit watch tv and they just like i'm going to tap out and sedate themselves to to like to
 So they don't hear the you know the voice the calling river is it's like pulling you right because I think I think all humans have that
 I think it's inherent from our creator that like there's this thing that like pulls us to want to do more and like
 We wanted to attribute and like we have this thing
 and um
 But the majority people they they tries to date it right they say it with tv with drug alcohol with pornography
 It never does like to get that noise out because there's pain with that like like man. It is painful to walk out
 I'll tell a story that maybe this kind of ties into the second one but but um
 We were about a year into click funnels and
 And um, you know, this is all of our first rodeo like it was Todd's first time building an app this big and all these things and
 And I remember when we first built it. He's like he's like i'm pretty sure that like, you know the way I built it
 Will handle about 10,000 customers
 We thought maybe that would take you know a couple of years and then a year we're 10,000 customers and sure enough like
 About a year in like things start happening and like the site go down for half an hour
 And then like they get it back up and then like all these problems and all these these things and it was just like
 So much stress and I remember I got asked to speak in London on to talk about click fun
 So my wife my kids my family we flow fly to London
 As soon as we land at the airport I get out and I'm trying to get my phone connected and get a SIM card
 And whatever soon it gets in like my phone is just like like on fire from like and it's all these people who I knew and they
 I thought they were my friends, but soon but click phones went down and they were not like
 Like they want like pitch for throughout the array to kill me and I'm like I don't even happening and so I
 I remember I've messaged Todd and I'm like what happened. He's like we've been down for two hours
 He's like we can't figure out he's like if if we're able to recover from this then
 I don't know something but I was never saying if and I was like
 Wait, what was like when it was like if and I'm like, oh my gosh like I don't even know how to deal with this and like
 I've been there
 We're in a car and we're drinking kids the hotel and they're like all excited for in London
 And I'm like stressing out like I don't know what to do and finally get the hotel
 And we're talking and everything's still down on like facebook and like everyone's like like little death threats
 Like it's crazy. How crazy people get like and just do everywhere in it and
 And and all I wanted to do was like, you know, and I'm a Mormon. So there's not many things that we can do this today
 Like let's go get some ice cream
 What do we do?
 And uh remember that moment. I was just like I just want to hide but I was like I don't think that's the right
 I don't know. I don't think that's the right thing. I think I need to talk about this and I shouldn't like
 Act like it's okay because it's not like I get
 So I decided so I went to our facebook group at the time
 Like I think it's still archived and they probably find it
 But I did this video from the hotel room and I was like
 Click phones is down and it is not acceptable and I am pissed at myself. I'm pissed at my team or I'll piss
 Like like this is not okay. And like I just went out like all my sites are down. I'm losing money. You're losing money
 I understand it's not fair to you. It's not fair like and I just own it
 publicly
 live streaming and um
 And it was scary. I'm like, I don't know what's gonna happen
 I'm gonna keep you guys a prize, but we're doing everything we can and and I and it's not acceptable
 And I am so sorry and we're gonna fix this and and I just led with that and then and then got facebook live and I'd probably ball my eyes out
 Like I don't know if we're gonna fix this like
 You know and um and luckily I've got an amazing team back home
 And they're they're killing themselves. You know, it'll be a whole it'll be a good chapter in the bootstrap book someday
 But everything went on but I think about eight hours and they got it back up and I remember if I got back up then it was
 You know it got stable then then um we're just like oh no
 What's gonna be the the damage from this and the fallout and I remember um
 You know we get graphs every day of like how many people signed up and we will leave like just you know
 All those kind of numbers and and man during that little that thing like our number of cancellations almost non noticeable like like
 And I'm just like I can't like if we went the other way around and hid behind it
 I wouldn't trust like who knows how like what would happen
 um
 And that was just such a good learning moment for you like we can't hide behind stuff like in today's the world like we just have to come out from
 And and so like that was a year in and then luckily, you know
 From that point we had some other good partners who came on like ryan mon gum ray who came and like helped to stabilize things and
 Figure out all these things and and um, you know, it's it's been pretty stable since then but like it's just those things
 You know that that you learn of like don't hide like it's
 You know don't say and I think in all in all aspects of life. That's like a lesson like don't
 Like like as soon as the coming gets hard like man
 They're your brain's gonna be looking for a million different ways to say no or like I don't want to go that way
 No, no, no
 And like man everything good always comes from like going to the eye of the storm of pushing through it
 And uh, you know, even though the pain is like if I could fight the date or if I go if I check out
 Um, it's gonna be good, but it's it's not a it's not a way to live life
 Anyway
 So, you know, dude, it's funny you say that I was just shooting a video about exactly that about how everybody is kind of
 Oopiating themselves these days, you know through, you know, the the dopamine hits of social or you know, whatever it is
 I mean, you know, everybody's got their their drug of choice now, you know, again
 I mean, you know, you know, you're named a lot of them, you know binge washing pornography
 I mean, you know actual hardcore drugs. I mean there are people now there's so many people that are hooked on fentanyl
 And and heroin combinations and I mean it's just it's a really ugly cocktail
 Of what's going on and I want to kind of interject and maybe pause it what I think another third lesson is for you
 Let me I'm actually going to ask you a question. Were you raised in Mormonism or did you choose to convert?
 I was definitely raising it, but I also had a very definite like point where I chose it
 You know, there at least for me for I think there's always a time when storm comes and you gotta decide what you really believe
 Definitely had that so yes and yes
 And I would say I would just kind of hypothesize that that played a huge role in your personal development because you guys are not allowed
 To to involve yourselves in any of those sedation methodologies, you know, they encourage a very morally upright life
 And I have to say being you know a veteran of the military intelligence community
 I actually got to know a lot of Mormons because Mormons go out there and they get their language training as missionaries
 So there are a lot of Mormons in the military intelligence community
 And I gotta say like almost all of the Mormons that I worked with were really
 Solid dudes who were like just you know genuine
 Sincere people, you know who wanted to live their life correctly and you know and legitimately wanted to be kind to people
 And I know you've got people like bill mar out there, you know
 Saying all kinds of really nasty things about Mormonism, you know
 Pawn at a cult and stuff like that, but my experience with Mormons has been nothing but very positive
 And it would seem to me that that your choice
 To to really even though you were raised in it to to decide to take that on very seriously
 Must have also been very pivotal for you in your personal growth
 100% so I mean you think about like that
 I did go on a mission for two years for the church and like
 I won when I was 19 years old was just typically for most people that's the time when you're in college
 You're partying you're drinking you're like, I think all about yourself and you go out there and mission and like
 You can't do anything for yourself like you get a name tag where literally I was elder bunsome like my name is gone
 Like I'm not even a you know and and you're out there every serving other people during typically the most selfish time in someone's life
 And for two years that's the when you look at things when you come home
 Now we saw people like I'm so grateful. I made money after the mission because
 Who knows what would happen, you know like
 And we have we both have friends that made a lot of money really young and it destroyed them and so it's like
 Oh, yeah
 Definitely, you know, it's just super grateful that I had that lens to you know, just I don't know
 The lens of learning how to serve people before yourself, which is you know
 Unfortunately, most people don't have that opportunity and you know on a mission
 You're you're kind of forced into it and and um, you know, you learn to love it. So yeah
 Well, it's funny for me. I went through I mean I was you know, even though my family was catholic
 You know, I was kind of raised around atheist agnostics
 You know, I became you know to sort of what I would call now a pantheistic spiritualist
 But over time I have become more and more, you know rigid in that
 You know, I mean I've explored, you know all of the different world's religions
 And I mean I you know the one thing I haven't decided yet if i'm going to settle in any location
 I still need to listen to your you know, your your mornin apologetics
 Video that you made i'm super curious about that. I need to make a point of hearing it because I mean i'm open to it
 I'm open to it and when I see people who are living a life
 That represents, you know genuine service for other people like I don't know if you ever heard of this guy father gregory
 Who has this thing called homeboys bakery?
 And he was kidding and basically what he does he takes these kids
 who were
 You know, they were in prison and he gives them jobs at a bakery and then helps teach them how to be decent people
 And I saw that in med I kid
 I can't help but get choked up when you hear about something like that man
 Because when you hear when you see somebody live in their life that way
 And when you know what the cost of living your life the other way is
 It makes you really take those kind of things seriously and even though religion gets a bad rap because yeah, you know
 There's a lot of crazy stuff happening in organized religion
 The the notion that that sin, you know, how do you want to label that?
 Destroyers your life is an observable phenomenon, man
 I mean you can you can see it
 I mean when you do all of the things that you're you know
 Quote-unquote not supposed to do and all of the religions of the world tell you not to do a lot of the same things
 And when you see what happens to people who live their life that way and they think they can get away with it
 Right and then you see what happens to people who live there
 And I'm not and I'm talking about people who are you know, like the week
 Oh, I'm trying to be a nice guy as a way to manipulate people
 That's that's a bullshit thing that some people do right? I'm talking about guys who are like, hey
 I'm gonna make myself a strong person and I'm gonna do good in the world though when I see people like that
 I'm like that that is the path
 That we all need to be walking down and the more of us do that the better the world's gonna be yeah, I had someone
 recently told me that
 Like learn about like my beliefs and stuff and just but that must be really really hard
 And then I say now I looked at their life and I was like looking at the path they've they've gone on and not to judge them
 All but I'm like that seems so much harder like yeah, I don't know like
 Maybe but you know, I'm grateful for the path and I'm gonna stay on it
 So
 Good for you, man. Good for you, dude. I mean, I I'm
 I'm blessed to see your example because you know, you're yet another person I can look at and say, hey
 Here's a guy and your life is harder than mine, man
 Your company is you know doing way more volume than mine right now you have kids to manage
 You do all these extra things on top of it, you know, and I'm like man
 I want to I want to learn how Russell is managing all of this stuff
 You know what I mean because I mean you're younger than I am but you figured some things out that I haven't figured out
 I want to learn that and I'm a moron if I don't learn it right
 I mean, this is this is where the egolessness has to come in if you want to be better and better and better
 If you want to truly achieve greatness, you got to be really straight with yourself about what you can and can't do
 So let's let's kind of tie this up now with this crossing the chasm thing, man
 This is uh, you know, um, I don't know if this is something that could be covered
 Briefly because I imagine it's going to be a pretty complex thing, but what can you say about that?
 Yeah, and I'll play some of my thoughts. I don't know all the answers yet. Um, we're on the trip here now
 And it's it's fun though because it's like for me, um
 It's been interesting as I've gone on this journey too. Um, and maybe it's tied back to last question as well, but like
 um
 You know and I'll tie back sports like when I was wrestling for a long time like I was
 It was me. I was the all-star. I was out there wrestling. It was my thing at my hand raise
 I loved it and now that I'm older and I've got kids now like my kids wrestle and like
 It's it's hard the transition from like all-star to coach is really painful, right?
 Because it's like I want to be on the map like oh, there's anything's wrong and like and at first
 It's really painful and then eventually like for me my kids
 It's my there my twins 30 and wrestling and this she was like so rewarding because
 Except when we work on the finally getting and like to see them get their hand raise actually felt better than my own hand raise
 Which is weird because I was like that's been the green my life is getting my own hand raise
 And with business was similar because like the first two years of ClickFunnels like I was the all-star like
 Like people like how big was your funnel building team like it was me. I built the funnels
 I wrote a sales president like Todd was doing software
 I was doing everything else and I was the all-star like I'm doing the webinars and flying around the world
 I'm speaking I'm doing something my hands getting raised over and over and over again and started growing
 It started getting harder and harder for me to to handle that right and I remember um
 Uh three years ago. It was I was like this the spot where it's just like the pressure was so much
 I was just like a breaking point. I'm like, I don't know what to do this and uh, and I can't
 I remember where I was at it was some other conversation
 But the pop the thought the pop in my head was like you have to transition from being the all-stars
 I mean the coach
 Like the time I hired a couple people and they they would go they'd write copy for me
 They'd build a funnel for me and like they do it and and I felt like it was like michael jorne
 Like, you know, there's there are people those ups takes to shoot a shot
 He's like I shoot their grab and just dunk on him right?
 I thought I was doing that like my team would come in and they'd get some like oh this sucks
 I go and just leave it all and rewrite it and fix it all and like oh, I'm an all-star like like how good I am
 And it was holding me back and then back and everything and I was like I have to make this transition to
 To being the coach, right? So that was this the whole second phase was like
 You know and get it it's first. It's hard, but now I'm looking at my team now my team is getting so good
 Like they're producing stuff and they're creating without me and it's like and it's like sending like now
 They want something I'm like that like like it's it's sending like it feels better getting your hand raised when your team is doing now
 It's interesting
 You've got a great model really quick. I just want to interject from wrestling
 You know, I mean Dan Gable was kind of seen as the the greatest wrestler of all time
 And then he was and now he's kind of universally recognized as the greatest coach
 Of all time as well across all sports, right?
 I mean, I you know, there are very few people who would deny that Dan Gable, you know, is the best coach
 Of any sport of all time, right?
 Or like think about how many people like making a jump from that like how many great athletes never become coaches
 You know, I mean like it's it's uh, it's an and I think
 Excuse me a lot of it is the ego, right? It's it's
 It's been really hard for me at both coach my kids and then coaching the team like there's this ego thing
 You're like I can do it better or whatever. It's like it's so hard
 And so anyone that can make that transition from from all sort of coach like I have so much respect for him because it it's it takes a lot
 You go and spring it man because I tell you yeah the ego battle is probably you know, V
 Well, I mean, that's uh, that's the battle, right?
 Because that because the ego kind of drives you that pride drives you so much
 It's the beginning. It's the fuel initially
 It's it's the reason why I want your handers like eagles the driving force initially
 And then it becomes the thing that holds you back in the next phase, right?
 What like you were such a great friend over here now you're screwing me
 Well, that's the genius of the design of the universe, right? It's like every time we think we've got to figure it out. It's like
 You don't because you know, whatever designed this whatever your cosmology of the universe is call it god or whatever is
 Infinitely smarter than you are and it's going to come up with so many ways to trick you and keep you off balance that every time you think
 You got it dialed in there's going to be a new challenge. It's going to come up
 It's it's and it's and you have to you have to love that. It's kind of beautiful, right?
 Because I mean that's it's what keeps life interesting. It would be so dull without it. Yeah, it's so much fun
 Hey everybody, this is Russell again and really quick. I wanted to invite you to join
