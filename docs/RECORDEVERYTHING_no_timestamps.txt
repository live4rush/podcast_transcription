 What's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the marketing
 secrets podcast. On today's episode I want to talk about the reason why you
 need to record everything you say for the rest of your life. At least most of the
 time. So the big question is this. How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't
 cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets? How
 do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the
 things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain profitable? That is
 the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson
 and welcome to marketing secrets.
 So everybody okay so as you know I am neck deep in this process where I am
 going deep into the archives of a whole bunch of things like we bought Dan
 Kennedy's company and I have this hard drive with like everything the Dan
 Kennedy's ever said. Every video, every audio, every thing he's written like it's
 insane. 99% of no one's ever seen before and I'm finding these gems and these
 things and I'm pulling them out and we're republishing them, we're using them as
 lead magnets, we're using them as podcast episodes, we're using them as just all
 sorts of stuff right? I'm having the time of my life. If you've been listening to
 my episodes later they've also in this thing where I'm going and I'm buying all
 these old personal development books and old business books and you know
 things that are that are in the public domain which I probably do an episode
 more on what public domain is but basically there are things that the
 copyrights expired. So I can take these things and I can republish them so like
 Napoleon Hill for example I'm trying to piece together everything that he's ever
 said like every article hero I'm finding all the old magazines, the news
 letters and all the things I'm finding his old magazines I'm finding all the
 books and courses and times he's spoken just every I can find and gathering all
 this stuff because I'm able to take all these these things that are in the
 public domain the copyrights expired and I can use them again for lead magnets
 and for things like that and it's been interesting I've been going deep into
 you know these different things all of Dan Kennedy stuff and also Napoleon
 Hill's and a bunch of other people I'm researching and finding all this stuff
 and it reminded me of an experience that happened to me about 20 years ago I was
 at my very first internet marketing seminar ever there's almond morn's big
 seminar and at the at the seminar he had a speaker named John Childers and John
 was actually one of the guys I first learned public speaking from and I don't
 remember everything John said that David I do remember one thing he said every
 time you talk make sure you record it he said because you can use those things
 for bonuses and for you know for lead magnets for upsells for it for all sorts
 of stuff and at first I was like why would I record myself like no one who
 cares what I'm saying right but I am very coachable and so I said okay well he
 told me to record myself so I'm gonna start doing it and so I started recording
 all the things I do have conversations with cool people I record them like in
 fact back in the day was hard they can't remember going to Radio Shack and I
 bought this old cassette player and then in the cassette player you had to hook it
 to to your phone it was hardwired into the thing and always had things then you
 can call them and you click record on the thing and record the actual phone call
 in fact I wonder if I could find it I remember Mark Joiner who's my very first
 mentor ever I had a call with him and I remember recording it he said something
 about like that's a that's a ten million dollar year I did and I was like what
 and I remember on the tape I wrote ten million dollar ideas on this cassette
 tape and it was this this call I had with Mark way back in the day and now I'm
 wondering where in the world I could be I want to find that anyway I digress so
 I started recording everything so I had this this thing hooked to my tape
 plan I'd click record every time I'd call somebody I'd do an interview or
 I'd do everything I was recording all these things and I have tons of them and
 it's it's interesting anyway I'll go I'll come back that but then I started
 doing my first courses and I recorded those in fact my very first course ever
 was called public domain how to which is when I was first learning about public
 domain stuff way back 20 years ago which is fascinating now that anyway you guys
 will see over the next 12 18 months of my life how much I'm doing inside the
 public domain it's exciting but I started that journey 20 years ago and I
 first learned about it I was doing all sorts of things and my first course I
 ever did was teaching people the process of finding public domain works how to
 how to create derivative works like a whole bunch of really cool stuff back in
 the day right and so that course I recorded on my tape player from from
 radio shack and it was like anyway it's so crazy and then I started interviewing
 people I interviewed Vince James who was the guy who made a hundred million
 dollars selling supplements through direct mail and he recorded that on my my
 little radio shack recorder and then later teleseminar lines came out so
 recording teleseminars and then she was webinars and then I speak at events and
 like I was just recording all these different things right and it's interesting
 like as I've been going down this path with Dan stuff and with Napoleon Hill
 and I'm trying to find these pieces I started realizing like I have tons of
 stuff like tons of stuff in my archives that someday hopefully when I die there
 would be some dude like me in the 200 years from now I was like I want to find
 all Russell stuff and republish it and sell it so I was like I'm gonna make it
 easy for that person so I started going through all my archives and my
 brother who's been filming me man for probably almost 15 years now maybe longer
 I'm like Scott where's this and where's this and he's like finding all these old
 videos and he's like the very first event I ever did ever and then just you
 know different places I spoke at and we're gonna find all the archives of this
 stuff and then we're putting together and what I'm doing is because I'm like
 you know some stuff's not relevant anymore some things are are timeless and you
 know there's just all these amazing things and so what I'm doing now is I'm
 creating one page here so to me is remember one page or one page here's
 one of my favorite tools if you go to one pager.io it's this tool you can
 create one pagers think of a one pager like a like a lead magnet or a course
 or something that's it's all built and software creates on one page so I'm doing
 I now some creating a one pager off of each of these old things I have back
 in the day so like my public domain how to course I had these audio files off my
 radio stack tape player so you got them digitalized and I also have a workbook
 that I found in the archives from that from that course and I'm making a one
 page and it's the public domain how to and it's a one page with my four or five
 audio tracks my PDF and it's like it's all there now so one pager that I have
 and do that with my affiliate bootcamp I'm doing it with my underchiever secrets
 I'm doing it with micro continuity I'm doing like like everything I've ever
 created in the past forever I'm trying to put it into these little one pagers
 and I'm deleting this stuff it's not relevant like things that were very focused
 on you know the search engine algorithms at the time or whatever but I'm trying
 to find all the times I talked or teach or whatever and putting it into these
 one pagers maybe thinking Russell why would you do that that's a whole kind of
 stuff that like you gonna sell that and the answer is probably not but I can use
 these things for bonuses I can use them for affiliate contests I can use them for
 bribes I can use them for lead magnets I can use them for all sorts of stuff I
 tell you guys right now after I launched my after we do our big my first public
 domain launch I'll be doing later this year around a whole bunch of cool in the
 point he'll stuff I found I launched that and you see the process I think
 pretty conservatively will make at least a million dollars on the initial rollout
 to our list after I do that if I came back and said you guys know it 20 years
 ago is the first time I learned about public domain and now 20 years later I
 did launch with some old stuff I found on eBay we made a million dollars in a
 day or a week or whatever ends up being right like how many I'd like to hear the
 original time I taught this 20 years ago I was awkward I was shy but had the
 actual audio files from my tape player that I got from Radio Shack and I have
 the original PDF and there's a couple parts that are outdated but who here
 lumped that initial that course like it's amazing okay I'll give you that course
 if you register for my webinar I'm gonna teach you guys about public domain or or
 if you sign up for the Napoleon Hill thing as a bonus I'm gonna give you this
 course that's gonna show you how I found these public domain things and how I
 turned them into derivative works right but now it's a bonus I can use right
 now I have I think we created like 25 or 31 pages of things in the past that I
 have that literally now that I have these things I can I can republish them I can
 give them this bonus I can do like anything I want like let's say Dean and
 Tony wanted me to promote something I can look at my one page is like oh here's
 here's three cool one pages from old events I did that are known seen in 20
 years that is amazing I can bundleistic it I can have this together I can you
 next time I'm creating an offer for one of my books I can say oh here's my new
 book coming out oh here's three one page I created from an event 10 years ago
 actually be really cool as bonuses and also like I can start stacking and
 creating things very very quickly very very rapidly right and anyway so I
 wanted to share with you guys because there's time like even now like for
 example last summer my kids were at Scout Camp my my twins and they asked me
 the church asked me if I go up and I provide speak to the kids about goal
 setting and so I went up there I spent 90 minutes talking to these kids about
 goal setting and it was I don't want to pat myself on the back but I'm really
 proud of it like it was a fire presentation like it was it was good the
 kids were like motivated going crazy and I was like I was in my elements I'm
 trying to show up to my kids and all these kind of things and when it was
 done I was like oh I wish I would have recorded that how cool of a bonus of that
 had been if I was like hey you know when I launched my new public domain book
 and be like hey or not my new public domain my new my personal
 development book is coming out someday if I have a chance to write it and that
 book comes out like hey use book plus one time I did a summer camp for my kids
 and this is my one shot to sit in front of my kids and teach them like how to
 have goals and how to have success all kind of stuff and the presentation is
 amazing and blah blah blah and I recorded who ever wants the audit
 recording of that session it is my kids right and and their friends at Scout Camp
 like that would be an amazing bonus I could have included you know and there's
 so many other times where I got teams I was like I mean my team or other things
 I was like I wish I would record more things like this and so I'm sharing
 this with you guys because I want you to get in the mindset of like you need to
 be recording everything you're doing right every phone call every console
 every time you're talking to somebody every time you know somebody comes in
 like every time you're in a unique situation where we're in an event and
 we're in a hotel room talking about this thing I pulled my phone out and
 recorded because it's amazing and now it's become this like underground bonus
 that nobody else can get anywhere in the world right and anyway it's just it's
 just powerful so this is like really reminding me to like be more intelligent
 about capturing myself and capturing my conversations you guys are recording
 most of my stuff here on my iPhone and I just talk written and people always
 ask me what Mike do you like I literally just talking to my phone there's no
 Mike but if you do want there's a little iPhone lav mic on Amazon fight 20 bucks
 or something and it plugs into your phone and it has a little thing and you can
 clip on a thing and it makes audio even better but you could do that have a
 little thing keeping your pocket in fact I have one in my backpack keeping in
 your pocket your backpack or whatever and then when you're at a dinner and you're
 having a cool conversation about whatever your topic is they quit real
 quick let's record this plug it in okay now say that again and then get you know
 capture this whole thing and also now you have this secret unedited audio file
 from the dinner where your friend explains you the blah blah blah like the
 thing that that was the you know the thing that changed everything for you or
 whatever it is like literally could be in fact one of my friends Matt
 Beysach I remember back the day he did he had this free plus shipping CD it was
 called pillow talk and it was him and his wife sitting in bed talking about
 their business and he just recorded it and it's like oh it was this amazing
 thing where it was just him and his wife talking about business and it became a
 free plus shipping offer that crushed it right like how many different things
 like that you could be in the airplane and you know reading or listening
 podcast having an idea and you sneak into the bathroom then plug in your phone
 like hey I'm on the airplane bathroom right now I just learned this cool thing I'm
 so excited I had to hide here to explain it to you because I wanted to make sure
 I had top of mind before I forgot it and it's like the lost airplane bathroom
 interview you know you lost bathroom secrets something you know 30,000 feet
 in the air the biggest thing that was so powerful I record this my kids I didn't
 want to lose it right and this is easy to make these hooks anyway so think
 about that because as you're recording yourself you're not going to use it right
 now like you can start using things for so many different different ways right
 people always tell me like I created my product Russell like what should I
 clue to the bonus and then they're like trying to go create a bonus and try to
 figure out things and it's like man if you would have been documenting these
 things while you're doing it like there's a million bonuses right I said I think
 we have 25 or 31 pages that we've been building over the last week and half
 two weeks of just old stuff that I have and there's way more I have way more
 things that we're gonna be putting together and pulling more things together
 but now I have all these things in a spot where man I can create an offer in a
 heartbeat it takes me five seconds I open a one-page or look at my list of
 here's all the Russell's one page is like oh cool I'm gonna do a bonus I'm
 gonna give you this and this and this and this if you come to my live event I'm
 gonna do this this this if you buy my course I'm gonna you know fast I can do
 that now because I have the recordings of these amazing things and then the
 story behind the recording why it's so awesome wish Napoleon Hill would have
 done more that wish Dan Kenney would have done more of that so we'd have to go
 and search these things but for you and for me we can do that today right now so
 there you go there's a feedback start recording everything you do it can be
 audio it could be video it could be written it could be text I don't care
 do those things I mean right now like think about such you've already published
 like we went and found Dan Kennedy he published a blog post for years and and
 then their site went down and there's no longer available so we literally went
 back to the way back machine which shows snapshots of the old website we had
 someone go through all Dan Kennedy's old blog post that he literally wrote
 himself we copied and pasted them all and now if you go to if you go to magnetic
 marketing.com and click on blog those are literally blog posts from Dan back in
 the day that we found in the archives and posting there for you guys because
 it's like oh here's the gift like it's oh there's just so much cool stuff you
 can do like buy from all the things you're creating right so just remember that
 as you're talking you are creating and you can record it and you know you can
 not record it and it's gone forever or you can record it and can live on and be
 used to benefit you over and over and over and over again so there you go
 record everything get a mic or just use your phone or whatever but just start
 capturing stuff you never know how or when you're gonna use it but maybe you
 could use it I would never know 20 years ago when I recorded my public domain
 course that it's now gonna be the sexiest thing I guarantee all you guys
 want to buy that for me now right now don't you admit it you want to buy it you
 want a free copy you'll register for webinar you'll buy a product if I give
 that to you won't you admit it you will let me know that way I can put it
 together make some offer anyway okay that's all I got I'm gonna bounce I am
 so tired I only slept 30 minutes last night so if I sound tired or they've been
 talking too fast or if I'm confusing it all that's probably why but the day's
