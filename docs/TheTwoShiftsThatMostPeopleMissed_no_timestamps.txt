 Hey everybody, this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast
 I am really really really really excited for this episode and the next episode
 I'm excited to all of them otherwise I wouldn't publish them, but these are two
 I'm really excited about because this is based on
 Something amazing that happened in fun of hacking live for those who were there you experienced it
 My guess is even if you were there you may have missed these two comments
 They were made by Lindsey Sterling that has such a big profound impact on me
 And so I wanted to actually share them with everybody today and hopefully it'll give you guys the same impact as well
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody so this year fun hacking live I guess was last year now still this year, but
 The last most recent fun hacking live
 I wanted to end the event with something amazing
 You know in the past two years prior to Tony Robbins come which is always amazing because I wanted some different and fun and unique and
 We went back and forth and finally we decided to do like a concert with that
 Who should we get to a concert and
 After you know a lot of brainstorming go back and forth
 We decided to invite Lindsay Sterling and if you don't know who Lindsay Sterling is just go to YouTube and search look her up
 You'll see
 She was on America's Got Talent a few years ago and she's a dancing violinist and she got kicked off after a couple seasons and then
 a little while later she came out and blew up and became this huge thing and
 It's amazing like her videos on YouTube and her music is is amazing
 And so that was so much fun to have her come and play violin and dance and do her whole thing at like you live
 And I was excited for so that was unique a lot of people hadn't heard of it those who have seen her perform knew how much fun it was
 And she doesn't perform a lot in fact she hadn't performed for over a year when she came to find a liking live
 But they came in and performed and the performance was insane like I can't even tell you how cool it was so much
 Cooler than I hope for and I think everyone had an amazing experience, but
 After the after she performed I had a chance to live Q&A with her and I'm gonna actually that'll be next episode
 I'm gonna share live Q&A with you because it was very powerful as well
 but
 During her performance
 Twice she took a break from from dancing and playing the violin and she came and spoke in the microphone
 And she dropped some gold nuggets that were so powerful and
 You know my one fear is that you know because of an event and there's so much stuff that happened over the four days
 And this is the last thing and you're listening you're sucked into the the entertainment that I don't want
 People to miss these two comments because I thought both of them were so so so powerful
 And so I went back to the videos and I found those those clips of her and I'm gonna play both those clips
 You can hear them and I set up each one
 So I'll set the first one right now
 So this was after she had came in saying you know
 I'm not saying she had played the first song and she came in and introduced herself to to the funnel hacking community
 Which is kind of fun, but she told her story about you know
 We always talk about how and click funnels your own funnel way and she told her story about how
 You know she was very so much thing happened to her where she found out about YouTube and I don't want to spoil surprise
 But she tried she published and she published and she published and tried and tried and tried to boom
 One of them hit and she's gonna tell you guys that story right now, but as you're listening to this just think back
 Because I guarantee wherever you are in your business right now if you were the beginning phase or if you're in the middle or if you're
 Wherever you're at
 We're always hitting these platforms. We're always hitting these things and this
 As I listened to it again tonight gave me like re inspired me about like
 Yes, I gotta keep publishing keep putting it out keep moving it forward
 So hopefully it'll do the same for you. So I'm gonna keep this first clip and then we come back
 I'll I'll explain the second one right after
 Thank you. Thank you so much. What an amazing enthusiastic group
 It is an honor literally to perform in front of people who who give me energy back
 So thank you so much
 That's how I see a performance. It's an exchange
 We will work our butts off up here and
 We appreciate it when you give us something to feed off of and to thrive with
 So what's up my funnel hackers?
 My click funnels my funnels. What's the proper term? Oh?
 I got it the first time what's up funnel hackers. How are you?
 You know they brought me not only because I'm a violinist and a dancer
 But also they really brought me here because I can speak your language. I can use words like algorithm
 data analytics
 Yeah, okay
 beta testing
 But you know being at this event
 And the energy the like extreme amount of positive energy and the pure excitement that I can just feel in this room
 From what you've experienced this week
 It gets me super amped because I remember when I first
 Found my first bit of success
 You know and I was playing open mic nights and I was doing all the thankless gigs
 Just trying to get anyone to listen to my music like for years
 And then I remember sitting one day
 I heard about this class that was being taught after hours at school at BYU
 And it was a one-time like little seminar on the platform of YouTube
 And I remember thinking well this sounds interesting
 I don't really get what it's all about but I for some reason I went and
 The same enthusiasm that I feel from you guys is what I experience as I sat in this little
 seminar this like three hour long, you know
 I guess tutorial on how to use YouTube as a marketing platform
 And my mind was blown and I remember leaving that room
 Knowing that this was the way and I've been I've been getting pretty discouraged
 I've been doing so much and nothing was happening and I was kind of almost at my like well
 I just don't know how much longer I can continue this type of a face and
 That is when I went to this YouTube class and it clicked and I just knew that this was how I was going to
 Make it I knew it was going to work too
 And I can sense that same excitement enthusiasm from you guys and when you get that you can work forever
 You can work endlessly because you've got that
 That fire under you and you know I started my YouTube channel literally the next day
 Start putting up videos and it was about
 10 months later
 After putting up quite a few videos that finally the video hit
 That changed my life and within 24 hours that video had a million views
 And I remember for me at the time I had like a hundred thousand subscribers
 Which I was very excited about very proud of those
 But you know at this point I got several you know maybe like 50,000 views in a day on a good video and to get a million in a day
 I remember first thinking that my computer or the internet was broken something had to be wrong
 But then I realized I think my life just changed and the thing that's really cool about
 This story to me looking back on it in hindsight is that you never know
 When your moment is gonna be I think for almost every artist or entrepreneur
 You know you work you work you work you work you work and then all of a sudden you're an overnight success
 To the rest of the world, but you never know if that breakthrough moment is literally tomorrow
 If it's in a month if it's in a year
 And so that's what kept me going and kept me excited was the fact that I it could have been just around the corner
 Any day and then finally this next song
 Crystallized is the song that changed my life
 All right, wasn't that awesome so good all right now I said the second one because this one I
 Think is even more powerful
 It's interesting as I've been doing this business now 15 plus years
 I've seen a lot of people in different situations people were on stage or one way and people off stage are different
 I've seen people who came in as really good people and the industry
 Many of them a lot of money made a lot of fame and a lot of people lost their way
 And it's very very sad to me in fact one of the things that I say my biggest fear is that
 My journey in this whole thing I'm gonna lose myself lose lose my way and I'm very very conscious of that very
 careful with that
 Along the journey and it's been sad as I've seen so many people I love and care who have lost their way as success has come to them and
 Anyway, it was interesting because because Lindsay during her second break during her performance
 Talked about this with herself and the commitment and the covenant she made with God
 To that you know if he was gonna bless her with success that she would be willing to go
 Ever he wanted her to go and that she wouldn't change it she would remain the same and it was such a
 For me such a powerful moment
 I think a lot of people probably missed but it was one of the most powerful moments of funnel hacking light for me
 and so I want you to hear and her own words the next clip where she tells about that commitment that she made and
 Hopefully as you guys listen to this
 Once again no matter where you are in your business right now, especially at the beginning stage
 I challenge you to make that same commitment to God or whoever you believe in
 to
 Remain the same to not shift as a person not become a bad person or shift because of you know fame or money or success because
 You know when all said and done know that stuff really matters really matters how it treated people along the way
 So that said I'm gonna let you guys listen to the last clip from Lindsay and then on the next podcast episode
 I'm gonna bring you guys in behind the scenes of why CUNY I did a funnel hacking knife
 Thank you so much you guys, you know, I wrote that song from the place of the independent woman inside myself
 Don't need a man to hold my hand, but I want one to hold my heart
 You know after it was kind of my I don't need a man, but I need a man song
 And you know
 Sorry, I am a little out of shape
 Um
 If you can't tell by my heavy breathing, but you know
 In this pursuit, you know when I look back over like where I came from and where I am now
 In this pursuit of following my dreams
 You know it's such an interesting process to make sure that the things that were important to you when you started
 Are the things that are important to you when you get to wherever it is you're going and
 You know
 I'm a very very
 Spiritual person also very very religious and when I first started to see that my
 You know career was becoming an actual career and things were happening and opportunities were coming and I realized like oh my gosh
 I think this is working in a way it terrified me because I thought to myself like I don't want to change
 I don't want to lose myself in the process of all this and so I remember
 I made a promise right then and there to God and
 I
 Promised God that I would do everything I could to stay on the foundation that had brought me to this point
 And be true to the values that I'd lift by up to that point and my beliefs
 Because that had been a foundational element of my life and I figured if I kept that
 There's only so far off I can go if my foundation is the same and so I made this promise to God that if
 You know, I'm gonna do everything I can to keep my end of this bargain and to stay true to who I am and in return
 Take me wherever you want me to go wherever is meant to be and
 You know some people especially when I first was getting a lot of traction and a lot of success
 People thought I was so smart and I had just beat the system
 I'd found this back doorway into the music industry and you know this girl's really really smart is what everybody was saying
 But the fact of the matter is is that I was so led and guided and I feel like I owe so much of my success
 To that promise I made in my college apartment in Provo, Utah
 And
 You know this next song is called Maraj
 And I think the concept of a mirage is so interesting because you know, it's this thing in the distance
 That looks appealing whether it's you know if you're lost in the desert
 That's the easiest way to think of a mirage if you're lost in the desert and you're so thirsty so so so thirsty
 You're dying of thirst and in the distance you see a little pool of water and if you chase that pool of water with everything you've got
 Trusting that mirage you'll get there and there'll be nothing to sustain you and that's how I think of
 Goals and dreams. They're wonderful to chase
 But if that's all you're after is the end goal and you lose sight of your foundation
 You will get there and you'll realize there's nothing to sustain you
