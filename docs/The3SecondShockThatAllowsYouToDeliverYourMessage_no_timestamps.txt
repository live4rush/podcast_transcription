 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing secrets podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 [Music]
 Alright everyone hope things going awesome. We had such a fun day today
 Tuesday has become my days where I like block out time film all the stuff we got to film
 I remember
 man when was it probably three or four years ago?
 So I can Mike Philstain. He's been a close friend for a decade now and
 I remember he told me to him and Andy Jenkins. I used to be business partners with company webinar jam and traffic genesis and stuff
 And he told me he had a pithney one day
 It's like the more you say we make money when we're on camera
 And so like the more videos they make the more camera time they make them or mind they make and so that was their big epiphany
 They need to spend more time making videos because that's how they make money
 And I've kind of recently come the same thing like I make the most money inside a click funnels as a pitch person
 He's out there talking about click funnels and talking about why it's awesome and all that kind of stuff and so
 Basically every Tuesday we're blocking out. It's like filming day now
 So I'm filming a whole bunch of stuff
 So I filmed a new thank you page webinar for the dot com secrets book funnel. I filmed a whole bunch of promo videos
 I filmed up so videos I filmed all these things and in the day I had two other videos of what I was supposed to
 Fit make I didn't really want to make so I was like ah have that 15 minutes left
 And I was like you know what we should do we should go and do some fun ones
 And it's been fun. I'm watching one of my buddies Dean grassy. You'll see he has been
 We've been kind of sharing notes with book funnels. He's got a book funnel that's killing
 I got a book a couple book funnels
 That are also been really really well and I'm watching his ads and ads have been so fun
 Like he had one we lose book on fires like this book is literally on fire
 You should go buy it and then he had a bunch of magic trick ones one where he's in his Tesla and clicks the screen
 Tesla also in the book pops out
 He holds it when we've got the book up in the empty box
 He shakes up there and like 50 copies of the book dumped out of it
 And just these little things like capture people's attention
 And I was like we start doing more those kind of things like just some fun things and so we're sitting there
 We have like a little time to film as like let's cool like let's let's do a fun like video
 Maybe it could completely bomb, but it could be awesome. Who knows and so like we should do a potato gun video where I'm shooting
 Expert secrets book the potato gun and looking around and we see the big cardboard cut out of our gold prospector
 I'm like we should take the book the gold prospectal that he's holding it
 Then I'll shoot the gun at the gold prospector and blow it the book and
 He got from one thing to the next the next hole, you know 15 minutes later
 We're out in the field with the Jeep
 What's the kind of background so looks just firm the pattern interrupts?
 Just Jeep with red headlights shining at the camera and then we said slow motion camera as well
 And then there's this gold prospector cut out with a copy of the expert's secret book tape to him and
 First thing I say is hey, man
 I'm also Brunson
 I'm a potato gun expert and I turn the potato gun towards the prospector and like point blank like three inches from where
 He is I shoot this potato gun at him and like he explodes the book flies in the air
 We got slow motion the whole thing happening
 And then I come back and I'm like whoa we can't I'm gonna throw the potato gun on the ground and then Dave Woodward
 Offscreen throws me copy of my the book. I'm like hey my address
 So Brunson I got my new book called expert secrets
 You should get a free copy of it
 And I just did this crazy pitch for the book and it was so much fun
 We had such a good time and and then when that was done Dave decided to teach me how to use a Jeep because I got my new Jeep
 That's awesome
 But I'm kind of a city boy who's scared of Jeep so we went and drive and in this mud pit flipping circles and stuff
 And you want me to go up on this huge hills like open this hill and like it scared me to death
 It was one of the scariest things ever and he kept telling me say no you're what's it now?
 You gotta go I go up it go over the top of it
 I didn't dare so I jumped out and I had him going in he goes and first thing is goes up this huge hill
 I didn't high center is the Jeep and it's completely stuck and we can't get it to move. It's it's like it's saying high center
 there's like
 like more dirt like all the like
 I can't explain it's like it was like in mud because there was dirt all the way up to the car underneath like anyway
 It was it was crazy and completely stuck
 And so we had called his son Christian to come in and basically to get a winch and like to pull it out
 But when we're doing that we have like 20 minute break before he could get here
 So right what should we do for 20 minutes like let's burn a book like Dean burned a book
 I want to burn a book and so we got a book and we try to light on fire
 We found it's kind of hard to have lighter fluids
 I drove to the grocery store about lighter fluid came back and soaked my book in lighter fluid about this time
 They got the Jeep out. It's pitch black. I told my kids the cheapest stuck in the mud
 So they all came over my wife my kids are there and and so finally it's like pitch black outside and right
 Well, his book is soaking wet with lighter fluid like we need to do this thing
 So I sat in the Jeep and I lit the book on fire and it's like flames going crazy everywhere
 It looked awesome because it was super dark outside and as this book is burning and I'm like this book is on fire
 You need to go get your copy right now and just made a really quick fun promo video
 That turned out to look so cool because it's dark and the flames are bright and it just
 I'm sitting in my car at the time. I guess it's crazy and it was done
 I held the book up and did like an Instagram ad much other ones about this flaming book and just had so much fun
 Like the last hour of the day was insanely fun and insanely cool and I started thinking I'm like man
 you know like
 So often most of us are trying to like do things the right way like like we set the funnel the right way
 And then we drive ads and buy image ads and we get ads with memes on like all these things we're doing trying to make things
 what good like what's everyone else doing we're doing it and
 What I'm kind of realizing watching some of these you know people I know whose ads are killing
 It's like the rare unique weird things right?
 It's the pattern interrupts things like some season Facebook and they share with their friends or they have to buy or they're
 Scrolling us they stop and like what Russell's things on fire. Why is he shooting a potato gun at a cut out of this?
 You know like it's the pattern interrupt that wins and I just had this big epiphany in my mind
 That was just like we need to start doing more things like that like how many cool crazy weird things can we do?
 They get some to stop scrolling and so you can share your thing
 I talked to Dean and his guy a little bit like one of the keys that are found these magic tricks
 It's like you something in the first like three seconds that captures their tension and he triscent transition to your book pitch
 And so soon in the next week or two you'll see these ads go live and maybe they might bomb they may do amazing
 I don't know
 But I think they're gonna do really really good and now my mind sits on the scene like how do we create crazy ads to stop?
 Scrollers just stop everyone the thing really quick and this we can move transition into a call to action
 Like how do we how do we grab them and just stop them where they're at in their tracks enough to get their tension and then
 And then and then and then make a special offer and so I just want to shout out to yesterday because I think so much so many
 Times we are so stuck in like the minutiae of business and building funnels and sales pitches and all this kind of thing
 It's like let's have some fun again
 Like what are the weird things you can do with your front end products to get people to stop?
 You can even stop that's 99% of the battle nowadays like everyone's got
 In fact, I'm already a script about this right now
 But like the average human has a seven second attention span seven seconds a goldfish has eight we have shorter attention spans and goldfish
 Which is crazy like back in the 80s with a 20 minute attention spent now around a seven seconds and so
 When you understand like our people at seven seconds like you've got to like do something insane to grab them
 So magistrate blowing a book up lighting on fire
 Whatever like the crazy or the better and so today was fun to me to those and just got me excited
 I'm starting a whole bunch more and just want to show you guys so that hopefully gives you some freedom have some fun with your ads
 Do some crazy things that that just make no logical sense, but just do it just to do it
 And who knows I look at Dean's ad like one of the book on fire has like four million views
 The one of the magic tricks got even more like they're doing insanely well
 So if you start thinking like said like what's the mean to add I can do today?
 That's gonna have a good quote something to share it instead like how do something interesting that actually gets people to stop
 So that can make them a special offer
 And so that's a one share yesterday
 Do something crazy to make them stop so you can give them a special offer
 So anyway check out Facebook Instagram
