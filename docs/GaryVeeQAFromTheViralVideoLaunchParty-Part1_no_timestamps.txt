 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to marketing secrets next
 trip so I've got some exciting things for you as you know we just got done with
 our viral video launch event which turned out amazing and our keynote speaker was
 Gary Vaynerchuk and in his contract he said we are not allowed to stream nor
 share his presentation but they did the presentation and he messaged me after
 and said that was probably one of the best presentations I've ever given I was
 like sweet man can I promote it on the podcast and he was like you know what go
 for it so that's what's happening so we actually have his presentation now the
 first like 15-20 minutes of his presentation he kind of just rambled for
 a little bit didn't really have I think he was trying to figure out what he
 wanted to talk about and then he switched to Q&A for next like hour and half and
 Gary's the key in Q&A and it's really good so what I'm gonna do is we pulled
 out the Q&A and so I'm gonna do two 45 minute episodes here for you but for
 all of you my fans and follower people who listen to me you know that I keep
 my podcast nice and clean I don't swear a curse or anything Gary does a lot so I
 had my brother go through and beep out all the bad words so hopefully it'll
 still be PG rated for all of the kids at home and that's kind of game plan so
 hopefully you enjoy this episode of podcast appreciate you all and have fun
 listening Gary so the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who
 didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets
 how do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and
 the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain profitable
 that is the question in this podcast give you the answer my name is Russell
 Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 what's up Gary we're gonna check thanks for being here thanks my question is I
 know you you say that it's gonna end all with robots killing everybody I hope
 so but until then yes what role do you think AI artificial intelligence and
 robots have huge I mean are going to have in the next five years in the marketing
 and digital marketing space huge even in the 15 minutes that I've gotten a better
 taste of what these characters are up to they're gonna love it like the math
 people are gonna love it because machine learning and AI just do that we shouldn't
 be doing like it's just efficiency it's gonna have an enormous thing like but
 the good news is like there's so much that we still can do and so basically
 how I think about you know ML and AI back at the pad is get me to third and
 half base and I'll take care of the rest and whatever AI can do for that cool and
 whatever low-priced employees that can do cool but like everybody is spending
 way too much money to get the third and half base and then the magic is the last
 part so that's what AI is gonna mean for everybody here there's a lot of dumb
 that people have assistance for or managers for that's nonsense zero value
 that the biggest AI companies in the world are gonna get their nut off on hey
 it's really exciting to be here in this room with you and everyone here this is
 awesome appreciate it yeah I'm really experiences that help people save time
 yeah awesome and I'm really interested in experiences that are time-bending and
 help people just lose time and I'm interested in creating the most hardcore
 drugs no no no so here we go the world's most connective music festival okay all
 right where festival goers are connecting with each other like never
 before yep and with the artists and the artists with their fans okay and so in
 2021 I'm talking about the mixed reality so 2021 good music festivals
 connection the best time of people's lives what do you see happening in the
 context of music festivals that you're excited about and that you're excited
 about creating so if I dissect that right couple things one thing I'm super
 fascinated by that I would never seen by the way I never spend any time
 predicting like like voice not predicting it's happening right what I
 think I'm good at is like recognizing murders when it's practical and then
 going pot committed right which means you'll lose money for a couple years and
 get it you don't lose for seven years and never get there the thing that's been
 super fascinating to me that I would never thought which social media is
 making people do more in real life like literally some dude is hiking right now
 just for the Instagram photo right so so what's been amazing about music
 festivals is because everybody here now is not only themselves but they're the
 PR agent of themselves for what they're putting out people are going to more
 concerts than ever because of that whole dynamic I think what you're alluding to
 is kind of like what's gonna happen in society like in general like mixed
 reality things of that nature it's you know it's gonna be funny
 technologies making music you know going to music grow and then it's gonna
 take it away but I don't think it's as soon as 2021 but I think that right now
 a lot of music festivals are failing because they all have the same
 facts and it's just supply and demand and so when you were first four or five
 six years ago you win and now there's 87 micro festivals and big companies sign
 the same 13 artists and so I think there's a huge white space for the next
 generation of that like the people that the streets with right and then and then
 I think that ultimately it's gonna be really interesting just in general what
 happens when we live in a mixed reality world I think the big arbitra the only
 thing that's gonna break the Internet is VR but VR is quite a ways away like
 nobody here spends an hour on VR in a month in real life so we're a long like
 it takes time behavior takes time but eventually when we're switching between
 completely virtual like I don't even see you guys right now my contact lenses
 have me in Afghanistan switch it off I'm right here switch it off and it's AR
 and Santa Claus is sitting right there you know Santa you know that world I
 think is super interesting and is gonna change all our businesses thanks man
 cool yep hey Sean Gary you just came back from August and you said I'm
 bringing YouTube fire new shows are coming out and you took the asker you
 showed to Facebook only I did so what are your latest strategies and why for
 both YouTube and Facebook I think you have to make content that is native to the
 platform you put it out on I've always thought about that wrote a book called
 Javji's Haverick five years ago on this I wasn't doing that so now that ask
 Gary V show is on Facebook watch and the Daily V is on YouTube when DRock is
 where DRock hey you know now I could say what's up YouTube whereas I couldn't do
 that before and those little nuances matter and you know all the action is in
 those little edges and so I broke them up mainly because of Facebook video now
 that there's watch I'm fascinated and if you watch a show yet on Facebook watch
 just raise your hands just curious higher right so this intrigues me like
 everybody here has to watch one not because like I don't watch I've watched
 one the lavar the ball family because I just want to see they're doing like to
 me this is the most interesting thing that I'm doing that the good market
 isn't you've got to taste everything like if you want to win and there's no
 way you're not Boise Idaho if you don't want to win right now
 no I mean that like like like when I think about who's here I'm like these
 people are hungry so like to me 19 hands which means maybe 31 because people get
 shy to two weeks into Facebook watch that haven't watched that's that's that's
 that's it that's that's where I play that's my margin so that's why I did it
 because I wanted to make them native I have two active shows I needed to do
 something on Facebook and because I watched Facebook actually tell you it's
 not fully announced yet but we'll see how this goes because I watched watch and I
 watched it for four you know kind of like four days in a row looked I understood
 what they were doing so I sent them an email I pitched them a show and they bought
 it right so now I'll have it kind of anybody can put a show on Facebook right
 like a page a watch page which everybody should be doing here I'll have my
 YouTube you know show and now I'm gonna have a produced by Facebook show that's
 gonna get big thing even more listen man I talk and like doing and hustle and
 all this I just like I do so much more than I talk which is crazy because my
 mouth is always running but I'm just doing I'm doing doing doing because I'm
 tasting I'm tasting I never think I'm fancy so many people in here I know you
 like so many people here make it a little bit get fancy stop stop doing
 that got them there that's the minute you're dead
 so Marshall I have a question is yeah there's a guy I fell online you might
 have heard of him's name's Gary Vaynerchuk yes he told me to push all in on
 whatever it is that you're good at yes I'm making this big push as Marshall live
 I'm going to everything live like straight to ask me questions I love that
 aspect of your brand so the question is if everything's moving to voice is live
 streaming podcast going to be end up being bigger than say iTunes or a
 recording that you can come back to so first of all you said something
 interesting that we all do if everything's moving to voice nothing moves
 nothing is everything like we will always have the written word you could
 have a do you know much virality there is through long-form written Facebook and
 Instagram posts like if you sit in here and you can write write long posts on
 Facebook and Instagram and watch what happens we are humans we've been around
 a long time bro Marshall written word audio video is locked in got it so it's
 not like you're gonna lose it like if you're great at smoke signals can
 up there you know like you know like shh communication doesn't change the the
 the pillars of communication are set where we communicate changes right and
 then you have to be contextual right some people are incredible at making a
 six-second video I keep looking at them because it's fun to see them I haven't
 seen them well others aren't like I can't put two sentences together in my
 life I have five New York Times by selling books because I have a ghost
 writer because I didn't try to become a great writer when the blogging thing
 happened because I bet on my strengths and so I do believe that everybody here
 should bet on their strengths and surround themselves with their weaknesses
 I actually think back to earlier question I think AI and machine learning is
 gonna help a lot of us in here who are creative close the gap on a lot of our
 weaknesses which is gonna be really awesome you got it yep it's Kevin yeah
 I think a lot of people in here using ClickFunnels or not have kind of come
 into a lot more money than maybe they've ever been used to making okay and in
 one of your previous sentences you said yeah you only care about money and all
 of a sudden you're 47 but then you didn't finish your sentence I was hoping
 to like hear you elaborate on that you know for I'm sure a lot of people hear
 real who let's say have come into money it's not as great as advertised for a
 lot of people some people love it they like watches and lambos and houses and
 rat like Mazeltoff you know other people don't and you start questioning what
 the right because when you're when you've got nothing and you're on the come up
 and you've got numbers in your head whether it's a million or five or three
 or whatever it is it's empty when you get there for a lot of people and so you
 know I'm just I'm just trying to make sure people are being thoughtful they're
 just much like what I just said the Marshall like life is pretty simple like
 people play on legacy on family on money like there's just a couple pillars I
 just think in our space right now you know I know a lot of you have heard me
 rant on this I do think entrepreneurship has taken a turn towards club promotion
 like you know and like that's just dangerous not it's just dangerous for
 the people that are gonna it's not I don't give a it's it's dangerous because
 people don't realize they need to build a business not a perception that they're
 good at business
 because nobody's you know when the market crashes nobody's going to Vegas
 with you when you work at Bank of America you know I'm just trying to get
 people to be more thoughtful
 sure amen how you doing I'm super well awesome so Russell and you were to last
 year I was selling websites was getting really frustrated that I wasn't helping
 people felt like they weren't growing their sales but they had a really nice
 site so you guys inspired me to start a podcast awesome didn't know exactly what
 for but just get those guys are doing it I will too more along the lines of us
 listening to a podcast in the gym host asked the other guy what would you tell
 your 20 year old self and the guy answered I would divorce my wife earlier I was
 super pissed off married with two young kids and wanted to have a podcast from
 a different perspective and so year later than God two weeks ago I got to
 publish my interview with Russell I've had Dean Rosie OC and so my question is
 number one is how do you grow even further and number two is not just for me
 but anybody starting or in progress what should your priorities be so let's
 sit here you know both both of those things I can't answer because you need to
 decide you know what first of all you have to define growing for me is growing
 being a top 50 podcast I mean like we all get into our micro games and by the
 way I think micro games are good you know little short goals micro it's kind
 of good you scratch it it's fun for a little bit I think you got to have your
 macro point of view like if you were if you're telling me the truth that you
 felt like the conversations were going in the wrong directions and you wanted
 to go a different place well the answer to your question is just do it every day
 until you're dead right like that's my plan my plan is you know hopefully it
 gets me to like this one little funny weird thing that I want to buy a football
 team but other than that my plan is to put out free that is historically correct
 so that peep so I can continue to live the life I'm living which is I made
 money I wanted to make a long time ago but getting 50 60 70 emails 80 emails a
 day of people like you helped me like that's just like intoxicating but that's
 what gets me off and I and by the way I'm not sure that like you know like I
 understand why that wouldn't be meaningful to somebody else like so you
 just have to do what you have to do for yourself right like that's how you grow
 by consistency you know you grow by you're a year in you grow when you're
 19 years into your podcast more specifically in terms of actual numbers
 yes taking the what you've done now like specifically on the number aspect of
 it what do you recommend in terms of taking your platform and kind of sky
 rockin numbers buy underpriced attention whether that's buying ads on
 Facebook and Snapchat right now because they're underpriced if that's working
 with influencers because many are still underpriced whether that's taking the
 high risk of trying to make a 10 to 50 thousand dollar version of what you just
 saw their incredible video because that one video can be your dollar shape club
 of your brand saying yes to everything like if you want it if you're hungry you
 do what I did which is four years ago when I then jumped into podcasting right
 away the first two years I just went on everyone's and so I could have went to
 sleep at 11 p.m. or I could have went on Lewis houses podcast 11 p.m. like that
 was a decision it's just about awareness like where are the eyeballs and so just
 put your time and effort into that some of it's freeing some of it cost money
 you got it hey Gary my first time seeing you your honesty is so beautiful and
 it's just wonderful listening to appreciate it someone's trying to like
 build a brand and you know get a podcast and get more into Facebook and all
 these sort of things to your knowledge what kind of some tips you have for
 building like a powerhouse team around you to help you accomplish all these
 things first it has to be practice to stay here first has to be practical so
 some people in your can afford people other people can't so they either have
 to learn how to do it themselves by spending hours looking at YouTube videos
 on how to read or finding people like we're an incredible era right now there's
 so many kids 14 to 21 that want to be creators and think it's cool to like do
 it for free because you know so you just need to test and learn everybody's
 guys everybody's overthinking just do like I don't know post right now like
 literally right now as soon as you sit down like go on whatever platform has the
 most going all of them be like I'm looking for a video and audio intern and
 see what happens like again I always tell people watch what I do not what I
 say like you I know a lot of you know there's a good amount of people I see
 here that follow me like randomly out of note I can tweet it today does anybody
 be customizable retail floor mats I need it I need it I need it like you do good
 do you do them for free in exchange for some awareness you know so you know like
 like I would ask and then try somebody and be like you know like the amount of
 people I've hired when it was early in something and I didn't know if they were
 good or bad I just thought it was much smarter to just do it and then
 figure out if it was working and then I'm like they sucked I'm just not scared to
 waste money or time and everybody's petrified because you worry about what
 other people think about you that's why if you're curious that's the answer
 that's that's the answer every like your answer is so easy how do you build a
 team hire some people bro
 right but it's like you know but you're like but I don't understand like people
 are scared to get had because they don't get it okay put it a load of time to
 learn the craft or bring someone in and watch what they're doing carefully
 instead of like outsourcing it and falling asleep because you're all
 passive income and I got a team doing stupid got it thanks yeah
 hey Gary my name is Jay and I run the inner change maker podcast and I want to
 ask a question that goes a little deeper of what you're saying in terms of sound
 and watching what you do sure we've noticed that you know you've launched a
 couple other podcasts is outside of ask Gary VE within that within my
 experience mean like the brown paper bags and that's kind of like the 365 daily
 so the 365 is an Alexa skill right okay briefing excuse me so I've been doing
 sub branding in my podcast yeah because I'm testing to see if there's traction
 and I'll spin them out and create new pillars okay so I guess my real question
 is for content creators yes started on like one platform yes for example I
 started an interview based show right just kind of like you know Q&A show yes
 if you kind of have that urge to kind of branch out do it within the interview
 show because you have audience there yeah don't worry that you may lose a
 couple people like right now as I'm sure everybody has seen for two strategic
 reasons out of nowhere I'm talking a lot more than I should be about wine right
 I'm doing it for a reason there is no question that there's people unfollowing
 me because like yo bro I came here to get pumped up because I have no juice
 the you trying to sell me actual juice right like so so but I don't give a
 because I'm playing I'm playing up like a macro game like I don't want to lose
 people from it I'm sad I don't want to I don't want to disrespect your
 attention and and know what you came for but I need to test something right and
 this is what I have and so I think it's better off for you to like try it
 because one you may hit pay dirt you know one thing a lot of people don't
 realize is your numbers look good but they're disguising the fact that you've
 plateaued and you're tired and so I think you try it within it and you take
 the risk of a little decline for enormous upside because you can always go back
 right instead of starting a whole new thing that's gonna take energy got it
 got it cool appreciate it you're welcome what I like your hat bro thank
 you appreciate that my name is Prince I want a company called Art of Visuals we
 have over a million content creators in 122 countries you said something earlier
 about everyone 14 to 22 wants to be a content creator I absolutely agree with
 that and have tons of those people in my community the problem is with there
 being so many content creators now how do these content creators how do they
 create a business how do they make money when I have thousands of people doing
 it for free being being better cool yeah it's you know it guys it's
 supply and demand and then once there's too much supply you have to be the best
 right and just move on to the next thing like I bought all the Google AdWords of
 every wine term for five cents a click the day it started that was good then
 everybody jumped on they started becoming two and three and four dollar
 words and became different then I had to be better that I'd be more crafty than I
 had a then what I started doing is the day the wine spectator would come out
 with good scores we would buy that exact wine that exact vintage that became our
 new arbitrage for a year or two before everybody caught up do you think when a
 market's mature you've got to be better do you think it's good enough just to be
 a content creator do you think this content creators need to also have
 products and other things that they're pushing as well look if you're
 steven Spielberg you probably can end up just being a content creator but if
 you're like sal you know maybe you've got to consider other revenue streams you
 know right it's just very basic business supply and demand prints right four
 years ago there are people that land grabbed they were good and they were first
 it's just real estate if you were the people that bought Malibu Beach Run
 property first you won right boys you won you made money but there's a reason
 you were the first it wasn't Malibu yet Prince and now people buy Malibu Beach
 Run properties they're just better so all those kids that like they're gonna
 aspire to be the next this they've got a rude awakening they to be the next this
 you've got to be five times better it's evolution when people debate these
 athletes versus other jet these athletes would destroy every athlete from other
 generations because they work out 24/7 now they have data now you know like it
 hurts my feelings to them my childhood kid they would get destroyed LeBron
 would step on people's heads in the 80s like people don't get it it's just
 evolution cool thanks Gary you got it great hat thanks man I don't really have
 asked for you have listened to us I mean I've watched your stuff a ton thanks
 I just want to say thank you for giving me the permission to pursue my passion
 and and now do what I love every day and spend time with my family and make
 things and I'd be remiss if I didn't say thank you because I don't know if I'll
 ever see you if you ever want to play bubble hockey I'll destroy you I know
 you say that you I know that you let well first of all I live here I there's a
 spot right down the street I can take you to play listen that's gonna happen
 now I'm a winner in Boise Idaho Gary it's so crazy you see you're funny you're
 smart you know me you know that now I'm getting like now I'm blacked out and
 want to destroy your face but the only you know it's more interesting though
 your wailers had his me up because I'm like I'm like I mean he's got a
 Hartford Wailers had this team hasn't been in the league for 20 years he
 probably is awesome at bubble hockey I'm gonna I'm gonna do something for real
 based on what you just said I want you to come to VaynerMedia for a day I'll
 pay for your flight in the hotel and during and during that day we'll play
 bubble hockey and we'll see what's up
 Oh Gary I first want to say thank you to both you and Russell you two are kind
 of like the Jesus of marketing and branding I come from a poor thrower
 country the Dominican Republic and it wasn't for you to I wouldn't be here so
 I just want to say thank you so my question right now is like what are you
 doing in other languages because right now like my main language is in
 Spanish and I see like a blue ocean Russell's always talking about blue
 ocean he's right and other languages ridiculous the blue ocean that there is
 marketing fitness whatever you name it the oceans blue so I want to know why
 are you doing his own going balls deep into Spanish so so I what I've been
 doing over the last six months I've poured an ungodly amount of money into
 infrastructure transcribe all my content into a ton of languages and pay
 distribution in them I'm spending on a norm I'm going to Singapore which is my
 second trip to Asia in the last three months going to mainland China in
 January I'm going to India in February I'm spending an enormous amount of time
 and I'll spend millions of dollars next year just on the transcription
 distribution of the content that I'm natively making in America in the
 English language so a solid amount okay I'm just like influencers
 mark influencer marketing of language like it's cheap in English in Spanish is
 pennies on the buck so it's super I mean you know again because I just can't
 because I miss them I haven't seen you like I remember when Jerome and I I was
 like Jerome you need to go and figure out who the influencers are in Mexico
 because they're like like even in music right now there's so many like I'm
 spending a lot maybe you guys are paying attention because I love hip-hop I'm
 spending more time with these artists like I keep telling them you know like
 you need to go down to South America there's so many artists there that are
 really popping you have the leverage because the brand of America I mean
 they're much bigger artists than you but you're America so you're automatically
 bigger than them yeah I mean it's very I totally agree well thank you you got
 him good luck
 Gary Kilomattox's dad I want to thank you personally for your your impact in his
 life between you and Russell Brunson seriously I mean coming from a dad there's
 no way I can repay you just the character that you've taught him so I
 thank you for that I have two part question one you gave him some advice
 last time you're with him about patience and I hear you talk about that a
 lot and I want to know as a dad you know can you expound a little bit more on
 that and then the I'll wait to answer that and have one more part about that
 right so you know it's super fun for some of us in this space we're literally
 watching your son grow up and I mean I just saw my dude you don't look 14
 anymore you know like you know so you're and now he's hanging around with all
 these faces so he's gonna get into trouble right like like he's like patience
 is important because you know he's got more swag now his secret game is stronger
 like he's going into that time of his life where dumb decisions are gonna be
 made because he's making decisions to make short-term cash because he's trying
 to arbitrage it for other things in his life like why do I preach patience because
 it's the only thing that keeps people away from being straight that's good
 thanks so what did your dad do you know you talked about he I didn't have my
 dad in my life like I mean I have my luckily still have my dad my I didn't
 know it until I started working in the liquor store like my dad left before I
 woke up and came home after I slept like as a matter of fact it's probably funny
 how I feel about you guys it's fun to watch you know because I didn't have that
 you know but what my dad did do for me ironically is because I have that kind
 of salesmanship and charisma I was completely like I would be everything I
 make fun of subtly I would be if it wasn't for my dad because at 14 15 I
 went to that liquor store and you would walk into what was called shoppers discount
 like there's back there I was 14 years old I look 9 you'd walk in and be like do
 you have this product and I'd be like yeah that we have because I was already
 full sales kid I'm like we have that product but I knew we made more money on
 this one I was like but this one's better I had it it was phenomenal 14 people
 were like you had it like yeah it's my dad's story I taste it I mean I don't
 think I took about making up I don't think I said a real thing once and and so
 my dad took me and he taught me that my dad thinks embellishing is
 straight-lying and he suffocated me over a three-year period that really changed
 the course of my life and I think a lot of my success comes from I have all the
 skill sets of that character but between being you know old country and
 really my really my dad really not allowing me to be that guy so that's
 what he did for me and I think that's what you if you know as a dad you need to
 just keep watching him evolve and when he goes into territories that you think
 are historically incorrect not new ideas and doing new no tried-and-true
 human dynamics that win-and-lose that's how you try to guide it yeah one more
 if you don't mind I'm sure a lot of these people probably have kids as well so
 like your dad was a powerful businessman and you you had a lot of ideas and
 passion as a young age what did he do to not like how did he how did you guys
 balance that was that decision of him making you stop sell baseball cards to
 come work in the liquor store was that the right decision would you do that for
 your kids I'm only asking out of curiosity because when I hear that I'm
 just very curious about it's a tricky one man first of all we were an insular
 family we're an immigrant family we didn't know there was no internet like
 we didn't know anything like like we literally just thought when you turn
 14 you go work at the store we were merchants like right like you know people
 like that you know that cliche story it just what it was I was I was my
 14th birthday was time you know my D's and F's in school weren't helping me
 with any compelling reason that I could get out of it so you know as far as how
 we did it we fought tooth and I fought for every inch I had and then I got lucky
 what happened was when I came from college my dad had saved up a lot of
 money through these years and started building a dream house for him and my
 mom and he took that year off that was and he was just not around and that year
 I took the business from three to ten million dollars in sales and that was
 the end of the debate awesome thank you man
 whenever you're Gary thanks brother hi hi my name is Sarah hi Sarah I'm really
 annoying speech so thank you I was wondering in retrospect you've built a
 brand around yourself and your name yes is that what you would recommend looking
 forward or rather more of a brand around a brand I think you I think you have to
 do both if you're gonna build it around yourself because what you're
 alluding to is you can get pigeonholed and you live and die by the person I
 think a lot of people forget with me I built my library first Gary V came
 later so it's not like I went to Caleb Ralph or say I didn't come up the game as
 me and so I know how to build like like I'm serious like it's a little bit up now
 I don't think I could pull it off but I kind of want to actually he just
 inspired me Sarah I'm literally gonna build a 25 million dollar business in the
 next three years that nobody knows his mind just to remind everybody for myself
 because I'm weird like that and I need it like that I build businesses now let
 me promise everybody in this room one thing fame is the number one arbitrage
 in our society fame is not Snapchat ads not being the first result on Google
 fame full brand awareness is the number one arbitrage so I've built my brand as a
 biz dev machine sure well I'm glad I can inspire you and let me know if you need
 a goalie I might he's got a whalers Adam scared
 thank awesome hi Gary hey Rachel you have a name tag I got so excited okay I'm
 Rachel wow that was like cool for a second then it wasn't so I'm the mom of
 two young daughters they've got a third on the way and it's awesome being a
 parent is obviously quite challenging as an entrepreneur you talk a lot about
 what you were taught through entrepreneurship through your dad's mistakes
 and successes and you've had a lot of success as an entrepreneur so for your
 you have two kids right I do what are the three main things that you hope that
 they get out of life and how are you gonna instill those three principles into
 them the biggest reason I'm obsessed with entrepreneurship is it's the clearest
 thing and most obvious thing to me that allows you to do the following which is
 do what you want to do today right like being like waking up and being able to
 do whatever you want to do is incredible so the only thing that I want for my
 kids like from that standpoint is the ability to do what they want to do every
 day now what scares me about that is they're probably gonna have that no matter
 what because they're gonna inherent extreme wealth so much so that I've
 really been having feelings I used to make fun of Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in
 my head of like you're gonna donate 99% of your money until you know it's
 funny you talk until you live right now I'm like I don't want to give these kids
 like because because rich kids have a huge disadvantage because when I wanted
 Sega Genesis in 1989 my mom's like cool go get it right you know like when I you
 know when I wanted to go to a Knicks game I had to sell baseball cards and sit in
 the you know like top row Carmelo's coming over my Hampton's house to play
 with Xander like it's up so I I don't know what but here are the things I give
 a number one more than anything and I will kill them murder go to jail they
 have to be kind kindness is the most important number two if I ever see them
 even in calling even a in your window even a subtle little joke of imposing my
 and my wife's wealth on somebody else because they think they're part of that
 I'll break their neck and then number three I will not raise them in the
 political correct environment we live in now they know there is no such thing
 as fourth place trophies or participation prizes now if they want to be
 nonprofit you know look they're gonna look at daddy's mountain and I'm like
 that or they may be do what I do you know my dad's things seem big mine's gonna
 be a lot bigger but like other people have made it bigger than me and kids
 have done this they're gonna look at that and they're gonna say that I'm
 going the other way I'm building schools in Afghanistan or they're gonna be
 like I'm gonna climb that mountain I'm gonna stick it to big mouth I don't care
 I don't need my kids to be entrepreneurs I just need them to be as lucky as my
 mom I got these in F's every immigrant got good grades in the 80s there's a
 couple people a little older here there was no entrepreneurship school good
 school that was it my mom spit spit in the faces of all those parents that
 made fun of my D's and F's and gave me air cover to be me and it really worked
 out not only for me but the world became it right if my kids want to paint in
 tomato sauce I will back them to the earth's end as long as that's really why
 they're doing it not because they're doing something to like run away from
 some of that nature so just blind support as long as they're kind and the
 last thing I want to say is I'm gonna buy the Minnesota Vikings so I'll see you
 Super Bowl in the owners club no no Super Bowl Jets Vikings 20 47 I'll see
 you there
 again my question is about time time so you're an angel investor in a hundred
 companies you have books and a 800 person agency and a family and there's it's
 unreal to watch how much content you're putting out how do you choose between
 the thousands of startup pitches you're getting in the which which interview to
 do or which speaking back to you it's just so much 100% blind belief in my
 intuition
 I stand you know this and you and bring everyone's hustling right like
 eventually you lose right like eventually time you don't have enough time to do
 all the opportunity so you're crippled by opportunity you just have to go that
 route otherwise you're just gonna spend all your time thinking about the process
 of making the best decision and you know and you're in a waste being able to
 do four things which would have included the two things you've been debating for
 the last day so just the belief in my intuition and then and then lots of
 making fun of yourself this one's a perfect example I have to like it's
 talking about time my my son has a birthday now because he's an August
 birthday I didn't realize it was like this Saturday like and I think it actually
 came after we booked this but like like all the money and from this talk is
 going into the I was originally gonna go to Seattle now I have to take a private
 plane not to miss the play like I just did up and the whole day I'm just complaining
 I'm like I'm an idiot so like you're not always gonna make it right like you're
 always gonna like play micro macro but I think everybody's saying no everybody's
 saying no to cuz they think they're being thoughtful or they're smart like
 you know many people are saying no that aren't even fancy enough to say yes
 yet so I just say yes man a lot thank you yeah hey hello hello great to meet you
 to me to be part name Frank J love it how are you Frank J very good thank you
 brother and I want to appreciate you and your dedication your consistency and
 your communication we own a company called International Tribe Design where
 we bring a style of communication which is very simple but yet rare in this
 society which is honesty and authenticity and I feel like you embody
 this and I feel like a lot of us entrepreneurs well at least for me it was
 like shall I present myself strategically or authentically yeah and what I want
 to ask you is the first by the question what do you think sells more or
 influence more people authentic honesty or strategic marketing near and
 linguistic programming communication I think in the short term it's a real
 battle I think either could win I think in the 30 year macro the radical
 candor authentic way always wins uh-huh and what do you think you know what I
 mean yeah and the thing that people is a lot of people can win on strategic you're
 being very politically correct like a lot of people can win a bullplay it out
 for four years get out of the game with their chips and win not a lot of people
 can though but then once you know of one of those examples it sounds exciting
 because it's a load easier and what do you think the future is for collaboration
 first competition so what we're all about is collaboration let's bring us
 all together I think we can all do great things as I think I think both will work
 right like competition matters right like I want to destroy whaler hat I want
 to kill I want to kill Vikings girl like you know like like competition matters
 right like I'm not good like like zenning this all out but I'll tell you like in
 real life droga 5 let's just put it even in black and white droga 5 David
 droga phenomenal businessman has an incredible agency he's gonna get his
 let me tell you one thing that a lot of you are making mistakes because you're
 saying behind people's backs you can't stop winners from winning
 winners win so something I don't remember when it became obvious to me but
 it's unbelievable if I see a winner I'm like she's a winner it's binary even if
 she's taking David Droga winning in my world alongside VaynerMedia right I'm
 pumped I'm happy for him because if you're also a winner you're gonna always eat
 winners win a lot of people see somebody is a winner and they're not there yet
 or they feel like they're taking away from them and they're talking and really
 all that's doing is exposing where you're at like it's unbelievable when you know I
 hang out with a lot of people you know like people start yapping a little like
 I'm like winners win right and so unless you're doing something really not
 noble or things of that nature's winners win and so I think that I
 collaborate with other winners who take from me complex and you know vice and
 these are when they're gonna win yeah you're not gonna stop a winner and so
 keep that in mind I think that's something that does hold back this
 competitive driven hungry demo more than you might realize envy is stupid it's
 just not practical it just I just don't spend any time I'm like why I don't know
 awesome yeah for sure hey Rob Gary great to be here with you man
 seriously it's been about three years since I've been you came across my my
 Facebook feed you were talking to some millennial kid and you just owned him
 and you just had me hooked from that moment but yeah a couple things so you
 talk about I apologize I'm I'm really anti the downplay of like millennial kids
 like and I don't think that's what you're doing but I just figured I put it on
 film like like I'm 42 there was plenty of lazy losers entitled when I was 22 - like
 this notion that millennial like millennials are first and foremost
 dramatically better human beings than the other generation it's actually not
 even close and you can't be mad at them the market this is nothing to do with
 millennials and over parenting this has to do with economics the last nine years
 have been phenomenal we haven't had a crash how many people here are under 29
 raise your hand you've never tasted the game when it was hard you've never been
 punched directly in the mouth yet you don't wake up like I did an April 2000
 and the market collapsed and every invoice and every order is over you don't
 know what it feels like when the corporations that want to give you ten
 thousand dollars for a selfie don't spend money anymore it's a little harder to
 be an influencer when there's no cash in the system so I'm not mad at millennials
 I'm mad at people's not understanding of why you know they're awesome human
 beings because they're far more well-rounded and they just had a good and
 that's not their fault we could have had that I got into the world in New Jersey
 2000 got done 9/11 got it on 2007 got done so I've tasted that so just keep
 that in mind and by the way the reason I told that story is please keep in mind
 that the economy has been phenomenal for the last nine years like a lot of the
 good is coming for you because of what's happening at a macro level you're just
 average I'm being serious and I'm not saying that to razz I'm saying that to
 make you reflect so that you can step up your game so that when the
 ravage comes you don't die so good you got a little zing that your average but
 now you can actually stay alive and not go work and go back to business school
 sorry bro no that was gonna take it on that course but so you talk about how
 companies are kind of behind the eight ball on on the whole social media
 Facebook marketing it's how it's it's a good value right now do you you're
 starting to see that trend diminish and and that when you see you know that being
 not a value Facebook as soon as math against and art combined to not be
 valuable like on television meanwhile Super Bowls the best that anybody here
 it's got 20 million thrown around run a Super Bowl ad this year the problem is
 there seven it's only seven for the ad which is phenomenal but the network
 makes you buy some other to where it gets up but Super Bowl is an incredible
 value I don't know I'm stunned that these big companies that I work with still
 question it's ROI want to run commercials and billboards it's it's so fun to watch
 them all go out of business over the next 20 years they deserve it I can't
 wait seriously last thing is is you mentioned political correctness and you're
 your kids which is awesome and I think that's what everyone loves about you is
 you just say what's on your mind and I think we can all take a page out of that
 book or just being sure honest you with this crazy climate of you know the whole
 you know the Google guy that that got you know fired from there the whole ESPN
 thing like how do you how do you see this political correctness and what do you
 do to mitigate that in your company so it's a really good question and it's a
 really tough one couple things number one said something the other day that
 finally articulated how I feel about all of it which is I sit in front of my
 people so there's only one place in my life where I'm not logical or practical
 American football right like against all data I think that you know the
 Patriots are cheaters and and Bill Belichick's a terrible guy and even though
 Tom Brady's like clearly and I've like literally spent money on investigative
 journalism he's the nicest human being ever I still say things like yeah he left
 his pregnant wife for gisellies a piece like I will do anything blindly I
 I'm I've chemical like even talking right now the chemicals in my body are
 different I feel it I hate them so much I I really I really want Bill Belichick
 to die like I don't even I don't you you know it's funny I wonder if people
 think like I'm going for like I want it so cool we've established that right
 I'm clearly irrational over emotional not logical and just the worst version of
 myself in that one narrow place if you I mean there are people who are fans of
 me who DM me or have tweeted that I'm a bag I mean I yell at children I'm a
 game's I'm I'm not joking you know how people get beer muscles you know that
 term you drink and you want to fight I have sports muscles like I go to a game
 and even though everybody would probably be able to beat me up I want to fight
 you because it feels better than feeling the pain of your team beating mine right
 like a week ago I realized holy that's how blindly everybody is now about
 politics you're either red or blue and you deploy no logic no rationale you are
 blindly emotional you've no idea what you're talking about and that's it you
 don't need you were about to turn every issue into a how the is climate a
 political like what are we doing here so I have a huge office in New York in LA
 84% of my employees are liberals 84 right and so I have liberal points of
 you all day long the thought of hating anybody or disliking another human
 being for any reason other than maybe being a patriot is insane to me insane
 to me insane to me but I have clearly you know Republican put like an eighth
 place trophy is why China is gonna shit on us with such a big and dump that will
 never be able to breathe again how I handle it is by one by one one by one
