 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing secrets podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 [Music]
 Alright guys, I have to get excited like that every time just to keep you guys awake
 If you listen to somebody else's podcast and come to mind, hopefully that'll wake you up
 So I'm here in the office kind of background and we filmed a bunch of cool things here
 This week with Operation Underground Railroad for those who are gonna be fun hacking live
 We're gonna be premiering in documentary, we've been working out with them about how they're saving kids from human trafficking and it's
 an amazing emotional
 Cool things, I'm excited to show up with you guys, but today I want to talk to you about something else
 The title of this podcast is gonna be
 Drive your kids to work now or not to work to school. Driver kids are school. Obviously some of the agent of kids and that's okay
 I'm not just saying
 This is like a thing driver kids of school, but it's like a metaphor of a bigger thing so
 I'm pretty busy as an entrepreneur. I have a lot of things happening between
 Our companies 150 plus employees
 55,000 active customers million subscribers
 And a lot of other stuff all going on that like we have to keep up with right and it's crazy
 And if you watch any of my stuff, you know
 They're everywhere all the time buying ads trying to be super aggressive in our marketing because we believe what we're doing
 And what we're saying the fact I saw some of it yesterday. Oh today
 Or my Instagram ads said something like
 Russell or said Russell you're trying to artists here as everywhere makes me not want to buy anything from you
 You need to chill out or something. I was like chill out are you kidding me like I'm a man on a mission
 I'm trying to change the world here. I don't have time to chill out
 So I'll chill out when I retire someday here, but right now
 It's important and I'm pushing hard and it's because I believe what we're doing
 And I believe it's not just like a financial thing
 I believe it's bigger than that and you guys know that who listen in you don't believe my you understand what I believe in my mission
 All those kind of things, but I'm sure today is
 last week
 I have my kids and one of my kids didn't want to keep taking the bus to school and he was kind of like
 Just a lot of kids in the bus don't use good language the bus driver's kind of a jerk and stuff like that
 So I started driving them to school in the mornings
 Which was really cool and then a couple times
 We have a nanny that comes in the morning
 So she started driving and I was just like watching that and I remember one morning last Friday or something
 I was like making myself a drink and mixing my powers my pills into my big morning routine crap that's so important right
 I'm gonna talk about morning routines and I watch
 Brandy who's amazing human beings. She's our nanny
 Take my kids and drive to school and I was like I'm I'm missing that experience with my kids because I'm too busy
 Doing my morning routine or whatever it was right and so Monday came and I said
 I told bone and down my twins. I was like hey, I'm gonna drive to school today
 I'm gonna start driving from now on like really I'm like yeah
 So I jump in the car and I drive them and it's not a very long drive
 but it was so cool because like
 And I pick one of their friends in the morning
 And so like I listened to them talking to friends and like and I was like this cool thing where I had this intimate
 glimpse inside the real world like we see the world our kids when we're
 You know when we're at our home and stuff
 We don't see it like them with their friends and like just getting this really intimate cool glimpse of like wow
 That's that's what's happening at school. That's what they're really talking about
 I just sat there like quiet trying listening and that was the first day and then it was if I got home and then
 Aidan Ellie they there's the bus stop, but it's like it's like literally a two-minute walk from our house
 I mean that maybe a one-minute walk, but they usually get a ride when it's snowing cuz whatever so AIDS like you took them to school
 He'd take me to school and he's so cute. He's my little seven-year-old and I was like yes
 I'll take you to school so I've been dry so I get home and I drive them to school
 And so I did that Monday and then I did it Tuesday Tuesday
 I was like okay, I'm gonna get these kids in good state for school
 So I picked him up and music blaring and like got them all excited got him a state, right?
 and then and just every day this week I've been doing that and
 I'm taking Ellie and Aidan as well to school and it's crazy. It's only been a week today's Friday. So it's the last day of the week
 I'm doing this process and I was like I
 was like how
 Like it was it's been so cool
 It's morning
 I don't have the way I came in and my kids like way more connected me
 Ellie's like hey, can you make me a pop-eye egg dad?
 Which is kind of a thing we make and I was like yeah, so I made that in the down
 Hey, daddy make me one too
 So I made him one and Ellie came and had me comb her hair and put it in a little ponytail and like and I took the kids and it's like
 So much more connected to my kids and then I got home my wife was like way different than normal like
 It's funny. I'm always trying to impress her with all these crazy things we do and she doesn't notice it and that like this taking my kids to
 school like how much of a profound impact that had on her and
 It's just special and cool and like so grateful
 I figure that now and not you know four years from now or five years from now when the kids are about to graduate and they don't
 Want to me to be around you know and so I just want to share with you guys because first off it was just special to me and
 It was really cool and something I'm gonna keep doing
 But second off I wanted that to be something to share with you guys because I know again everyone's situation is different
 So me doesn't have kids driving in the morning, but but concept like what is it?
 What is it that you're you're doing right now in your business?
 You're morning routine or something where like the most special things to you
 You're not noticing them you're missing them
 You know I look back at the last few years. I probably missed a lot of that
 I could have drive my kids to school a lot over the last few years and I missed it
 And luckily now I've fixed that way and like I'm so glad that it was earlier than later now
 I have you next few years to really have that time with my kids that I was missing out on but few
 What is it is it a spouse is it a kid is it a family member is it?
 Someone else you love and care about is it?
 Project you know you should be doing it like what is it?
 What is the thing that you're missing because you're so busy doing your thing and
 Just recommend to stop it and look around a little bit and don't miss the moments because this last week has been really special for me
 and it was because
 Last Friday a week ago today that I noticed it I stopped and long enough to notice it and then luckily I listened to the voice in my head
 And and I did something about it
 So look around listen to the voice in your head here. Here it says and then do it
 And see what happens so hope it helps somebody I guess stuff
 He knows I apologize if I sound funny, but I hope this helps you guys. I know it's been a huge huge help for me this week and
 Literally is gonna change the trajectory of my life like that little shift is gonna be huge. So
