 Hey, what's up everybody? This is Russell and I want to welcome you to some special episodes of the marketing seekers podcast
 To me has know that the two who are the big two marketing?
 legends in our space if anyone you know who knows you just sit down like who would you see if you could see like
 The ultimate fighting like a like a smackdown of the greatest marketers of all time
 Who would they be and I think arguably you'd have to say that the two greatest are Dan Kennedy and J-brand?
 I love those guys. I've learned so much from them. I study them
 I like they're amazing and while obviously over the last year I've had a chance to really get to know Dan Kennedy a lot more
 Jay, I don't know quite as well and
 recently Jay actually had me on a
 coaching call with some of his clients and
 It was really cool because you know obviously I've learned from Jay a ton
 but this time he went and he interviewed me and asked me questions and
 The interview was about 90 minutes long and I asked him afterwards like this was really good
 I'm like can we use this can I share with my people and luckily for me and for you he said yes
 and so
 this is gonna be broke up into four different episodes and
 You're gonna have a chance to hear Jay when I'm asking questions and I get responded it was so much fun
 It's such a huge honor and hope you guys get a lot of value from it
 You'll see it's interesting when Jay does the interview he'll ask me three or four questions and tell me to answer whichever one I want to and so
 It's kind of interesting interview that way, but from that came some really cool things
 so
 Anyway over the next four episodes we're gonna break up this this interview and this first one some of the questions that
 I have a chance to answer from Jay or things like where I get my entrepreneurial drive
 And I talked about my very first infomercial ever saw I talked about bridging old-school marketing into digital marketing
 We talk about potato guns and Google Slaps and upsells
 And a whole bunch of other really cool things we talk about building leadership teams and a players versus B players talk about disc
 Test and personality profiles how to hire the right people and this is just the first 22 minutes. So
 Anyway, it was really fun interview
 I hope you enjoy the first of four episodes here on the marketing series podcast with Jay
 Ram interviewing me about business and life and a whole bunch of other stuff in between
 So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast give you the answer. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 This is a privilege for me and I'm gonna with your permission Russell and here
 I'm gonna take it down a number of paths because I think Russell's career and his ability and his knowledge and
 expertise lends itself to not just sharing
 Expert ideas, but I'm sharing a mindset and showing you how to take your business from where it is to a higher level
 Think bigger scale and do things so you need to know that Russell and I think and Russell this
 I'm gonna explain this but everybody I made D. D. So I'm gonna explain it and also have a
 Parenthetical comment to Russell is that I believe
 Entrepreneurship is seen by a lot of people when you're young when you're 15 16
 I used to buy and sell bicycles. I did all kinds of things and Russell. You were an entrepreneur from what 16?
 Yeah, maybe before that actually yeah start really young
 So what I found interesting about your career was that you you you applied and studied almost every
 business opportunity offer out there on TV in the magazines direct mail to see what they were doing
 And how they did it you want to explain real quickly even going back what the drive on that was
 Yeah, it actually started so I was probably 14 or 15 years old and my dad was watching late night TV one night
 And usually he made me go to bed for that night
 He didn't and I remember
 when the news got over and then some of the TV shows then an infomercial came on and I never seen that before and
 It was a guy down the pre selling how to make money with little tiny classified ads and as a 14 year old
 My eyes got this big and I was like I can't believe this is possible
 And I remember it was $40 to call on the phone and buy the kit and so I begged my dad for money
 He told me no I had to go earn it so I mowed lawns for next four weeks
 $10 a week mowing lawns saving up my $40. I remember I wrote down the the phone number and then after I had my $40
 I called number that night and I put it in and I ordered the how to make money kit and it came to me
 And that was the first thing I'd ever bought in my entire life
 It was the first thing I'd ever you know any kind of marketing I'd ever seen and I remember getting the kid in the mail and reading it
 And getting so excited
 But I was a 14 year old kid
 I had no money to actually buy ads or even place classified ads or anything and so but I was kind of hooked and so I started
 Learning and started finding here in the States
 There's a magazine called small business opportunity magazine and I got that magazine
 I called every single 1-800 number and order their info kits and
 And I started getting direct mail every single day as a 14 15 year old kid
 I was getting stacks of direct mail
 I'd read the sales letters I got obsessed with it and so that was kind of how I first
 Started learning this I saw people doing it to me and I got me so excited
 And then fast forward later in my life is when I started thinking oh I could I could do this with my products and my services
 And that kind of shift and transition to that
 And and to put it in perspective everybody listening and watching so Russell was on the
 On the very precipice in the beginning of when
 Digital marketing really exploded he was on the cutting edge and I'm going to pre
 Assume that a lot of the direct response
 Methods that he learned in the mail order methods which are direct response
 He was able to adapt and adopt to all the things he started doing online. Is that a reasonable assumption?
 Yes, in fact, I remember making that like bridge in that connection
 I was like I make email is just like direct mail and I remember thinking website or back then blogs blogs were just like the newspaper and
 Podcasts were like radio and I was like making these connections and I was like I can do the same things here
 But I don't have to put a stamp on an email. So this is gonna be cheaper
 I could actually do it while I was in college
 Yeah, completely just kind of modeled what I saw over here and used it over on the online platforms
 Yeah, I'm gonna ask another thank you and I'm AVD so if I don't acknowledge I heard it
 So bear with me because I've never had the privilege of interviewing you and I'm doing it as an advocate
 But I'm also a fan so one of the things I think is very important and I used to do it at my expensive seminars
 I would actually walk people through the progression the hierarchy of
 Experiences that I encountered to get to wherever I was at that period of time
 So they would understand the lessons I learned and how they would apply
 to anyone either directly or through adaptation and if you let me can we go through some of the like let's consider you a
 Supersonic jet taking off the 40 or 50,000 feet
 Altitude but you're going through these different these different phases of progression you mind going through some of them with us
 Yeah from the very beginning
 Think would help we have entrepreneurs of all kind but many of them use
 Digital marketing social media marketing you understand a lot of things
 I'm gonna bring you very quickly to sharing some techniques because your
 Knowledge is probably well ahead of theirs and it can be a great gift
 But also I think appreciating what what brings somebody to where they are makes people
 Embrace what they share with a lot more a lot more
 Authenticity and a lot more belief. That's just my belief. Yeah
 for sure, so
 The first time because I learned all I'd seen those things when I was a kid and the first time I
 Ever like decide I'm gonna make my own product. I'm gonna sell something
 It was actually I don't know if you guys have these where you're from but I'm from Boise, Idaho
 Which is like potato capital of America?
 And so one thing we do for fun is make potato guns and I remember at the time I was in college
 I was wrestling my university in fact
 I just got back from wrestling tournament where I was a rest in terms this weekend
 I still rust I gotta cut open eye because of it
 but I was dressing for my university and
 I just married my wife and so we you know
 I was trying to figure how to help support her and pay some bills and that's when I had this idea as like we're making potato guns
 I wonder if if anybody else would want to buy
 Information on how to make potato gun and that was my first big idea I first had and
 So I started doing some research and I found out at the time
 They're out 18,000 people months searching for information on potato guns
 And so that was gonna be my first idea
 So remember my friend and I went and we got a video camera and recorded ourselves going and buying the the PVC sprinkler pipes and cutting
 Them and gluing together and then you know making an actual gun
 And if you ever seen for they're like seven or eight feet tall and you jam a potato in one end of them
 And then you spray hairspray in the back and you kind of put a cap on the enemy click a button
 It makes a spark which shoots the potato out like a hundred yards a lot of fun
 So we went made one we filmed ourselves making it and then we put that on to a DVD and that became a very first product
 They ever created and so back then 20 years ago when I did this
 It's the first only really advertising platform. There's on the internet was Google and so I went to Google
 I started buying basic Google ads and I was spending
 I spent about five or ten dollars named Google ads and from that I still wanted to DVD
 So I'd you know make it spend ten dollars and maybe make 30 or 40 dollars
 And so as a college kid that was that was great
 You know I'd making $20 a day net profit every single day and it was just it was it was really really cool
 And then for those who have been following digital marketing for the last 20 years the very first
 They call it the Google slap the first Google slap came and what they did is they changed their algorithm and they increased the pricing and overnight
 I went from spending ten dollars a day to make forty dollars a day to I started spending fifty or sixty dollars a day to make
 forty dollars a day and within you know a week of that I was like this is not working. I'm losing money
 I got to figure something out and
 I turned all the ads off and I thought that I had you know
 I thought okay digital marketing doesn't work. It's too expensive and then I had a friend who had a similar business to mine and
 He told me he said the problem right now is that you're just selling one product
 He said you have to think more like McDonald's McDonald's has upsells
 He said you know when you go through the drive-through and you order a big Mac
 They always say you want fries and a Coke
 He said you need to add an upsell and you can make more revenue from every person who buys your DVD
 And I was like well
 I'm selling a potato gun DVD like like what kind of what can my upsell be and he said well
 What do people need immediately after they buy your DVD right you sell them something so all the problems
 So I sold them a kid on how to make it how to make a potato gun
 The next problem has they had to go drive them by the pipes and the glue and all the things they would need
 So he said well
 They make the kit like create a kit and sell the kit for an upsell and so I actually found a partner who was making potato guns
 And we partnered together and for two hundred dollars
 He would ship them out of potato gun kit and so then we came back and I turned my ads back on and it still cost me
 $50 to sell a you know $30 DVD's if I was losing money
 But then like one out of three people would buy that upsell and all of a sudden I was I was in profit and that was the very first
 You know we didn't we didn't even know what to call it back then nowadays we call it a funnel
 But it was the very first time I'd ever I'd ever created something like that and I remember I was just like I think we figured something
 Yeah, this is a big deal and obviously the potato gun market is you know really really small
 But I said could we do this in other markets?
 And so I found people who had like I had a friend who had a speed reading course
 I said okay
 We just have a speed reading course is creating upsell and downsell we did that his business and it blew up
 And we tried it with the dentist who had a thing we created it and we made upsells downstairs and they're their business
 Bloop and we started applying these principles to tons of different businesses and all of them had little
 Little tweaks and changes we needed to make to make it work in their their industries
 but that's kind of how this this concept this principle of funnels was born at least for me and
 The next decade in my life. I was just doing that for my own businesses for other people's businesses
 I was doing some consulting where I would go into a business
 And I would just go and you know apply these these principles these these funnels and we watch these businesses explode and then
 About man eight or nine years ago is when we had the idea to build software
 And I think some of you guys are familiar with our company click funnels
 Which is software that makes this this funnel process simple
 But that's kind of how it happened
 It was you know us trying to figure out how do we solve our own problem?
 Then we solved it and then eventually we should create software to really simplify it for for other entrepreneurs as well
 You're being very very humble, but you also are known for your mastery of all kinds of digital
 marketing and techniques and you also have been very masterful at
 Growing or scaling. Let's take both of those topics and break them into discussion
 I want to ask a simple question. I think will help everybody because very few people know
 Mentally, they don't have the mental construct. They don't have the strategy
 They don't even have the self-belief to go from little to bigger to bigger to expand
 Can you talk a little bit about the mindset?
 Yes
 It's funny because I've I've had friends who told me like oh wish that I could just have my own click funnels company and
 Depending perspective and I don't know the size of it means businesses here
 But you know we have 400 plus employees or almost 200 million dollar company and so it's big
 It's it's heavy and I always laugh I said if somebody would have given me this it would have crushed me initially
 And I think that one of the I mean
 I believe business is one of the best personal development
 Environments in the world because you have to learn so many skill sets you have to learn you know how to create a product
 How to write copy which is persuasion right you have to learn how to manage a team how to how to how to hire a team
 How to find people how to scale how to like there's so many things you have to learn along the journey
 And I think that what's interesting though is that luckily we don't just you know some doesn't have since 200 million dollar your business in day
 One you have this chance where you try you start growing then you know it collapses around you
 But then you you increase your capacity and you get a little better than you try again you try again
 And actually one interesting thing I don't know if you ever knew this story
 We were click phones about a year old and actually got a text message from you and you invited me to go speak at an event out in London
 In London yeah, and so what's crazy is we'd been around click phones been around for about a year at that time
 We had outgrown our infrastructure and the software kept having these glitches and things were happening and
 I jumped in a plane and with my family
 We were you know disconnected for however long the flight is and when I landed and I connected my phone back up
 there were
 thousands of text messages from all of our customers and people and click phones have been down for four or five hours and
 You know I know what to do. I was so scared. I'm like what do we do like you know
 I've never this is my first time being a CEO
 I'd never had this kind of opportunity to let alone all these other people where their businesses relied on mine
 My business was down their businesses were down and it was interesting because people in that situation aren't very nice
 And they were angry at me and they you know it was it was hard and I think by default what I wanted to do
 Is I wanted to just ignore it or blame somebody else or do something and and I sat in my hotel with my family?
 I was like hey kids get a sit over here for a few minutes. I gotta figure this out
 And we're sitting there. I was like I have to I can't hide this I need to like come out
 And it's not okay that we're down like I'm upset there. They're upset rightfully so and so I remember I did a Facebook live
 From the hotel room in London going to our entire audience all of our customers all for everybody and I said this is what happened
 It is not okay. It's not acceptable like my businesses down your businesses down when you trusted us
 And like I took ownership even though I was so scared to do that and took ownership of it
 I told what was happening. I kept updating him and over the next couple hours
 We finally got the platform back live and from there
 We're able to transition to get things stable and you know it's been great since then but it was it was a scary moment
 It was my first time ever like having this pressure of everything and it's like how do I how do I do this?
 And I want to run and hide it was like no
 I have to I have to step into that to be vulnerable
 I have to share what's actually happening and what's crazy to me still to this day
 I was expecting that we'd have you know thousands of customers cancel or leave during this this window and
 We didn't see any decrease in cancellations in fact after I came forward
 I was vulnerable I told people what was wrong and I apologize
 People rallied behind us. They were like part of our team and it just transitioned to everything
 And so that was like the first time as a leader
 I had a chance like to feel that and it's like okay
 This is the this is moving forward. This is what you know what we need to be we need to be vulnerable as a company
 We need to show we have problems
 We don't hide and we talk about them
 We put them out there and it transformed the entire culture of our of our customers our company and everything
 And so those things happen all the time as you know as you're as you're
 It's great. It's a great story. I didn't know it. Did you end up at least having a good experience after that?
 Yes, my kids loved it London. Thank you for setting that up with a great time
 It was it was it holiday time. I thought it would be really beautiful there. It was yeah, it was Christmas time
 It was like right for Christmas. Yeah, that's fun
 So let me ask you this and I'm gonna get to your your your specific business
 Accumant but you introduce something that I mean my observation because I've been involved in the Japanese entrepreneur market for 20 years and
 I believe that the idea of leadership is something that could be really
 Profound if you'd share whatever you've learned about leading as you scale and about hiring
 great people and about
 Enabling them to be great
 colleagues
 collaborators
 Maybe non equity or equity partners, but just some some random thoughts that you think have had a profound difference
 And an impact on your success and will continue to have that impact just to share not just management, but again leadership cultural
 Beliefs things like that that I think would really be a godsend to be very helpful for a lot of these people
 Yeah, I can think of two or three that might be helpful one of them that
 When we first started hiring people, you know, and that's not something that's natural to me
 And I was very very scared and so I think by default what at least for me
 I think a lot of people a lot of entrepreneurs
 I know the first thing is like they're trying to get a deal on people like well
 How can I lower my labor cost and and we started that way for the first probably weaker - and it was just it got really really hard
 Like we couldn't get the right people they couldn't stick they couldn't figure things out
 And then we had this thought like what if instead of hiring people that we can afford what if we hire the best people in the world
 It has made positions as possible and I remember my business partner who's the developer who built click funnels
 He found an article to something like an a players worth
 I think was like 2,000 times more than a B player and I was like that's true
 I don't know if it is not but if that's true it means one a players were 2,000 B players
 So I was like how about this what if I had four or five really good a players who are just you know topnotch the best in their industry
 And bring them in and then have them kind of manage each their own divisions
 What would that look like and so it was scary at first because to do that you mentioned equity like a lot of times
 We couldn't get an a player to come in for just like a salary and we couldn't afford their salaries anyway
 So we said okay
 Well, I don't have the best in the world and we're gonna give them a little equity or give them some profit share something in there
 But by doing that we were able to recruit our first our first handful my first man seven or eight nine people that we brought in
 We're all rock stars and each to them. There are people. I didn't have to micromanage
 I didn't have to like they were all had a vision of what they they want to do individually in each of their departments
 And so they were then able to go and create and do their things while I was able to do my thing
 Which was so good because I'm not someone who's great at management
 And if I would have had to like shift and learn and become master managing people
 I don't think I would have had nearly as much success as we have but because we brought the right people initially
 It was it changed everything and so that's one that was big
 the second one that I
 Learned probably I probably four or five years as our cliff funnels journey was
 When we used to hire people I would get a resume from somebody and I like to get video res me
 So I make a video
 Send it to me and I can see if I like your energy and if you're if you're a good fit
 And so I would get these these you know I get a hundred applications. I watch all the videos like hey
 These are the five or six people I think I'd really like to work with and I had a coach that I worked with and I
 Sent her I sent her a bunch of these
 These videos that these people want to hire. What do you think and she looked at them all and she said these people are all just like
 You these are not the right people for the for the roles and
 She said what I would recommend doing is step back and instead of hiring based on like how well you get along with somebody
 you should hire off of personality and
 Which I never understood that at all and she said I wanted to do a test
 I want you to go back to all these hundred applications
 We got and make them all take a personality profile so either disk or
 Myers Briggs or whatever you know there's different different personality profiling
 I did the disk test which is one that we hire off of nowadays how to take the disk test
 I actually learned from Tony originally Tony
 Was one of the got me into disk so we gave him the disk profile took it all and then we said okay for this specific role
 What is the personality profile that we need for this person to be successful?
 And so we figured out exactly what that person only looked like and then we went back through all the resumes
 And we only pulled out the people whose whose personality matched what we needed
 For the role what was interesting is that none of the people that I had selected earlier made the fit and my coach
 told me she said of course they did she's like you pick people who are just like you she's like you don't want
 Somebody just like you and your company like they're good at sales they're charismatic like those people sold you on a video
 But they're gonna be horrible at the job
 It's just like the person that's gonna be ideal is gonna be you know from a diss if you guys know disk you understand like for the role
 I need an SC not a DI and so
 Anyway, we end up doing that we got the the SC's in there and none of them want to do a video interview
 They were all awkward and they've all been rock stars who've been us now for four or five years and changed everything
 And so we started coming back and instead of just hiring based on resumes or personnel
 You know who we like the most we figured out for each role
 Like what is the perfect?
 Personally profile of this person and then we apply the first thing is the person on the profiles if they match
 Then we go to resumes and interviews and things like that
 That's great and tell everybody because they're not familiar all with the disc and what an SC is just tell them
 But before you do that also just for your information
 And I'll give you a little minutiae little factoids Tom Phillips and Bob King who were the
 collaborators in Phillips publishing back before Agora was big they had a philosophy
 Hire the best and cry only once
 That's so good. It's very true and and also you get you get you right whether the multiples 2,000 times better
 20
 You get so much most people don't realize Russell that the biggest the biggest underperformance we get in business
 Is not really just our marketing. It's not our advertising. It's not our lead conversion. It's not our failure to
 Get greater lifetime value. It's we don't
 Get optimal
 Performance out of our team part of it is we don't hire correctly and the other part is we don't train and develop correctly
 You could talk towards any of those or none of those
 Yeah, no, I 100% agree and I remember we did that so my goal that wanted
 You know before I was trying to how do we pay the last how do we pay less taxes?
 I was like said I'm gonna change my mindset like I want to have 10 people on my team who max out the tax bracket
 Like and that now becomes a goal and a vision and also it's like how I pay people more and then they start working harder
 And then like it changed everything as opposed to like how do I have a lot of how do I not pay?
 You know, it was like no, I'm gonna get 10 people we're gonna max out the tax bracket all 10 of them meaning that they're all gonna
 be paid, you know million bucks a year more and
 You get a handful people would make it that much they have ownership them were likely to show up
 They're gonna do more and take so much pressure off of you after to be the visionary of every single thing and that was a
 You know for me that changes that change everything if I love that cry once instead of crying a lot
 They're more motivated to see you grow and prosper than even you are oh
 For sure and it's nice because like
 again
 When when I was in London everything went down like I'm in the airplane and they're up there pulling you know
 All my hair is working getting everything up because they're best as well
 Wasn't just like well, this is Russell's company like when he lands we'll figure it out
 They're like no, we have to make this we had to figure this out
 They're just as invested as I was it and man, so nice to have you know if I'm gonna go to war
 I want to see people who are invested with me not just me being out there
 Hopefully the people are you know gonna gonna back me up. Love it. It's great
