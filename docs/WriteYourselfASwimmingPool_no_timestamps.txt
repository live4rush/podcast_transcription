 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast today. I'm streaming to you from the Tesla
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, so I got a Tesla as all excited and for the most part is pretty cool
 I'm like I'm not like a car guy
 Typically, but the Tesla is pretty cool except for the fact that this is the third time now
 Where I get my kids all the way to school and then I push the falcon doors from the come up and kids get out and the doors
 Don't come up. They're just stuck and it's like obstacle detected. It's like there are no obstacles around here
 They're like well, we can't stand up and so then the kids have like pal the windows and stuff. They're super embarrassing. So
 You love musk you screwed me
 Where's my kids in front of their own school again? Why do you do that?
 Just make a car that knows there's no there's no obstacle there. Anyway, I digress what we hear today to talk about
 I want to talk about something that I think it's kind of fun to talk about
 Hopefully gives you a good mindset shift
 I actually had a friend yesterday who messaged me and he's like trying to figure out a way to make some more money and
 He's trying to buy this house and want to money for now payments and stuff like that and
 And I messaged him back and I was like I think you're looking at this differently and I said
 Dan Kennedy who you know probably the person I quote the most on this podcast
 He he used to always say he's like if you want to buy some things
 They send the send the bill to the herd if you listen to any candy stuff. He'd always refer to
 Like your your list you're following your tribe your people whatever as you're heard
 and
 He'd always say yes
 You if you want to go buy this thing then send to try it send the bill to the herd
 It's what he manages like he'd have an idea for something he'd go
 Can't want to go buy this new house this new car or a vacation or whatever he's like I'm not gonna pay for that
 I'm gonna send the bill to the herd. So what's an offer I can create I can send out there to the herd
 They will buy it and they will bear therefore fund the thing I want to actually get
 And so I remember hearing him say that way back in the day
 And I used to always think that every single time I wanted a new thing was like well send send the send the bill to the herd and
 It's funny because we'd call it my first first first
 Got married. I guess we were in our
 I'm probably made a year maybe two years at this point
 And this is about the time that I'm learning this whole internet marketing game
 And I remember because it was Christmas time and she wanted these new couches that were like I don't know three or four thousand bucks
 And I was like oh my gosh like I'm unemployed. I don't have a job
 I'm selling some stuff on the internet hustle and everyone's well
 But I was like I don't have money for you to buy this couch that she wanted
 But you know I want to be able to buy it for and so I remember I made this little promotion
 It was during Christmas time and I called the Grinch sale and it it was like I
 Told a little story about the Grinch and it was hard group three sizes and cut up with this little sales page together
 And I put together a really good offer and I remember in the offer I said you know what?
 One of the one of the lessons about copy is like to justify why you're doing something
 So in the copy I was like the reason why I'm doing this insane sales because my wife wants to couch
 settings like 3600 bucks or whatever it was and my goal is to have this promotion pay for it and then
 You know whatever and that was kind of like part of the reason why I was doing the sale and I did the launch
 and
 It was crazy because I think we sold like
 I can't remember my numbers, but it was like 36,000 dollars like ten times what we were expecting
 I had never made that much money ever
 It was just insane. I remember people buying it and they sent me a letter like I hope you either
 Why you wife that couch and like I don't even want to say I just wanted to help support you and get your wife to the couch
 And I was like what this is crazy
 All these people that bought the thing to help support my wife getting this couch
 and I remember it was funny because I because um
 After after we did it I was like kids go buy this go buy your dream couch
 And she's like that's a lot of money
 I'm like I'm like it's just an email away
 Hun like we just send email out to the list and it paid for it and I learned that that was a really bad thing to teach her all those years ago
 because ever since then
 Not always but every once in a while when I like we want something crazy
 She's like well just send the email to your list
 Because she's learned you just send the bill to the herd
 Another another really fun story that kind of relates back to this
 From the Beatles like Paul McCartney
 It was funny. They said that he says to John Lennon be said at one time
 Before you I believe I think let's help and I might be wrong, but um
 Before I was telling he said hey let's go write ourselves a swimming pool
 Because he wanted to build a huge swimming pool
 But obviously couldn't didn't want to pay for it and so he sent the bill to the herd he man the son of Shani Mays
 Sorry about that you guys
 Anyway, so he said let's go write ourselves a swimming pool and sat down that wrote a song and then launched it
 And it made enough money more than enough money to pay for the swimming pool. Okay, so what was the lesson?
 He sent the bill to the herd so this this lesson this podcast episode implies a couple things number one is you've got to have a hurt
 If you're not folks and building a list and building a following and building a tribe and building people like that's that's problem number one
 We're talking about that for a long long long long long long long long long long long long time many many many of our podcast episodes about
 Listbuilding and folks and building your tribe and the expert secrets book is all about that
 So if you haven't doing that like that's the first step you can't send the bill to your herd unless you've got a herd
 You got to build your tribe you gotta build your people up. So that's that's the first
 Part of it the second part is like shifting your mindset to that so like oh I can't afford that
 It's thinking how can I afford that well if I make an amazing offer provide a lot of value
 I can create something awesome that my list will like and then they will finance the thing I'm trying to get
 And that becomes a symbiotic relationship between you and your your list you provide the value
 They provide your money and and they're you're able to kind of get whatever it is you want my life and remember
 Before moving this house
 I think I did an episode on this was probably way back in the archive somewhere if I can't remember off the top of my head, but I remember
 I want to buy this house and it was a couple million bucks and I was just like it's so expensive like a down payment was gonna be
 Whatever it was gonna be it was at the time was just like crazy and so I was like
 You know, I'd if I created a hundred thousand dollar offer and I sold five people that covered the down payment
 And so I went and and put together a hundred thousand dollar offer
 We pitched it we had a bunch of people to take it and that paid for the down payment, right?
 And so it's like it's it all comes back down to that like alright
 I've got a following got a herd you got a people got a tribe got whatever you want to call them, right?
 Kennedy calls it a herd which I don't think is as
 Appropriate, but that's Kennedy for you. In fact, it's funny
 They they used to do they had a day at their super conference called a herd building day
 Which was how to build your own herd how to build your list and I believe they had this this company buy them
 I don't know seven eight years ago and the company was like
 Very politically correct
 They went through all the courses and they tried to pull out things that they thought were disrespectful and they heard building was like
 disrespectful is they pulled out of all dance courses, which is insane because that's like him and his personality and who he is and
 What he teaches people, but I don't know why I told you that story
 I it comes down to political correctness fact as funny as I'm writing this new traffic secrets book
 The editors wanted me to pull out the word tribe because I can say and talk about building a tribe
 Because I guess apparently that's offensive to some language or some people or something and it's like
 It's just funny now
 So it's always caveat and preface when you say something like this might be offensive some people
 I apologize in advance which cracks me because there's like six books on the New York Times by selling this right now
 They have the word the F word in the title. It's like you can tell people to go F themselves, but don't tell them that
 That they're part of a tribe. I don't get anyway. Sorry. I'm back
 All right, this is one of those days you guys all right, so
 With that said send the bill to your herd
 That's the moral of the story
 Build a tribe if you don't have a yet start building it and then figure out ways to send the bill to the herd
 be creative what kind of offers can you what kind of things can you make for people what are the things you can go and you can do and
 And as you do that and provide value for them
 They'll provide that provide value back to you and you can literally write yourself some people by creating a new offer
 all right, I
 apologize
 Not in advance. I apologize if I offended you guys from this episode. Hopefully you learned something and I'm gonna go before it gets
 Too much further down the rabbit hole. Thanks everybody and we'll talk to you soon. Bye everybody
