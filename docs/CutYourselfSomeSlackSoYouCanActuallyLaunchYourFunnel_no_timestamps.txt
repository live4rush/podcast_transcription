 Hey, hey everybody, this is Russell Brumson. Welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast
 I'm still on my drive home from the two comical bags meeting. I got one more exciting fun thing to share with you
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answer. My name is Russell Brumson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, everybody this is part two, that's not part two is a whole separate episode
 But I'm still driving home from the two comical bags events going fire so excited
 And just had some more cool stuff shared to you. So
 What I want to share with you guys right now
 Because it's I know it's a blocker for a bunch of you guys and hopefully this will release that block inside of your mind
 And I'm seeing right now inside a two-comical club ex coaching program
 Which is why I wanted to bring and then in fact
 I was just on stage 15 minutes ago and I shared it this with them and I wanted to share with you guys as well because
 it's
 It's it's something that that
 so many entrepreneurs
 like
 And if I can just make this shift in your mind and make you like take some pressure off of you
 I think that a lot of you guys will be able to do what you're trying to do and create what you're trying to create
 So the biggest problem we have as entrepreneurs is like we see the vision what we want to create and then we have
 Horrible impatience to make that thing happen, right?
 And what I told the group I hear I said it's been really fun to watch everyone's progress
 But people who are blown up really really fast people are moving slower by it's like I won't I at least you're looking around
 Those you guys who are moving slow
 I don't want you to stress out and be like oh I'm moving slower like I'm having success yet or freaking out because you know
 I'm not a millionaire yet or all these things that you know
 I'm not in the two-coma club yet another people are and like I'm trying to get that process
 But it's going slower for me and like all the different reasons that we have right and so
 what I wanted to
 what I wanted to
 Just to think about is if you think about the real world right so what happens in real world
 We decide that we want to make money, right? So what do we do we go to college for four years for some people?
 Six to eight years for other people ten years for other people and during that time you make zero dollars
 And all you're doing is you're learning a craft that will someday make you money
 Hopefully right and then when it's done then you go and you go into the schooling and you have this like huge debt and you start working
 And you may spend the next five to ten to some people 20 or 30 years to pay off the debt of the student loans
 So you're you're you're good 20 you know anywhere from five 10 15 20 years in before you're like
 Making good money right after you paid off debts and you've actually done the time
 And I see the oh and that's for you just to have a regular job
 Well, you're gonna go show up each day clocky and do your thing clock out and go back home
 I said for all of you guys in this room here like do you realize like what your vision is like what you're trying to do like
 You're trying to create businesses and companies and like products and services and things to change like literally to change the world
 of the customers you're serving right and I said some of you guys are frustrated because you're four months in and you're not a
 Millionaire yet. You haven't had to come along yet, right?
 I said put in perspective like most people spend five years in school to get a job
 It's gonna make them 50 60 thousand dollars a year
 And you're coming in trying to make a million bucks in five months and you put in four or five months of effort and you're frustrated that you're not there yet
 I see it's put in perspective like don't be stressed out like the the most fun part of this process for you
 Is going to be the journey?
 I can tell you that now on the other side of this journey where you know
 We've built companies had success made a bunch of money like and I look back at the good old days of building the business and being the trench
 And learning all these things the first time I have in the aha moments
 I'm like oh my gosh like those aha moments were so exciting for me and I miss it
 In fact, it's a huge reason why I'm so involved in the coaching programs like why I do what I do?
 Why do I write books? Why do I do Facebook live? So I do podcasts?
 Why do I do events like why do I do all this stuff?
 The reason why I do all that stuff is because like when I see you guys get that aha moment like I remember what I felt like
 It's the next best thing to having it originally
 So I feel jealous like I'm honestly jealous of you guys every time you I hear from you
 They're like oh my gosh Russell look I just realized this thing
 I just had my first success or maybe my first dollar my first thousand my first million like I'm jealous
 Of those times because I remember what they felt like they felt so good
 Okay, and so the next best thing is like helping you guys to fill that's that's why I love doing what I do
 Um, but the journey is the best part my wife and I were joking the other day like we've been married now for uh
 We said our 16 year anniversary
 Um, you know and in that time amazing things have happened. We started completely broke
 I was wrestling not with a job. She had a job and then we spent the next you know 15 years of our lives
 16 years of life now getting to this point right now
 And like we talked about the fun is like the most fun times
 Where we were so broke like we were like taking my wife's CDs and selling them at the record store to buy groceries
 And then like we were trying to figure things out and like the apartment we had it was so small that there was no room for
 um cover or drawers to put our clothes in so we bought cinder blocks at uh
 At home depot to like jack up our bed to put it on cinder blocks so we could like store our clothes underneath there
 And we were scared that if we moved the bed too much like our whole bed would fall off the cinder blocks and crush our clothing and all of our supplies and like
 You know like painting our own room because like we couldn't afford a painter
 So we bought a bucket of paint and some like cheap five dollar paint brushes
 And we spent you know like a day painting the room like some crazy colors because we thought it would be cool and
 Like not having money for groceries. I can remember the first thing I sold on ebay
 I sold it for 20 bucks and taking that money and like going out to dinner and like buying dinner for 20 bucks that we actually had extra and like
 Like those things are so much fun. Not the lifestyle fun now like we love it like
 But like those times were like the special ones right like all those moments of the journey of like trying to figure the stuff out
 I'm like me having an idea when we create something and then thinking it's gonna make much money
 And it doesn't and get shut down like I could tell you story after story after story like times
 I thought like okay, klett we made it like money's coming in yay
 And then like two days later, I'd be like oh my gosh. I turned out what I created was actually legal
 I'm refunding over their money like like don't spend that money like it's not actually ours
 And like I can't tell you how many times I went through stupid things like that
 Yes, I did create things that were really really good ideas
 That then I found out where legal later and had to give the money back like um, I think most good ideas come from
 From that. I mean, I think most illegal activities were like really good entrepreneurial ideas
 But then the government was like, uh, that's like not actually good
 And you know, there's a reason why this could hurt other people and they set up laws around it and it becomes illegal
 But most part they started really good like really good entrepreneurial ideas, right?
 And so um, I had those and I had like
 Man like it was painful like so much pain in the process in the moment and all those things like
 The ups and the downs and the excitement and the depression and the the tired nights and the excited things
 I'm learning things I'm learning other things than like every step of the journey I have to grow and stretch
 And like fill your capacity get get bigger and bigger and then like and then things break and fall apart and like
 You know hiring hundred people and firing 80 people and then you know, like
 Like as much pain as I was looking back now
 It's like oh, it was really good old days
 Like that was the journey and and I love that part of it
 And so I don't want any of you guys being so stressed out about the outcome that you're not enjoying the journey
 Because the journey is the best part you're getting to the end of it and you're like, huh
 That was it. You'll get used to the common club award
 I handed you on stage and you're like like for five seconds
 Like this is the greatest thing in the world you eat a pitcher and then you go to a hotel room that night and you're like, huh
 That was it
 But then you'll think back about like well like think about all the stuff that happened in the journey the people I met and the
 Experiences and the ups and the downs when I learned now I grew and like how I struggled but then because I figured I
 I moved past that struggle when I figured out and like and like those are the pieces that you'll cherish you remember
 For the rest of your life
 Um, and so gave yourself time. I guess that you're you spend five years to eight years to try to figure out how to do a simple profession
 We're here inside this world of entrepreneurship. You're doing a lot more than that, right? You're figuring out
 How to how to create a product how to structure and offer how to do sales copy how to create stories how to
 How to create a funnel how to design a funnel how to get programmers how to
 How to drive traffic how to set up ads how to spend money how to like fulfill and how to do customer support how to
 Like there's a lot of pieces to this. So cut yourself some slack. It's gonna be okay. Like if you don't make a million bucks by
 You know next month, that's okay
 And some people will move faster and my with most of those people who are like now I hit I hit two comic club in a week or in
 10 days or you know, we have all these people hitting records now like it didn't just happen in seven days, right?
 It happened on the back of them spending years trying to master these other things
 Like for me if I said I want to make the two I want to hit the two comic club with a new offer
 Like I could do that. I could spend a week and hit the two comic club within a day or two
 Like that's not like but I've done it a million times right like I've gotten that that spot where I where I can do that
 So it's not that hard to do and you guys will become the same way but for right now
 It's like don't stress out like there's a lot of stuff you're learning like a lot of things you're growing through
 Like imagine this if if you get a real job you go to five years of school to
 I don't even know to become a teacher right and you're teaching a subject
 So you got to be able to regurgitate back out of a book a topic that you read right?
 And that's like you're on a five years of school to be able to do that
 Okay, and obviously good teachers do more than that but I'm saying like
 Any job pick a job say I went to school for this much time to be able to do this one task
 Right like what you guys are doing to build this company is a lot of tasks
 There's a lot of things that not and some of them are left brain some are right brain
 Some of them you're building a team which means you have to learn this whole other thing
 And like there's a lot of stuff you got to figure out and you got to learn
 So like I said just take the take your foot off the the gas
 A little bit and just be proud of yourself because most people won't do the journey
 Most people just don't don't take it and um
 And so I think a lot of us will get burned out because we're so stressed about the goal and the outcome
 And we're not hitting it we're stressing out and freaking out and you throw our hands in the effect
 I got someone on instagram
 Oh the uh the other day
 I don't really look at my other messages
 But I looked at my other messages as he was in there in the sky but made this post and I was reading it
 And
 It made me laugh because it was post he was like
 I'm in college right now. I'm stressed out because I've been trying to do this thing for four months and and like none of
 It's working and this whole thing's a scam
 I think you can scam me Russell because I spent four months trying to create a webinar and it's not working and an
 I'm paying 97 bucks a month for click funnels and like I don't have a funnel yet and blah blah blah
 All these things and like I think this is a scam
 Is like you make it sound so easy how you're a dumb kid and you make a hundred but you have a hundred million dollar company now
 Like it's not that easy. I'm like dude. You've spent four months
 Four months and you're pissed you have made a hundred million dollars yet four months
 Like you will never have success because you're so freaked out about this end result like
 Dude in four months if you can figure out right a really good headline
 Like that's that's an accomplishment and then you can go take that skill that um there's a dude that he actually wrote the subtitle for um
 for x-ray secrets book and um
 He charges a hundred dollars for a headline
 And you may be like hundred dollars for a headline like yes
 He does and literally I said my hundred bucks for a headline
 He wrote like ten different variations and said it to me and that the subtitle for the x-ray secrets book
 Which is um
 Find your voice bill to try but change the world like that was the one that I was like that was my favorite one
 And I paid him a hundred dollars for that headline right
 So if you spend x-4 months mastering headlines
 Then going like I write headlines for people and it's like you can charge people a hundred bucks for a headline become a master
 That one thing
 Right and then you pick the best headline person that you start selling headline services for people and start getting really good at that
 Right as you're learning the next skill the next talent and then reinvesting that money into the next thing right
 But don't be like I haven't built a hundred million dollar company yet. I spent four months wrestling angry at you
 It's like dude like it takes four months to figure out one skill. So become amazing at that one skill
 We are in the very near future going to be launching funnel roldex.com
 Which is basically roldex of people who are doing one set one piece of the funnel right
 Something to write a headline for you or can do a video sales letter for you can do a graphic design or logo design
 We'll write the email sequencer they can do like the one piece
 Okay, and my goal is to get all of you guys a master piece and then go become a service provider inside of the funnel roldex
 And then do the one piece you're really good at and then take that money and reinvest it in the other 10 pieces
 You need to launch your funnel take that money invest in someone to do the copy and the traffic and the other things
 Because that's what businesses it's not about us to make amazing and all these things right
 It's about like learning a piece and then like providing value which gives you money
 Which you can reinvest in other people who provide value you can eventually create the whole picture. So
 anyway
 There's there's some stuff
 Out of that helps or not, but I hope that that takes some of the stress off for you guys
 It gives you permission to like enjoy this journey because it's really fun
 And I tell you what I know what you feel what you feel like sometimes
 I know the stress the pain that all the anguish all those kind of things that felt it. It's real
 um, but I promise you it's worth it and um, it'll be the stuff you remember like remember that time you remember we were like
 so stressed so depressed it's so tired so angry and so
 broke and so whatever and
 And you'll remember that and think those were those are the good old days. I miss that stuff
 And so right now you're living it. Don't don't miss it. Um, enjoy it
 And uh, I promise more you enjoy now
 Um, the easier the process will actually come as well. So all right. I'm home you guys. I appreciate you all an amazing day
 Um, and I will talk to you again soon. Thanks everybody. Bye
