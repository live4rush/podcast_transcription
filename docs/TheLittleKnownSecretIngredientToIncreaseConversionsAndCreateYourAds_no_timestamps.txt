 Hey everybody, this is Russell Brumson and welcome you to the marketing seekers podcast is a late night
 Drive and I'm excited to be hanging out with you
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital?
 We're spending money from our own pockets. How do we mark it in a way?
 But let's us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain
 profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brumson and welcome to marketing seekers
 Everyone I hope you guys are amazing today or tonight remember you're listening to this
 It is 11 o'clock at night and I am driving back to my house and I just want to recap the last couple days of my life
 Because they've been a little bit nuts. So
 But exciting and hopefully there's some cool lessons will come for you guys from this so
 number one is
 last week had a chance to go speak at
 Justin Williams
 Flip hacking live, which is very similar to funnel hacking live
 He may have funnel hacked me and then just changed it from funnel to flip, but I will allow him to act because he's awesome
 So they did that and I had chance to speak to a whole bunch of real estate investors
 Which is a different audience obviously all entrepreneurs. I believe he used to click funnels
 This is a group of people who had never
 Done funnels at all and like anyway
 It's interesting because I took my normal presentation
 I tweaked and modified a lot to be more to be better for them
 But I still may have like some some like errors in in what I did
 Anyway, it was interesting learning experience. We still sold well
 But like I I definitely made some mistakes and learned some some cool things
 That I would go back and I think the biggest takeaway from that presentation and for speaking that event
 I think would be good for you guys is looking at like how you how you position your
 Like you're teaching like are you a generalist or you a specialist?
 you know, it's it's
 For me with click funnels and my role in this whole game
 I have to be a generalist right like I'm teaching marketing and funnels for all types of businesses
 Like I there's a lot of my friends who teach like one funnel tie right they teach just trip wire funnels
 Or just hide to get funnels and they like go deep on that and they love it and I
 Envy them because like off I could just that or then I just teaching funnels for dental dentists
 Or just teaching funnels for chiropractors like very specific where they're specialists and I'm jealous that cuz like
 First off this way like I think it's easier because you can like it's not like theoretical like you can think this is the actual
 Funnel that works amazingly well. This is the one you should do this the ad you should run
 This is like you know, they to be a to be a specialist and you can charge more because of that whereas all my teaching has to make
 General, it's like here's this concept and here's how you can use it here and here and here and here and it's like it's way harder
 In fact, I remember I was starting my career. I remember listening Dan Kennedy and somebody asked him one time
 Like if he was to start his career over from scratching and what would he do different?
 He said, you know, I'm a generalist I'm teaching marketing magnetic marketing
 Which is his his thing to like every type of business. He's like if I was to start over
 I would specialize in in just a certain type of business and focus there and
 I was like whatever that's dumb like I would I want to teach everybody because it's the greatest thing in the world
 And I should have heated that advice
 I'm glad I didn't because it's probably hopefully serving some of you guys but man it's a lot harder
 Do we even ten different markets into every presentation I do?
 And then each market has like 50 sub mark anyway, it's it's intense, but that was my
 My cardinal sin I made at Justin Tara's event is I didn't itch it down to be more specific for them
 But not enough and I didn't
 Just wanted to call me head of time and I was like no, I got a deal
 I'm good and I should do the call because I would have understood
 Just kind of the better a better starting point
 So the lesson for you if you're gonna sell something to anybody make sure you get on the phone with the promoter and the person
 Who's invented is and pick their brain to really really really understand?
 The customer and how to serve them. I've done it in the past for some reason I got cocky and arrogant
 I didn't do this time
 and I regret I think I think
 You know, I think I ended up closing between we did a first session and kind of a re-pitch about 20% of the room
 I think I should have gotten closer to you know 30 or 40% had I have
 Customized that presentation better and made it very very specific like okay. You guys as real estate investors
 This is the exact funnel I would use as opposed to what I did was like kind of more general like you could do this
 Or you could do this or you could do this and try to weave together things in anyway
 So there's a rule if you are a generalist and you're speaking to a certain market shift your message to becoming a specialist
 And you'll do way better if you're picking a market right now
 Specialized guess number one so then without event was done then we jumped in a plane and we flew to
 To Salt Lake and then we drove down to Provo because we were putting on our own little show
 and
 So I'm gonna tell you what happened and I'm gonna tell you why we did it because I think
 In fact, it was funny of our last inner circle meeting
 I was talking to how we're doing this big event and I was like, you know, one of my main roles
 I want to get on to B-roll of the cool location cool interview. I'm gonna get sound bites and sound clips all sorts of stuff
 I might look for more B-roll and
 Brian Bird who's a super cool guy in inner circle
 He was like Russell you have the most epic B-roll on planet earth the last thing you need in your world is more B-roll
 I'm like yet we spent like a hundred grand
 I don't know how much this event with the sole purpose of getting more B-roll like and so I should be less than for all of you guys
 So what we did is we rented out this place called the drive our comedy club in Provo and it's a bar
 But it's a drive-ars. There's no alcohol
 But it looks really like the locations amazing right like there's different set you can do this the stage and the light and the ambiance
 Like just looks insanely cool. So like I saw it
 In fact the backstory the Harmon brothers some of the other Harmon brothers own a company called vid angel
 You know that is this an app on Roku. They'll edit videos for you, right?
 So it makes radar movies like PG and stuff and it's awesome
 But then they got in a big fight with Disney and all these people big legal battles
 So during the legal battles instead of like editing movies they
 They start streaming their own content at the drive our comedy club
 Which is comedians who had to do clean comedy. It was awesome
 And so we were watching all this comedy and what was cool is we started seeing these sets and I was like, oh, it's such a cool location
 I want to do an event somewhere like that. Okay, so there's thought number one in my head then I was listening to Andrew Warner
 who's the he's the
 He runs the mixer G podcast and he's like most fascinating interview you were ever me like if you don't listen to make sure
 Do you podcast go and listen to it the sole purpose of listening how Andrew interviews people like it so cool
 And I'm listening to his interviews and he normally doesn't you know at his studio or set
 It's one time he was interviewing some entrepreneur at like a camp around a campfire
 Into this whole interview on a campfire. I was like, oh, I want to be interviewed on a campfire
 I totally quick-fuddled startup story. I'd be so cool. I was like wait a minute
 What if we did it at the drive our comedy club and then they became a thing
 I messaged Andrew and you next to me know six weeks later
 We're the driver comedy club and then I'm like how do we get people there?
 We got to make it fun
 And so that I was like well
 What if we had JP Sears come to comedy at it and so I mess with JP and I'm like what would it take for you just like make fun of me for
 30 minutes before this interview so they kind of loosened up the crowd because it's like I
 don't know
 And I thought it'd be I thought it'd be good like sometimes interviews are tough if someone's having success because they're like
 Oh screw that person. I don't have you know, you like downtown the success
 I was like it'd be more fun if they if people make fun of me for a while then it's like I
 Don't know like when people it's the whole reason why we share like our back story and share like the vulnerable moments
 Right because if you're vulnerable people and you share it's the times that you struggle and you've had like the big losses
 Then when you have the wins people celebrate with you as opposed to like
 being annoyed with you, right and so I was like let's
 Let's make fun of me. It's that way people will be more likely to to have a vested interest my journey
 Be interested in this whole click funnel startup story, right? So luckily JP said yes
 So when all said that my JP come on make fun of me for like 30 minutes that he did some his standard comedy for the next
 1520 minutes was awesome and then we came up on stage and Andrew interviewed me for two hours about the click funnel startup story and
 It was amazing. I'm sure someday we'll release the footage of it
 But we had tons of b-roll and there's somebody sound by some clips and
 It was just super super awesome. So
 I wanted to kind of show that you guys because all the word deal we went through to be able to get the b-roll
 Right and so think about that like if you guys are creating content like you sitting podcasting is good
 But like but like getting the b-roll is even more important and I'm gonna
 Have I'm gonna share more of that here in in a few minutes because it kind of goes to the next level, right?
 So that's the Deborah comedy club in a great time. It was like really special evening. I loved it
 and I think it was helpful for people and
 Anyway, it just for me was that it meant a lot and
 Andrew did an amazing job JP did an amazing job my whole team did amazing. I'll put it together and it was it was awesome
 so then we flew home and
 Like Sunday I got home and then what's crazy is tomorrow is
 Wednesday and I find Arizona to go and speak for two days on the traffic secrets book
 Which is the book I haven't written yet?
 Ah, but I had all that Monday all the Tuesday sit down in front of with my brain and a huge white pad of paper and start doodling out
 All the sketches teach all the core concepts
 I wanted that been thinking about for last year to put inside expert secrets and they doodling and putting that order and
 organizing and reorganizing him and then you know
 I was up all day Monday doing it and then I got over in like a nine o'clock at night
 I was still stressing out still working on it then Steven Larson bested me
 I'm like what would it take for you to come in to the office?
 So he gave me the office and we were there and then I was
 Instagramming me and Steven in there like mapping out things having tons of fun and like Dave was about to go to bed
 And I and then he went and he checked in his stories and saw me and Steven there so he jumped in
 His car and you know jumped out of bed guys closed on drove over to the office and we're also in their brainstorming and like
 Up till I can be into two o'clock in the morning
 Which was laying because I had to wait at five thirty so I had three hours of sleep last night
 Which reminds me why I'm so tired right now?
 anyway, I
 digress so I'm telling you this because I spent two days got all the doodles done and tomorrow flying out to go present these at a live event
 Partially because I'm looking for B-roll footage at the live event to be able to use in the promotional video of the book someday
 and then
 One of the guys that works with us doing video stuff things Blake he was in town and he saw the Insta story
 He's like, oh, I wish I would have known I would have came last night and filmed all the B-roll of you guys
 Mapping the stuff out and I was like, well, what if we did tonight? He's like, yes
 So the where I'm coming from right now is we were back at the office and we spent two hours
 Just filming B-roll of everything we did yesterday
 Like literally me redrawing out the drawings. I did me relaying out the drawings me
 Walking around doing stuff Blake taking videos from inside the office outside the office walking into the office me
 Like as many different spots in different places and we spent two full hours just capturing B-roll
 To be able to use in a promotional video. We do in two years from now when we start selling the book, okay?
 and so
 Why am I sharing this with you guys because most of
 most
 Most of us aren't
 Looking at this as the art that it is right like I can have a video me saying hey my new book traffic series came out
 You should read it. It's awesome or I could like
 Capture the process of creating this thing and showing what happened behind the scenes and how it worked when we had to go through the pain and then
 And like me, you know up all my doodling and sketch these things out laying out over the whole floor
 All these like huge pads of paper and then going to event on stage teaching and explaining people and like trying to help them understand it
 And then sitting down actually writing and footage of you actually creating this thing right like documenting yourself
 Documenting the the journey
 Then someday when you have to sell video to sell a thing like you have all this this magic you can go back in and you can use
 Okay, and so I just want to put out there for you guys start thinking about that like as you're doing cool stuff like don't just capture
 You making the content like capture you
 Capturing the content right like get the B-roll get somebody like as you're writing your book like hey
 Can you get a video camera just like you get some shots of me like writing this book get some shots of me working on my perfect webinar
 Get some shots of me like at the gym losing weight because I'm a teach me to lose weight like all those things
 They matter they matter a lot if you notice most of these are nowadays. It's like 98% B-roll, right?
 And there's like a voiceover storyline talking about something
 But the B-rolls was sucking in the video and hooking you and like pulling from step to one step to step three step four like
 Pulling through the whole process and so um
 Anyway, those are the fun things
 We spent probably more time three or four times more on the B-roll than we do on the video or the initial thing
 We're shooting you know, I mean and so think about that
 Yeah, so
 That's all I got I know this was kind of a random episode we talked about
 flip hacking live just in tears event difference between being a
 a specialist and a generalist and if you are a generalist when you're speaking to special to us to a
 Market to like flip into specialist mode and like change your message because you'll sell more and you'll serve more
 And if you're choosing creamy in general some specialist become a specialist
 Don't become the next Russell Brunson funnel builder next Dan Kennedy marketing guy become
 become the the funnel builder for
 Whatever market, you know, I mean they become a specialist
 and then we shift over into
 drive our comedy club
 JP Sears and new Warner and then all the stuff it did tonight and the emphasis on capturing the B-roll capturing the story
 We talk about documenting the journey and doing that through podcasting like that
 But man if you can get your camera out and like film different pieces even just getting your phone out like film you
 doing different pieces
 That stuff will be valuable someday. I promise you that look back now that my kids are
 My twins turning 13 years old now
 We didn't film it capture much stuff for them, right?
 Because we had cameras back then wasn't as easy and I look at now and like I have tons of footage of Nora and
 Aidan and stuff that but the earlier kids we hardly any footage is like sick to my stomach and
 I'm so grateful now we're catching all this B roll of everything we're doing because like we go back in the archives
 And you know in eight months now in the book launch doesn't be like oh here's all the footage when Russell's actually writing the book
 Like how cool is it to have that and how many ways can use that in the promotional videos and ads and other things
 you know if if you're launching your funnel and
 The last phase is you like creating yourselves video and they're like oh wish me for ads like oh let's think about an ad
 Then you're missing the point, right?
 You you're missing the magic the magic is while you're creating this thing
 You should be documenting every single piece of that because that becomes your ad that becomes the B roll for the sales
 That becomes the storyline for all the things you're doing so help the helps
 Anyway, I'm gonna go to get some sleep. I am not slept enough, but you can probably tell
 Some days my podcast is probably kind of all over the place
 Which sounds like it might be today so I apologize for that
