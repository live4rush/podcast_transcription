 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast today
 I'm going to drop on you some of my favorite books. I'm reading right now
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everybody, hope you guys are awesome, so we're getting closer and closer to Halloween depending when you're listening to this
 Which Halloween was my favorite holiday for?
 Basically my entire life. I went trick-or-treating until I was 21 years old
 And those who are awake we Russell weren't you on a mission when you were 19 and 20 and the answer is yes
 And yes, I dressed up as a Mormon missionary going door-to-door because I already had the costume while I got free candy
 It was a good old days anyway, I love trick-or-treating love Halloween love everything in fact when my kids were born
 I was like this is the greatest thing in the world Halloween was amazing before it's even more amazing now
 And we went trick-or-treating every single year until about three years ago
 Three years ago was when I bought my Batman suit if you've seen
 We launched expert secrets our affiliate prize was to give away these Batman and Ironman suits
 I got my own custom fit it was so cool
 And I was so excited because that Halloween I was gonna be Batman like legit Batman
 And I was in front of the suit and I was just so excited for it
 I remember it was a long day at the office
 I got home as quick as I could and I was trying to get rid of the kids had wrestling practice
 We got wrestling practice and come back take its home
 And I'm getting them already getting dinner because I'm gonna have to race back the offs get Batman suit on
 Which is like it's like an hour-long project to get that suit on I'm so excited
 Feeding the kids about to race back to the office and also doorbell rings and I go the door and it's one of Ellie's friends
 And friends like hey is Ellie here? I'm like yeah, what are you doing here?
 She's like I'm coming to go trick-or-treating with Ellie. I was like what?
 You're like I trick-or-treating with my kids. Ellie runs over oh
 My dad I'm right now. I'm like no you can't and clothes like why not Mike cuz they trick or like this is my my holiday
 You can't take my daughter trick-or-treating and Ellie took off their friends
 She was gone and a few months later the boys got calls from their friends and they're like we're gonna
 We're gonna trick or treating and they took off and I remember I was like I wasn't ready for it
 I don't know it's like the kids leaving home only worse
 I wasn't ready for it and I remember they were all gone and it was it was Aiden and Nora
 and Nora was tiny at the time like maybe
 She's my two at the time and then me and Klett and so I didn't get my Batman suit on
 I'm like we go out to the car and it got caught
 You know got nor sued on everything and put her in the car seat my time
 I got in the car seat she passed out and she was out cold and so it was like aiden me and Kletts we drove to this neighborhood
 And got out with Klett started trick-or-treating and I passed out in the car and that was like the saddest day of my life
 I miss Halloween anyway, I come to grips it now my kids are awesome. They can have friends
 I was just I wasn't ready for it
 You know what I mean like fall Sunday like you're planning your kids are gonna leave the house someday and then also
 They just leave that any preparation
 Anyway, so Halloween was my favorite holiday until that year and now my new favorite holidays 4th of July because I spend more money
 Fourth of July than any sane human and so because of that everybody comes to me and I'm doing that to compensate for
 Halloween being stolen for me, but I can't
 Anyway, that's why I really feel and I'm just joking. Anyway, that's the truth story though
 So fourth of July is my new favorite holiday, but it always was Halloween and so as Halloween gets closer
 I still get excited. I'm not gonna lie
 I love the least falling and the seasons changing and pumpkins and candy and like just all the things
 So anyway, one of our family traditions is every year for Halloween we go to
 Albion, Idaho where there's this old college campus where there's is in early 1900s
 There was a thriving college here and it like in 19
 I don't know 1920 or something it went out of business
 So it's been bacon for like a hundred years and a couple years back these this family bought it
 And they renovated the whole thing and turn it into one of the dorms
 They turned like a bed and breakfast and then the rest of it they turned a hundred houses like there's a zombie house a clown house and it's these old
 creepy
 buildings from the early 1900s and
 Anyway, it's it's insane. So go over here this year. We took two of our friends Rachel Peterson and her husband Paul
 And they came with us which was really fun. So anyway
 On the trip down Rachel Ashton says what are your favorite books you're eating right now?
 Every time someone asked me a question about books. I was like freeze cuz I'm like
 There's so many like I'm obsessed with books
 I have more books than every day
 I know and I buy them every day tons more and I don't read most of books
 I listen most my audio book by the physical book too because I like having physical books and like anyway all sorts of
 turmoil I sat there like a deer and headlights thinking and
 And I kept thinking and thinking and I realized like right now and stuff because you know how it is like different seasons
 you're like there's different books and like all those kind of things so
 anyway, I'm
 Season of my life. I'm actually really excited for I'm preparing not really I'm mentally thinking about my next book
 I think I told you as before my next book
 I bought the domain of bootstrap comms the books
 We called bootstrapped and it's gonna be the click funnel story how we did it
 It's gonna be different because all my other books have been how to books right like how to get traffic
 How to build a funnel how to write copy things like that
 But this book's not gonna be how to this is like the story of it and so I've been obsessed like listening to books about
 companies and
 People telling their story about how they built the company and so
 I've been listening to a lot of those lately just like understand like how to write that way how to tell stories that way
 That's different right it's different than how I've typically done things
 So for me to be able to write this book
 I have to change my skill set and this hopefully is a side lesson for everyone like a lot of times when we had do the thing
 We want to do we have to like
 Do we have to learn something completely different right like a lot of you guys if you've heard business before and you come to our world
 You're like oh my gosh business is different online like we have to change how we think and so for me
 It's the same way like for me to write this next book like I have to learn how to write differently
 And I understand that I respect that and pay attention to I'm trying to learn it so
 Anyway, so I've been listening to a lot of books about companies and about their stories
 I want to hear how people tell their stories and so my three books will recommend to you today
 Are all books about people's companies?
 And they're good for couple reason number one. They're fascinating books number two. They're really good
 Storytellers the way they tell their story was fascinating where I was like sucked into the book and I couldn't stop
 In fact two of these books. I've listened to twice and one. I will probably listen to you again
 I just finished it yesterday. So that's why I haven't listened to twice yet now. It's rare for me
 I don't normally read things twice because I have so many books coming in but both of you know two of the three books
 I have already listened to twice which is a testament of how good of a story that they actually are so
 With that said in no particular order, I'll give you my three books number one book and this one
 I'm nervous to tell you guys about because
 It's like the dark side of entrepreneurship. Okay
 You know a lot of times you hear stories about oh here's how so-and-so built their company
 It's like this positive thing and there's you know ups and downs and trials and tribulations, but for the most part
 It's like it's a positive experience, right?
 This is actually a book about a website called the Silk Road, which is a website
 It's on the dark web that sold illegal drugs and so it's kind of like the negative side of entrepreneurship
 But it's one of the best stories ever
 So the book is called American Kingpin, okay American Kingpin and the premise of it is there was this kid
 He's a 22 23 year old kid who is libertarian and he wanted he felt that people should if they wanted
 You know do drugs they should build your drugs
 They would have to do themselves they should be able to do right and so he kind of talks about a little bit and then he had this idea
 for a website where he's gonna set up a site where people can come and buy and sell drugs on the dark web and
 He'd take a commission of every single so it happened right and that was kind of this this idea
 Now the problem is that he didn't know how to code and it was illegal to make what he was trying to make
 so he couldn't go hire coders on you know and on
 Scriptlands or Odessa who he would
 They like it's illegal so he had teach himself coding they started building the site and it's crazy and
 He like I don't want to ruin the story, but it is it is amazing
 He basically ends a building this this empire and he had every government agency coming trying to take him down from like
 DEA FDA FTC like all of them are trying to like to come and get him and none of them can figure out who he was and so the
 Story is just so fascinating the way it's told
 So good and one of my favorite parts is there's a scene where he's in like downtown San Francisco
 He's walking around he's looking at all of the tech buildings right these huge companies worth billions and billions of dollars
 And he's walking around by himself with a backpack on looking at these buildings and realizing that
 That his company was worth more than any of these buildings
 But if he told anybody about it you have to go to jail like how cool is that?
 Even though everything he was doing was illegal
 He was still like an entrepreneur went through the same trials and problems and ups and downs that we have to go through and so I
 I love this book. It was amazing. It's called American Kingpin
 And it is the first one that I wanted to recommend
 Also the writer who wrote it is I literally like I tried a message and like hey
 We're gonna write my book for me because you are such a good writer
 He at the end the book he tells about how he did it talked about the tens of thousands of hours of research and all the
 Papers and documents and court cases he had to go through to write this book and he went on to say that on top of like him just
 Going and actually writing the book. He didn't just be like oh, you know
 He looked like what was the weather in San Francisco on that day?
 What was the what's happening here happening here?
 It's like when he's telling the the the scenes of the story like it was actually like
 Like what was really happening at the time like anyway, that's it's so good. I listened to twice
 I'll probably send it again. It's that good. I think they're gonna make a movie out of it
 Apparently there's a documentary made about it, but the documentary is like horrible like don't even
 Don't even watch the document about Silk Road
 Just read the book because it is insane and it's worth your time. So there's book number one. All right before I open up to book number two
 I've got a secret message here about
 A cell phone number that I want you guys all the text here in a few seconds

 Audio messages every minute every morning. I give you motivation ideas inspiration. So if you're not on it yet go and get in there
 All right, book number two yesterday for number two number two. It's a book called Lost and Founder and
 This is a book by a guy named Rand Fishkin and I love this book for a couple reasons
 Rand started a company called SEO Moz and
 He he started about same time. I was getting started
 So I had a chance to watch what he was doing and Rand
 He like I have so much respect for him. I think we both look at the world differently
 I think he would disagree with a lot of things. I believe I disagree things he believed
 from like how to run businesses, but man, I have so much respect for him and
 I remember watching because I went the whole bootstrapped, you know build a company through through ads and funnels and things like that
 And he went the other way of building a really good
 Product and raise money and things like that and it was interesting because looking at the outside
 I never knew if I was right if I was wrong like should we be taking on money like what should we be doing?
 And in fact in my book bootstrapped there was this chance meaning where Rand actually came to Boise and spoke in an event
 I showed the event he talked he told the story about Moz had took on money his whole thing
 And I remember listening to story and in my head I'm like, okay
 The next step for a click phone was just for us to take on money and when he got done
 Normally I would leave something like that I'm too introverted and shy, but one of my friends BG right was there with me
 He's like, just go talk to Rand's go talk to him. I'm like, okay, so BJ pulled us up there
 And BG asked him and basically said hey, you know
 Like you took on money like was it worth it like like tell us the real story and Rand was very raw and honest and like no
 Like it ruined everything like it it um
 He went on he's like, you know, he's like I I went suffer depression. He's like I had a quit from CEO
 He's like I don't even have my own car. I don't make that much money
 I just wanted the whole things and remember where he got done telling me this whole thing
 I remember getting in my car and boxing Todd and everybody on my team like we are not taking our money no matter what it takes like and
 He he he literally diverted me from taking on money
 Like it wasn't for him saying that the next phase for click phones to take on money
 And so because that we didn't and it was interesting because like publicly in his presentation
 We just tell him to store about taking on money, but then privately he literally told us don't don't do it
 And I remember always thinking about that and wondering how he felt and after he left Moz a couple years later
 He wrote a book called lost and founder and lost and found us him telling a story in his book
 He explains the dangers of VC money at a level that I have never understood before
 It was like so clear and concise and like oh, I'm so grateful for that book grateful for ran first off for
 Steering us in a different direction, but second off the book is such a good illustration of why and I hope you guys
 Especially my world who were talking about how do you go funnels?
 Bootstrap things like man that book was one of the best to show the opposite side of that what happens we do take on money and the
 Scary the scary side of business that a lot of us are unaware of until it's too late
 So lost and founders in book number two super well written ran an amazing writer
 And just someone I was hundreds back for so that's book number two
 All right, you guys ready for book number three my third and final choice for today my third and final choice for today is
 The book I finished last night, which is called shoe dog by Phil Knight and
 Shoe dog is the story about Nike and I've had so many people who who told me to read this book over and over and I kept like
 fighting it fighting it and finally it was actually interesting
 Dean grassy oc told me I need to read it and I was like, oh, yeah, I've heard that by a lot of people
 He said no, you need to read it for different reason than everybody else and I was like why and I talked about
 You know, Dean and I talk about our kids a lot and Dean and I both have
 Children that we we had but heads with and struggle with sometimes, you know, and he said that there's this part in Phil Knight's story
 we had two two children and
 he said that that one of the kids he never could like figure him out like this puzzle to never figured out and
 They always just kind of struggle said his son would not wear Nike's his son like whatever his dad want
 He wanted to do the opposite and just it was really hard. He said eventually it was son
 I think it's almost 28 years old in passing away in a tragic accident
 And one of the things he said the book he said man if I could do my life over again
 I would have focused more energy on trying to understand the puzzle of my son
 Who am I get emotional anyway?
 And so that was the reason why
 After Dean told me that he's like you should read it because I think for both of us
 He's like we need to spend more time trying to understand our kids that we don't that we struggle with and
 So I said okay, and so I started to read the book and oh so glad I did for so many reasons
 Number one is kind of helped me to understand that and more focus
 on my kids which I think is so important and number two is just a fascinating story of
 The story of Nike like I didn't know all this story how it happened and all the things he went through to make it possible and
 Anyway, it was such a good book and I hope you guys have a chance to read that one as well
 So there are my three books number one American kingpin number two lost and founder number three
 Shudag all amazing books again

 You know ready to build your company or give you ideas for the next steps in your company
