 Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson.
 Welcome to Marketing Secrets Podcast.
 Today, we're going to be talking a little bit about faith and how it relates back to
 your business because people always ask me like Russell, I know you believe in God,
 what does it have to do with your business, how does it tie together?
 So I wanted to share with you guys this really special episode and I hope you get a ton out
 of it.
 So the big question is this, how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure
 capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things
 that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain profitable?
 That is the question and this podcast will give you the answers.
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing Secrets.
 Hey everyone, alright, so this is the deal.
 We have a fan page that has like half a million fans.
 In fact, I've got a bunch of them.
 So it's one of my secret little Ninja marketing strategies on the side.
 This one is a fan page for people who are followers of Duck Dynasty.
 And so I made a video that went out to these guys that was talking about faith in business
 because obviously Duck Dynasty fans believe in God as do I and I shared something there
 that I don't normally share typically but after recorded I thought it was really good
 and I thought it would be helpful for a lot of you guys who try to reconcile God and
 business and how those things fit together and so I want to share with you.
 So I get emotional in this episode.
 It does start me welcoming the Duck Dynasty fans.
 That's why there's some context here not like why is Russell talking to us like we're
 watching a TV show.
 Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode.
 Hope you love it and if you like it please share it with others.
 Thanks so much and enjoy this episode.
 What's up Duck Dynasty fans?
 This is Russell Brunson again and I'm so excited to be back with you guys today.
 After our last show which is all about entrepreneurship we had tons of you guys asking questions,
 leaving comments and private messaging us, asking us a whole bunch of different questions
 and we decided to come back and do another show today very specifically on one set of
 questions that a ton of you guys were asking about which is entrepreneurship and faith.
 Like do they work together?
 Do they not?
 How does this whole thing work?
 And I thought it would be a lot of fun to answer some of the questions.
 So I have the top question you guys asked here and we're going to go through them right
 now and spend some time together because I know so many of you guys have strong faith.
 I have a very strong faith.
 I have a belief in God and in Jesus Christ and a lot of times people ask like do those
 coincide with business or do they not?
 Should they be separate?
 And so I want to kind of give you some of my ideas and feedback and so that's kind of
 game plan.
 So the first question you guys asked was do you believe that your level of success is
 based on your level of faith?
 And I think that's a very interesting question and it's one that makes me I'm almost a little
 nervous to answer that because I personally it's a tough one because you see people who
 don't have faith, you have huge successes right?
 And sometimes I know for me like that was confusing sometimes like well this person is
 not necessarily doing what's right.
 Why are they having all these huge successes?
 Now the time you see people who do everything right, they're following God, they're living
 the commandments, doing all these kind of things and then they're struggling in business
 with their finances, their companies and so sometimes it's like doesn't correlate like
 why those things work together.
 I think my personal opinion is I think that when we're doing the right things God blesses
 us right?
 I've seen that in my life over and over and over again but a lot of times he blesses us
 in different ways.
 We work with an organization called World Heat Trade and about once a year I have a chance
 to fly with this organization out to Kenya and we actually build schools for these kids
 in Kenya.
 I remember the first time I was there I was in this little they're called IDP camps which
 is basically they're internally displaced people, people who the government there's big
 huge war and they pulled these people out and they threw them out in the middle of literally
 of nowhere and said hey good luck hopefully you can survive.
 We came in later a few years later at these IDP camps we started building these schools
 form and I remember the first time going there I was looking at these people and I was like
 oh like what did they do wrong?
 Why are they in this horrible situation where they're lucky if they get one meal a day?
 They're lucky if they're able to survive the summer heat because sometimes they don't
 have access to water.
 I'm like why is God so upset with them?
 I remember feeling that and the second day we were there with these people was Sunday
 and it was really cool because they wanted to do a church service with us and most of
 people they were Christians we all got together and we did this church service and I see these
 people who are like the lowest level of poverty I've ever experienced.
 People who literally don't have a meal every single day people who most of them they don't
 have fathers they have brothers and sisters who are dying around them.
 It's just a sad thing and we met together for this church service and I see these people
 with these like bright the widest smiles you ever see singing and praising God and like
 having this amazing thing and I remember as I was sitting there I was just like thinking
 about the fact that because they were here it wasn't that God was upset at them or anything
 it was like God I felt that God had protected them I kept them away from so many other things
 in the world that a lot of times we have to deal with right we have to deal with the internet
 and pornography and crimes all the stuff that we deal with here in our first world countries
 and I was thinking about these people and I'm like man God loves them so much these protected
 them and so I don't think that necessarily you know our level success is title level of
 faith again I feel like we're blessed but blessing isn't always financial right sometimes
 blessing is not having finances I've learned during the times in my life when my businesses
 were struggling a lot of times is the time where the biggest growth and the times where
 I felt God closest in my life and so that's kind of my beliefs I do think he blesses us
 but it's not always financial a lot of times is from other things and so that's kind of
 my opinion on that.
 Alright question number two where does my personal motivation come from you know I'm going to
 be completely honest and vulnerable initially my initial motivation I first got started
 my very first business was I just met my beautiful wife I fell in love with her I proposed
 to her and we're going down this path and we're going to get married and at the time
 I was wrestling a boy's estate university I didn't have a job she was making nine fifteen
 hour and as soon as like reality clicked in after like we were engaged and we were getting
 ready to get married I was like how are we going to live on nine fifteen hour I'm either
 I have to quit my wrestling or quit you know I didn't like the numbers didn't add up and
 I was like I figured out a way to make money so my first initial motivation was I got to
 make money I got to make money I think a lot of times that's what happens for entrepreneurs
 because like that's the initial need right and so initially I started making money trying
 to start businesses and it took a while but after it started working then it was nice
 because I was able to let my wife quit her job and then I was able to like start building
 a company and then hiring employees and start getting better and there came a point where
 finances didn't really matter to me I'm going to point my life now where like my house is
 paid off like my car is a palryne debt like and so it's really weird when there's a transition
 point where money doesn't really matter to you anymore and so it's like why am I in business
 and why am I doing this why am I working late nights and early hours and doing all the work
 behind this and it's interesting because there comes a transition point I think in most people's
 lives especially entrepreneurs who are going through this where initially it's like I need
 I'm trying to figure out a way to make money so I have freedom I have these things and
 then when you get that freedom there's this shift and if you've read my book expert secrets
 I talk about the shift like there's this shift from growth where you're trying to figure
 out how to grow as a person like financially and get education and learning all sorts of
 but eventually like you get a point where like you can't grow anymore in and of yourself
 right there's there's a point where like you're going to be as good as you are at that thing
 the only way to continue to grow and progress in life is to transition from like trying
 to make yourself better to this concept of contribution was like now how do I help other
 people if I can figure out how to help other people that's how I continue to grow I don't
 continue to grow by getting smarter me reading more books or making more money I get I start
 growing by helping other people and so for me my contribution came from like I want to
 help other entrepreneurs like I figured out this process in this path that then over and
 over and over again my companies how do I help other entrepreneurs have the same kind
 of success how do I contribute to them so they can have the same kind of impact that
 I was able to have because if I can help them feel that same freedom I felt like man that
 lights me up on fire and so I do think that for me my motivation initially was about getting
 myself my life in order my marriage in order so that we could we could survive as soon as
 those needs were met then a transition to contribution and what fires me up today is I look at the
 entrepreneurs we work with inside of our software company ClickFunnels we have over 55,000 customers
 who use our software these are all entrepreneurs who are using our software to get their messages
 out to other people and for me like that's what fires me up in the morning I hear stories
 about all these I can share 100 different stories of entrepreneurs one of my favorites is Brandon
 and Kaitlyn Poland who are in the weight loss market and they teach women how to lose weight
 and Kaitlyn is a great success story she lost a whole bunch of weight and she's able to
 use her powers and entrepreneur to help other women like she lost the way she's in shape
 now and now for her it's hard to continue to grow she can't lose more weight right like
 she's in the spot where her body is perfect the way that it is and so how she's supposed
 to continue to grow she can't do it and by working out lifting more like you don't continue
 to grow that way the way that she started to grow is turning outwards and started contributing
 to other women and right now I've watched as their company last two and a half three years
 they now have over 100,000 women they've helped lose weight and that's that's the motivation
 I have is for me to be able to get entrepreneurs the ability to help share their message with
 more people is how I continue to grow and that's what that's my motivation right now
 all right number three do you feel do you feel your face do you feel you face more temptation
 with higher levels of success okay so I would say 100% true before I had success like all
 my focus was on like having the success when you start having success it's interesting
 like one of my friends once told me said money is just an amplifier who you are and so I've
 seen people in my the last 15 years I've been doing this a lot of times younger people who
 make money really really quickly and I've seen it completely destroy their life because
 suddenly they have the ability to things a lot of times like when you don't have the
 financial means somebody's like you may have desires for things that aren't right but you
 don't have the means to do it I've seen people who I've seen 18 19 year old kids who make
 a million dollars and all of a sudden they have the ability to do anything to buy their
 own houses get drugs alcohol women like whatever they want is at their fingertips and a lot
 of times when they're too not too young but they're not mature enough to handle it it
 completely destroys their life and it's sad I've seen so many people who have that and so
 I definitely think that when you're we start having success it's almost it's almost like
 a double edge sort if you're not careful it can be the biggest curse in the world or
 if you're you're smart about it can be the biggest blessing you can help you to serve
 so many more people and have bigger impact but if you're not careful it's it'll amplify
 whoever you really are and so if you're not a good person if you struggle with the with
 addictions or things like that money's just going to amplify that it's not going to
 make it easier by any stretch imagination if that was true you look always celebrities
 who have insane amounts of money and you see them all happy but instead you see them in
 rehab clinics why because now they have the means to do whatever they want and if
 again money just amplifies your tendencies anyway and so I think a lot of times it's good
 for people to get themselves right so that way when they do have more means like they're able to
 to to do good things with it as opposed to destroy themselves which unfortunately happens way too
 off and we see it I gave a seat in pop culture we see an entrepreneurship but then the flip side
 that you see people who who get the money get the means and then they use it the right way
 like it's amazing because the impact they can have is second to none all right
 question number four do you have any advice for staying grounded humble as you become more
 successful all right so I have a really cool story about this my business has I've grown my
 business and I've crashed it now twice big crashes first one first one was quite as big
 it was probably the most painful though because I because it was my first one and my identity was
 so tied to my little business I was building and I built it up I had probably 30 or 40 employees
 a time the whole thing crashed and I had a reset and I built up a new company I had over 100 employees
 and it crashed again and I remember because I think most of us entrepreneurs were building
 stuff like it becomes our identity like it was embarrassing it was humiliating you know
 it was hard to go talk to your friends your family members you see people at church you were
 asking hey how's business going and you're just like man like I don't really want to tell him
 like it's not something I'm proud of right now but fast forward after my second business failure
 I was actually at a retreat in Mexico with some some entrepreneurs and we were talking about it
 and there was one guy who was very very wealthy he had he had bought and sold like 40 or 50 companies
 made hundreds of millions of dollars and it was interesting we're sitting next to their dinner
 and he was fascinated about my story he kept asking me his questions and you initially what
 a lot of times what we do is we talk about the highlight we're like oh I did this and I did this
 and we're we're proud of it and he kept asking me questions he's like he's like well tell me
 about the tough times like what like what happened and finally he got into me and I told him you know
 I think it was the beginning of late night I was tired so I just kind of broke down I was like okay
 this is the first time that my business crashed and I went into the details and I told him he asked
 me so many questions I went to the pain of it and I talked about the second time I went through
 the pain of it and what happened and why it was so hard and afterwards he looked at me and he
 nodded and said good I'm like what do you mean good he's like I will never work with an entrepreneur
 who hasn't cycled at least once I was like cycled what does that mean he's like he's like cycled
 means that he built something up as a crash he's like the first time someone built something they
 have all the success and so the problem is they think it's because of them and he says they still
 they read their bio and they believe it they're drinking their own Kool-Aid he says until you
 built a company you've crashed it you and he called it cycling which is such a better way than
 saying going through bankruptcy he's like until you've cycled once he's like you still believe you're
 that you are the greatest thing in the world he's like after you've cycled you rise it's not you
 there are other people that made this possible you were a piece of it but there were other people
 there were people on your team there were employees there were customers there was
 inspiration from God there were all these things that happened that made you successful
 and just as easy as you were given that you can be taken away and he says that after you've cycled
 once typically you're more humble and so for me my my biggest advice is know that like you are not
 the greatest thing in the world if you're building a company there's so many external forces I look
 at the companies I've built and a lot of it was yes we worked hard yes we were smart yes we did a
 good job but a lot of it was we had really good timing there were doors that were opened up that
 shouldn't have been there we had inspiration or ideas that weren't from ourselves that just
 somehow showed up that gave us the ability to execute ways that we couldn't have done before
 and so realize that it's not you okay you are a piece of this thing but realize that there's a
 lot more people behind you and if you have crashed if you've cycled if you've gone through bankruptcy
 don't stress out about it that was a gift our founding fathers gave us as entrepreneurs so we
 can risk things and try things and not have you know ultimate punishment where your business fails
 you end up in jail for the rest of life that was true nobody would try to do anything we wouldn't
 have that ability so cycling crashing bankruptcy those things it's a gift from god I believe it's
 a gift from our founding fathers so that we as entrepreneurs have the ability to risk things and
 try things and if it fails we're just gonna scenario you cyclically start over then you can do it again
 and so that's kind of my my best feedback for saying grounded and humble all right i got a
 couple more questions here that i want to go through and these have been fun i don't have a chance
 a lot of time to talk about the religious aspects of entrepreneurship so i appreciate you guys sending
 these questions it's really fun number five did you ever lose faith in your business wasn't
 performing well so this kind of reminds back to the second time my business crashed and i don't
 think i have a lot of faith i know i have friends who have won things of crash they've questioned god
 they've they've been upset or angry at him as well i don't think i ever had that i think i remember
 going through this process and feeling like i had to figure this out of my own and so when so much
 a lot of faith i think i kind of distanced myself because i felt like i had made this mistake and i
 had to fix it and i remember for months going through this process of trying to fix it trying to fix it
 trying to fix it and a lot of times not knowing what to do and being confused and being stuck
 and you got like hitting these walls and just like uh it was like trial after trial after trial i
 remember uh one morning i was getting ready and i just i didn't want to go in i remember thinking
 i had like i wish i had a boss so they could fire me but i can't because i have to like i have to clean
 up this mess that we've created and i have to figure my way through it and i was kind of lingering in my
 my room and i was just taking longer to get out the door my wife came in and she could tell that like
 that i was i was in a good spot and she looked at me um and when she looked at me i kind of just
 i started breaking down and i was just like i didn't know what to do and i was scared and i
 and i still remember this moment it was one of the coolest um one of the coolest moments of my wife
 she came over to me and she grabbed me and she pulled me down to my to my knees and um and she
 prayed with me and she said we need God's help and she prayed that i would know what to do and how
 to do it and um that was this thing that brought me back to to that point and um and it was a
 turning point where it gave me the ability to kind of re-tap into that and know where to go and what to
 do um and um and so that's kind of that was kind of my my experience with that um sorry it's not
 normal sharing some of those more emotional things all right i got two more questions here that i
 want to share um uh the next one was how do you prioritize your work with your faith in your
 religion and so um a couple things first off um you know with uh with me like they're not separate
 um if any of you guys you know you're watching this show now i talk about my faith openly i talk
 about my faith um on my podcast i don't in my books i talk about i don't hide it it's not things that
 are separate um i honestly feel that God has given me gifts not because he cares if i'm an entrepreneur
 cares if i make money he cares that i'm having impact on other people and um i feel like if i didn't
 talk about that it'd be a disservice to him so i don't hide those things they're very uh for me
 they're very much one in in uh one in the same they they work together um and i know that in the
 society we live in now it's scary because you can get sued for talking about God at work and uh things
 like that and it's just um it's one of those things that uh i just think it's it's they they
 they can they should be together i feel like businesses a gift um businesses were created so
 we can serve people we can serve customers um which is what religion is right religion is all
 about service um i look at Christ he didn't come this earth to like tell people how great he was he
 came to serve other people and it's the same thing uh business is one of the most pure forms of
 service i feel and so that's kind of how i i tie them together and then the last one is what is
 your why is it to be rich to retire young to be able to have freedom to serve what is what is your
 why um and so you know i'm gonna spot my life now where i've experienced things um i am rich i've
 retired i could retire like those things don't motivate me if if they did i would be retired i
 would just close down shop we're in a good spot where we could do that um but for me my why is all
 about um the contribution to entrepreneurship i love entrepreneurs i love what they can do i
 know that one entrepreneur can affect hundreds of thousands not millions people's lives in ways
 that i can't do i told you earlier about kaolin pole and with weight loss for women i can't help
 women lose weight i have no idea how to do that i don't know how the intricacies of the how it works
 but i can help kaolin to get her message out to more people if i can affect her and help her
 to be able to share her message she can help a hundred thousand women if i can help um somebody
 else with their message like how many people they impact and so for me my why is entrepreneurs i
 love entrepreneurs i love what they do i love their ability impact change i don't think the government
 is going to change things here in this country i don't i think entrepreneurs are going to do it and so
 i love the ability to serve entrepreneurs help entrepreneurs give them the tools the ability the
 skill sets they need to have legitimate change in the world and so that's it for today's questions i
 hope that helps you guys again thank you so much for letting me be on the show if you have any
