 I'm gonna pick up at the very beginning of the live clubhouse and we'll go from there
 We're here everybody. What's up? This is our this is technically it's the second time
 I've gone live on the platform first time was a huge train week
 We'll talk about in a minute, but this is round two and I'm here and you know for how you filmed today
 I am feeling amazing so excited to be here. I know that we were on for the funnel hacking live room
 And it was bananas. So I know that this one is also going to be amazing. Don't forget to make me a moderator

 Amazing, I'm learning how to use it all
 Okay, can you hear me? Well, this is my first time using setup and everything. I'll make sure you can hear me
 Yes, we can hear you perfectly fine. Welcome everybody welcome welcome
 All right, well, let me well wait for a few more people to jump on here for a second
 I'll tell you guys what the game plan is what we're trying to do here and and and then we'll dive into it
 so we're gonna be alive for about an hour from about an hour and this is
 My second time officially using clubhouse
 I've been in clubhouse a lot as a guest and hanging out but first the same time doing a room first time
 I tried to do a room did not know what I was doing jumped in here
 I left brought everybody up to become speakers and it was chaos and
 Anyway, it was it was kind of crazy. So I kind of have stepped back for a minute
 It's like okay
 I want to do this again, but I want to do this time a little more strategically
 And so the the game plan for what we're gonna do is we're gonna
 I'm gonna basically be doing
 Kind of like an episode of the marketing seekers podcast. So I'm gonna talk for probably 15 minutes or so on a topic
 And then when that's done
 Yennefer's gonna be my amazing co-host helped me this whole process makes you don't mess it up
 Then we're gonna bring you guys up whoever wants to come up and ask questions or give comments or share things that kind of deepen the
 What we're talking about with everybody else and that's kind of that's kind of planned
 So I think it should be should be fun. I think I'm forgetting
 Yes, make sure that you pin some people into this room
 You have that little plus line at the bottom guys as you are hopping on here
 Invite some friends that will be interested in what we're gonna be talking about today
 Which is the secret behind the value ladder?
 So fun
 Alright, and I've also got this really cool
 I feel professional I got a little board here and click buttons and know like if I tell you guys a joke check this out
 Did you hear that?
 That is amazing. So I do that I can like if we talk about money, I can make this oh
 And I also got the theme song for the marketing stickers podcast loaded up here
 So this is the live version of the marketing stickers podcast which I'm pumped for
 Hopefully you guys are pumped for as well
 Like I said I got about 15 minutes stuff
 I'm gonna talk about and then we'll open up the Q&A's and so that is the game plan
 So again if you want to invite anybody you know
 Please invite him and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cute the theme song right now
 And then we'll play it and we come back I got 15 minutes to talk and then open blinds for Q&A's that sound that sound good
 Awesome, let's get the party started guys. All right, that said here is the theme song
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet
 Still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I'll give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody welcome to our first ever official marketing secrets live show
 So excited to be here with you guys and we are doing this live on clubhouse, which is kind of cool
 And so this is my first time really
 Producing something like this and I'm excited so if anyone who is a listener to my podcast
 You know that usually I spend about 15 20 minutes talking about a topic and ends there
 And I want to use this platform as a way for me to be able to talk about my about what I'm thinking about for next 15 20 minutes
 And then when it's finished jump on with you guys and do Q&A and answer questions
 Or if you want to share ideas or thoughts whatever it is it should be kind of fun
 So that's kind of a game plan and the thing I want to talk about today
 we title this one the real secret behind the value ladder and
 I did it for a couple reasons number one is the value out is probably one the least understood
 Principles inside of this marketing game and it's funny because I think when you explain it
 It's really simple and you're like oh I get it
 I get it
 But when I look at people's businesses when they come in for consulting or they hire me for coaching or whatever it is
 I look at it and some people have what we call a value maze was eight million different ways a potential customer could go and
 It's confusing. I'm like well, where like where do you take a customer in and they have all sorts of different things right?
 I'm like well value maze is not a value adder
 So that's kind of one thing or number two. It's like are they have a product?
 I've got one thing and they're kind of missing some of these key components and so I want to share with you guys
 Really quickly what the value ladder is then there's there's a there's a big thing that I think most people are missing and it is key
 It's the key of to to ascend somebody from one spot to the next in your value ladder
 It's the key to actually serve people the highest level of value
 It's the key to really have success and help your customers have success
 And so that's kind of the stuff I want to talk about today
 I'm a geek out on this at a deeper level than I typically do
 Because I'm hanging out with a bunch of people who are on clubhouse
 It means you guys are as nerdy as me if you're here with like five minutes worth of warning that we're going live for marketing seminar, right?
 And so
 That's kind of game plan
 So and then afterwards like I said we're open for Q&A and do some questions
 And if you have any feedback or if you want to share your value ladders and things like that and how you transition people from
 Step-to-step that's kind of game plan. Okay, so a couple of things the value ladder right now is more important than anything
 I could talk to you about for a lot of reasons one of the biggest ones is obviously
 With all of the changes happening and advertising between Apple and Facebook and their feud
 I'm assuming that most years have noticed that your costs per acquisition in most your marketing campaigns
 If you buy ads on Facebook have probably gone up for a lot of you guys have gone up substantially am I right?
 Okay, and so there's a when I if you've read the dot-com secrets book one of the one of the quotes that I talk about a lot
 From my mentor Dan Kennedy. He said that whoever can spend the most money to acquire a customer wins
 Okay, there's something that like I don't have tattoos, but if I had a tattoo it'd be tattooed my forearm
 So I would never forget this is this how important it is right
 Whoever can spend the most money to acquire a customer wins and I remember when I first got started in this game
 I heard him say that and it didn't make any sense to me
 Okay, and I think a lot of you guys who have been you know in the market right now playing this game for a couple of years
 It's been easy
 If I'm completely honest like Facebook ads have made things easy and a lot of people made a lot of money without having to be really good
 entrepreneurs and really good marketers and really understanding
 Things because it was easy. It was easy and if any of you guys had a chance to read my my newest book my third book traffic secrets
 The intro of traffic secrets that the title was there's a storm coming and some of you guys probably read that
 It was a you know right when coronavirus hit is when the book launched and I said, you know
 There's a storm coming like it's been so simple for so many years and I've been doing this now
 This is my 19th year in this business. So I was playing this game before Facebook before my space
 Actually, friendster was the hot social network at the time when I started this game and so
 I've had a chance to see the ups and the downs and watch what happens to advertising platforms and networks over two decades now
 And so I wanted to warn everybody because so many people have gotten this game in the last few years where it was easy
 Where's we focus on Facebook?
 And I'm like you guys have to understand like there's a storm coming
 We got to look at things differently and if you're not you're gonna be in trouble
 And I think or the big the the real first big wave of that has been hitting right now with with the the battle between
 Apple and Facebook and all the things I've seen a lot of people who messaged me who are freaking out
 They're like I had cost of going what do we do?
 What do we do and and the reality is we should do is you should be celebrating
 Okay, if you're an actual market or if you're a funnel hacker if you're one of our people right and you've been hearing me preach
 This now for a decade right whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins, right?
 If you understand that okay the fact that all the CPAs are cost for acquisition
 These costs are going up and it's getting more and more expensive should not scare you to death
 It should make you excited because all it really means is that more and more people are gonna fall out of the game
 Okay, less competition less people less people fighting over ad dollars all those kind of things
 It's gonna drop okay because the real marketers are gonna place keep playing the game and the rest of them are gonna disappear
 And I said I've been doing this now two decades. I've seen this
 I've seen people who are making millions of dollars a month one day and then because of an algorithm shift
 They're now out of business and I've never seen them come back which blows my mind to this day
 It's because they didn't understand these core principles
 And so the core principle I want to drill into your eyes mind today is the concept of a value ladder
 And then I'm sure you guys the actual secret behind the value ladder
 It's the key to makes this whole thing work. Okay, so the basics of the value ladder
 If anyone's you've been around me for any you know for more than five minutes
 You've heard me talk about this before so I'm not gonna spend too much time on the actual value ladder
 Because that part's the most simple but a value ladder is like somebody comes into your world, right?
 And you give them some value so my goal is
 Obviously, there's a lot of free things I do online right my free podcast. I'm doing this right right right now, right?
 So you guys are jumping into this this room
 And this is the bottom of my value ladder, right?
 And it costs you any money, okay
 But I'm providing value and hopefully if I do a good job of it, you're gonna be like man
 That was like that Russell guy he talks kind of fast, but I got some value that was really cool
 What else does he have right and you naturally want more that's the coolest thing about human beings like if we receive value
 It's something we all we we naturally want more
 So if you see a cool video or a podcast or you're here in clubhouse or something you get some value
 You're still looking around you're like hey Russell talked about that book. What's that?
 What's that book you said oh dot com secrets or traffic secrets when everyone grabs your attention, right?
 And you're gonna go online and go to dot com secrets.com you go over there and you're like there's a book at seven
 I think it's 995 shipping and handling you're like whoa in the clubhouse room
 We spent an hour with us now was amazing. Can you imagine what I would get a fact?
 You read his book
 Right you put your credit card and you buy the book and you get the book and you start reading it right now
 You're moving up my value ladder
 You start reading the book and you're like oh my gosh
 This funnel thing is really really cool in this book
 He talks about the 10 core funnels and how they work and like all of a sudden
 I see how it could work in my business and I can see I work in other people's and you start freaking out
 You're like this is so amazing right and you got value
 You're like I paid 10 bucks and look at the value I got from this thing
 This is insane right and then what happens you naturally want more you start looking
 What's the next thing what else is Russell having start looking around and all of a sudden like oh my gosh Russell's doing this
 Two-comic live virtual event coming up, you know in two weeks like I want to be part of that like what is that?
 Okay, and so you go you sign up for the event and um you know and I try to provide value first
 The way that two comic live networks is you put in your credit card and you go through the tired three-day experience for free
 Then afterwards you decide if it's worth it right so it's no like me trying to scam me around money
 It's like look come show up
 I'm gonna serve you like crazy and the end of it decide if it was worth it if it is then you could pay for it
 Not then don't right so they come through to comical to comical live event and they go through this experience for three days
 And they're learning they're growing and they're getting all stuff like this is amazing getting so much value from this
 What else does he have right and then you look at
 Funnel hacking live our big live event or maybe it's our two comical coaching or if you're inside a two comical coaching
 You're like after you've gone through a process like what's next I want the next thing
 And so left you've gone through our two comical coaching program, you know, it's a 25,000
 Our program our next tier up is my inner circle, right?
 And then after my inner circle there's new program coming out called category kings
 And so this is my value ladder
 Right and it all starts with me coming out there and putting out as much value as possible
 And if you like it you're gonna naturally want more
 Okay, so that's kind of the concept of a value ladder and get I don't want to go too much deeper than that because you can read about in the dot com
 Seekers book, but um
 And I've talked about a lot of other places that's the core the core concept I kind of wanted to put out there
 Right and so the reason why as as um, is ads are changing right ad cost are going up and everyone's freaking out
 Um, that's why this is so so important because what will typically happen is most business owners
 And I see this so much even inside our funnel hacker community
 Unfortunately, is they create a product and they have this product and it works really well and they start selling that product and um
 And right now because the game has been easy for the last four or five years, you know, they they spend 50 bucks and ads and make a hundred bucks
 Like oh this this game works right but now with all these different changes and the algorithm shifting in the fight between apple and google and
 And uh facebook and things now these costs are going up when now you're spending a hundred dollars to make a hundred and then it's gonna
 Gonna be two hundred dollars to make a hundred right and all of the amateurs are gonna focus are starting to fall away
 Okay, I remember my very first marketing seminar I ever went to
 I heard mike limin said he said amateurs focus on the front end
 It's an amateurs focus on the front end and I didn't know what that meant
 Right until I started getting into business and I started saying oh my gosh like like my first two or three tiers in my value ladder
 Like i'm all that money is going back into just paying for customers
 Right it's not until tier three four five that's actually making money and the deeper you can go into your value ladder
 Without making any money the more success for you're gonna be right because whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins
 According to dan kennedy
 Who is my mentor and I trust everything in my mentor say to me so uh, it's it's very very true
 Okay, so I want to I want to kind of start with that now the next thing I want to talk about is
 Again most of you guys at this point have some kind of value ladder
 But the the thing and this is where I talked about the real secret behind the value ladder the thing I really want to share with you guys today
 Um, and this is the nugget that hopefully you get and you're like, oh my gosh
 I got value and then we'll open up to some q&a's and stuff, but um
 So that's uh, so the the big secret is each tier of the valuar the thing that you sell at that tier is is got two goals
 Number one is to um provide value, right? It's just scratch the itch they have
 Right so you given this thing that's like, oh my gosh. I got a value that was amazing
 My I scratched my itch, but usually when you solve one problem for somebody it opens up a new problem
 Right so for example when I give you a book I had a great company funnels you like read this book
 I got value and also you're like, oh my gosh. I need a funnel
 And then hey lo and behold guess what I sell I have this funnel software that I sell called click funnels
 You should use it right and so it opens up the next thing and each tier of the value ladder should provide value
 Help somebody of that tier and then and then by giving them that value it should open up the next step
 Right because after you have a funnel what do you need?
 Right? Well for me like you buy my first book. It's like here's how to build a funnel and then second book
 Like hey, here's how to do the messaging for your funnel third books how to get traffic to your fun
 Right and move somebody up and down
 So the first time I got this um some of you guys know chat homes chat homes is um
 He passed away a few years ago. He wrote the ultimate sales machine, which is still to this day one of my top 10 favorite business books
 and um
 Chat actually became a friend of mine. Uh, I spent a lot of time with him in you know in business and traveling and um and just had a lot of respect for him
 And as I was working with him
 He wanted us to help him with uh with one part of their business
 And so because that he opened up his books and showed me his entire business model
 Um, which was which was really really cool
 And so he showed me this entire business model and uh, I want to walk you guys through how it works
 Because when he showed this to me, this is when the first time I got it
 They're like each step my value ladder selling the next thing so the way chats business model worked is
 He runs radio ads, right?
 So he's running radio ads and in the radio ad it would say basically call this number to get uh to get nine free reports or something like that
 So they'd run the radio ads. It would call a number someone answered the phone say hey
 What email address do you want us to email your nine free uh reports to you get an email address cool and said hey
 Well, I had done the line uh chat normally he used to do these seminars that were um three hours long
 He would fly around the country and people would pay uh, you know
 I can't wear a hundred dollars come these three hour long seminars to help them to grow their company and um because your home
 We're doing virtual seminars and how would you like to come these virtual seminars?
 And he said um, you know the seminar for you guys for virtual is $300
 But the cool thing is you want to pay for it at front
 You can come to the seminar 10 the entire thing that after it's over if you liked it, then you paid the 300 bucks
 Right and so that's how chets value ladder began
 Okay, and so that's kind of where I got I got to dive in so I started going on these seminars
 I wanted to understand what he was doing and I watched this uh
 This three hour long web seminar that they would run and they would teach people and coach him and show them all this amazing stuff
 Right and it was really it was awesome three hour training was was worth of 300 bucks
 And so when the three hour training was done at the end of it he said, okay
 Um really quick. I want to find out from all you guys was the last three hours was worth it
 Okay, and if it was tell me and uh, if and if so will bill you, you know
 They agreed upon $297 like we agreed upon but if not, let me know and we won't bill your credit card like totally cool
 Uh, no harm no foul and you go person by person. They'd have these uh, these web classes have like 10 people on a time
 So you go Joe, how was it for you? Was it good and Joe back? Yeah, it was awesome
 And then cool, you know, Sam, Julie, Mike and go through everyone and get everybody to say yes
 And they'd build their credit cards and so okay now that the seminar is over it's officially over all the value got on the value
 Really quick, you know, the biggest question people ask us after they go through this experience is like I want more like
 What's the next step? What's next here?
 And he said do you care if I if I spend a couple minutes talking about our six week long mentoring program where we can take these
 Principles and help you instilled in the side of your business and of course everyone's like oh sure definitely
 And he walked in transition to the six week program and he explained it all and then from there
 Um, he would try to close every single person on the call in the six week program, right?
 And so then that was the next step in the theater and then he went through six week program at the end of the six week program
 Uh, they gave him two bonus calls, right?
 And the two bonus calls with the coach they kind of feel where they're at and where they're trying to get and then from there
 The coach upsold them to the next program to the higher ticket program
 And so each tier in the value ladder provided value provided the thing they promised and the end of it
 There was a mechanism. There was a tool. There was a process in place
 Then took that person and ascended them to the next tier inside the value ladder
 Okay, that was the key and I started watching I was like oh my gosh
 This is amazing and what jet didn't his business. It was really fascinating. This is kind of topic
 But just an idea to put in your eyes head
 Every single person in chet's organization's entire company
 Um, everybody was paid a percentage of the sale
 Um, and so what happened is that the person buying the radio ads, you know, he would get he or she would get a percentage of
 Of the money that came from the webinar one and then from the six week program and all the way through the entire line
 So they all were incentivized a person who sales on the webinar got incentivized when everything happened after that person touched them and so on and so forth and so
 Um, the way he structured. I remember him sitting there. He said he said russell
 This is a secret to business. They don't have tons of overhead. It'll drown you said you got to set up your structure
 So that everybody's paid on based on a percentage of commission is like that way when you have big months
 Everyone gets big checks and small months everyone gets small checks, but we all do it together
 That way you're not stuck with the overhead and things and uh, unfortunately
 I didn't use that and click phone to wish I would have
 I get all 400 employees that work here to i'm just joking
 But it was really just a cool thing
 So this was the secret the value ladder that chet taught me is that each tier in the value ladder
 Um, like part of the product part of the thing that they're buying actually sends them to the next tier
 Okay, and so that there's a good way in a bad way to do this too
 Um, I've seen this in the past when I've bought somebody's book where I'm like I see the book
 The ads awesome I buy the book and I read it and the entire book is like a sales letter for the next thing and I hate that
 That drives me crazy, but if you look at my process
 Um, I want to blow people's mind
 So like if you go through and you watch the you read the dot com secrets book
 You'll notice that the entire book like whatever 297 pages is just pure strategy tactics like nothing
 And at the end of it, I'm like there's a little chapter on on hey if you need
 Uh tool to help this is called click funnels and we we push them to click funnels, right?
 And then there's a sequence after buying the book there's a whole marketing sequence to get somebody from there to the next tier in our value ladder
 Right
 Then um, if someone comes to two comical live event, right?
 It's a virtual event. It's three days long. They go through the process and inside of that event
 That is the mechanism where we sell our two comical club x coaching program, right?
 And so they go through that and they join two comical club x
 Okay, and um in the in the past I had an inner circle and my category kings, which has been closed for about two years now
 But um, I'm gonna I'm gonna sprinkle some hints here. I'm actually reopening those here this year
 Which is exciting
 And so what's cool about it is then people inside two comical bags
 They can then naturally send up the next year and then people inside of uh, the inner circle link can naturally send up to our category kings
 And so there's a process in in place
 But everything is designed and structured around knowing that I got to give them the value
 I promise them but then at the end of it there's some mechanism that moves them to the next tier that moves them up the value ladder
 Okay, and that's the that's the power. That's the real secret behind the values
 Not just having a value out of like oh, there's a product here product here product here
 It's structuring your product so that the product does the selling to move somebody to the next year
 Okay, if you guys come to funnel hacking live, you will notice something most of our speakers not all of them
 Most of them are people who are in my inner circle. They're in our two comical club x coaching program things like that
 And so as we introduce them right. Hey, here's so and so one or you know two comical club x coaching member so and so
 They see this and people see over and over and over again
 That the people who are on stage are the people in the next program higher
 And it gives people incentive to want to go and send up and move up the value ladder. Does that make sense?
 So these are just some of the the things but that's the real secret and value ladder is structuring your products in a way
 The number one gives so much value that they want to send up and number two
 There should be mechanisms built inside of each tier that actually physically moves them to the next tier
 Okay, and chat homes on his is free web class the beginning the end of it
 Push them into six week program
 Then the six week program at two bonus coaching calls those two coaching calls
 We're then there to send them to next year and so on and so forth
 And so that's kind of the process of what a value ladder is
 But again, this is the piece of one days to get the real secret is understanding that
 Creating tons of value and building the mechanism actually gets somebody to send to the next tier
