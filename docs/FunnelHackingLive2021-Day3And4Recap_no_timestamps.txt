 What's up everybody this Russell welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast all right
 I'm gonna break down day number three and day number four of funnel hacking live for you
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, so day three is where we start kind of transitioning into
 For me, it's like going very funnel specific
 Like I like taking people through on this day like the bottom of the value ladder moving up and just showing a lot of different ways
 To build funnels because there's so many different ways to do it right you can book funnels and challenge funnels and webinar funnels and high ticket funnels and
 Million other things in between summit funnels and yeah, there's a lot of stuff
 And so on day three I start kind of going into this and so the very first person that we had to speak in the morning was
 Canada Danielle and
 She's someone who has been on every news channel a million times Fox News
 CNBC like all the business stuff talking about investing and things like that and
 She thought that was gonna make her a bunch of money
 But it didn't and she ended up joining our two comic books coaching program a couple years ago and we got her focusing on
 driving off traffic to a funnel and
 In you know no time she became a two-comical winner and so it was kind of cool here. I'm here tell that story just showing
 You know how all these things that you she thought meant it was gonna be money, right?
 Like I thought you know TV on all these shows all the time. I thought these things were gonna be
 The things that made me money, but it wasn't it wasn't until actually had a funnel had a way to convert people into
 Customers that that I started making money and so it was really cool here in her presentation
 And then after that they started moving up to value ladder
 So next was Pedro Deo and Pedro has become infamous for challenge funnels
 Not like challenge funnels like the one funnel way which is a paid challenge funnel but doing free challenge funnels and so
 Pedro talked about that and he was awesome. He was on fire people weren't crazy
 This is actually important one the reason I had Pedro and here is because
 Inside the new to comic book coaching program if somebody chooses the expert route the first
 The first eight weeks we folks and then all doing a challenge and so it's kind of fun for them
 They'll see through pager like what you know these challenge phones look like and then later in the pitch
 We are just come back and kind of say oh, I think the pager did we're gonna be doing that
 And patrons give me one of the coaches helping on that which was really cool. So pager talked about free challenge funnels
 After he was done in paying June
 He's one of my favorite speakers, but he was stuck in Malaysia like we almost didn't know if he was gonna come in
 He's like anyway
 it was a big deal to get him here and luckily he made it to the States and
 It was cool as he showed how he basically take like a 30-minute presentation and
 30 30 minute presentation into an entire business
 And he showed how he did it with last time he spoke a fun walking live
 He took his presentation he made it a book and from there
 He had an upsell of the audiobook and the up sold the done for you version and then done with you version
 And he showed the whole process how you take one 30-minute presentation and turn into entire business
 And turn and you know kind of lead with the book funnel and that was really cool to see
 That's I think is something the most people could do pretty pretty simply and pretty easily
 After paying June they we start moving up the value ladder a little higher to Lauren Golden Lauren
 She's built her you know her empire and she went multiple to comic-class boards
 Primarily through webinar funnels. She talked about webinar funnels kind of showed her process there
 And then she talked about other bunch of the cool things that she was really excited to talk about as well
 But it was kind of the next phase of the value ladders like hey, here's a webinar funnel right after that after Lauren was done
 Then Sarah Petty had been doing
 Live event funnels and crushing it and doing you know huge volume and she the market she serves our photographers
 A lot of times people think well, there's not much money in photography
 You know like photographers don't are gonna hide pay for high ticket things
 but
 Sarah does these these virtual live events and gets photographers on them and then from their cells are really expensive high-end coaching and
 And they're killing it with it and it's just really cool to see because they do a lot of just things that I don't think through
 I don't know if it's like feminine masculine or maybe she's just more creative than me probably that one anyway, but you know all these cool things were
 When someone signs up for a virtual event and they get this box and the box has them unlocked
 You know open this thing first and this thing second this thing third kind of takes them through the this whole this whole journey
 but that's kind of what
 what
 Sarah talked about which was amazing and then after that then Eileen Wilder spoke about high ticket sales and
 and her presentation was really fun for me because
 She quoted a lot of like the old time
 Personal people who I'm studying right now, and so it was fun for me because I was like I've really those people right now
 And she's like quoting him and she's talking about him and her presentation was was awesome
 That was when I got my wife all fired up. Klette was like like I think got me on fire
 I got so excited about everything and so her just awesome and like the home morning was just it was just power packed and fun and exciting and
 Everybody ran over on time. So there was all the stress from the other things on our team
 But man, it turned out it turned out awesome that morning was was great
 So after that then we went and we broke to lunch now a couple things we did is we we broke to lunch
 And we had a special lunch for anybody who had wanted to comical board in the past
 That was for a couple reasons number one to give them a free lunch, but then also some you guys know that I've recently reopened my inner circle and
 One of the qualifications to be in the inner circle is to have one or two comical board
 So we had all the two comical board winners at lunch and then we
 Told them about the inner circle and invited them to to join if they wanted to and we ended up signing up
 A lot of people into the new inner circle, which is which is awesome. It was really soft pitch
 I just kind of said this is what it is if you're interested go set up
 And then go back and eat your have to have some lunch and so it wasn't like a hard pitch
 It was just kind of like you know letting them know there's an opportunity and that
 That's comes happening. So we had lunch after lunch we got back and I
 Was excited because over the last year so I become really good friends with the with a dude named Nick
 I'm gonna probably miss pronounced the last name. He's got the hardest last name ever so I don't know
 I apologize in advance Nick five I said but Nick San Tom
 Stastisio
 anyway, if you guys know Nick he was born with
 with one arm and
 You know legs I said two arms one arm is really small though and the one's got one finger on it stuff by that
 And I connected him a while ago and he was a wrestler too, which was really fun
 In fact to came to my house and I wrestled him we got video less wrestling
 But someone who's such a cool dude. I just love him and
 He gave a presentation called play the hand that you're dealt with and kind of showing people to like man like this is
 You know life is tough, you know, you've got a lot of hard things
 But he's like look at my you know look how the hand I was dealt yet because even with
 With this stuff he's become a bodybuilder to become a coach and he's become a speaker
 He's like done all these amazing things. He was a wrestler. He like
 You know I was able to you know just because he was born with something that was it would have made life harder
 He has a strong mind and he was able to do such amazing things. So it was awesome. I'm Nick there
 speaking and
 Then when Nick got done it was time for me to
 do my presentation to let people know about the our coaching program and
 Every year's is hard from because those you know anyone who studied my stuff
 They know how I sell and so anytime I start selling that I go here come
 But also let's try to sell something and so this presentation was a little different than a traditional perfect webinar
 The the elements were all there, but it was kind of wrapped differently
 But this was one where I was actually talking about personal development, which is something I haven't talked a lot about
 But I've been geeking out recently. I'm working on a book
 So I just kind of have a lot of stuff top of mind right now and so
 Yes, I did a presentation about that kind of stuff and then
 after the presentation was kind of towards the end then we talked to people about success inside of our coaching program and this year we have
 Every year we kind of redesigned two comic club ex we make it a little different
 We get feedback and make tweaks and changes and one of the biggest things that we're noticing right now is that like half our audience
 are people who want to be experts and half our audience are people who are selling physical products and
 Our coaching is always kind of steered towards more so towards people who are
 Who are like experts? That's kind of what I'm better at right and so this year
 We decided to partner with Allison Prince who is someone who has so much love and respect for and
 And we decided to break it out into two tracks
 So there's one track that's the e-com track one track that's the expert track and people get a pick which one they want
 And Allison also helped us, you know line up momentum coaches and how much other amazing things and just kind of really
 really tweak the program in a powerful powerful way and so when I did the presentation I would like to bring Allison out to kind of
 Talk about as well and people hadn't met Allison yet so
 It's kind of a weird thing to figure out how to how to do the presentation to to get you know people we've been to get to know her
 In a small short period of time then also from there
 Do our do our pitch of the new coaching program and so it's cool to Allison. She's she's made like 40 or 50 million dollars
 So I'm physical products like it's crazy
 But when I met her she was trying to learn how to become an expert and so it's kind of fun because I was able to tell her story about
 Or excuse me. She was actually I kind of told the story
 But she told it as well like you know I wanted to learn how to be an expert and so I came to Russell and you know
 He taught me these things and we did the webinar together and boom now
 I built this whole thing where you know
 Allison's one to comic book or to comic Club X and this year she went to hard award
 Which means they gave over a million dollars to charity and she was like I'll be able to do that because of the expert business
 The Russell taught me and then we're gonna kind of flip the tables and be like now Allison
 It's done physical product stuff in fact two weeks ago
 I decided I wanted to see how well her stuff worked to see how much we could do
 So we followed her process and put together an ecom product and we launched it and we ended up doing
 I think it was like 15 or 16 grand in two weeks off of just following Alice's process and like this stuff actually works
 This is so cool
 And so we kind of had both those application studies and write these are the two paths like who wants to be expert
 Who wants to be ecom?
 And it's like a 50/50 split my cake cool thing is that you can kind of pick whatever you want in the program
 And then from there we we sold the two comic books coaching program and and then after people signed up
 Todd and I got pictures of all the all the buyers so they have a you know a picture of me and them and Todd
 Up on stage they could look at as they're trying to work towards winning two comic club award and so that went really really well
 Sales crushed to Allison. It's so good and after dinner then we had Allison come back and do a whole hour long workshop
 teaching
 Her process and how it works and kind of showing showing all the things and so she did her presentation after dinner
 Which was really really cool and then kind of repitched soft pitch to TC CX again before went to bed that night
 That's happened in day number two and so it was amazing. We got to go through the entire value ladder different funnels
 We had chance here Nick just motivate the heck out of you excited about what's possible and then
 And then I got to do my personal element stuff and then Allison and I got a
 You know then see now it's got to come and talk about physical products
 so that was kind of the end of day number three and the day number four and I'm just gonna go directly in day four because
 Three and four kind of weave together day number four is where
 I came out in the morning. I did a presentation called bootstrapped
 which is you know how we built our business the loot boos trapped it and
 I actually announced a new a new award called the bootstrapped entrepreneur of the year award
 I talked about that and then I had my my twins were here at Funnel Hiking Live this year
 So brought that on stage helped me show the new awards which are insanely cool and then and then did a presentation showing how we bootstrapped
 ClickFunnels and kind of ups in the downs and told that story and then we did what's called a repeat
 Which is basically this is the last time times the coaching program
 Go and do it now and you know
 We took a break and people signed up and
 And that was kind of the end of the selling part of Funnel Hiking Live and then from there on out
 It's usually for me like I gotta relax and just enjoy the rest of the dinner, which is awesome
 And so the first the next presentation after the after the break was Garrett J. White and those you know Garrett
 Gare so every Funnel Hiking live in the past
 he's usually traditionally one I have to go and warn everybody that he's gonna curse a lot and you know if they need to they can leave and
 And every year I get people who complain because of Garrett, but I'll skip
 People who tell me it's like the thing that changed life the most and so I didn't know what to expect with Garrett as I know
 I don't don't normally know and this year he came out all in white with a choir and
 It was an interesting
 presentation he's recently
 found Christ which is amazing and
 And so he came and he did this presentation where they were you know
 We even business principals in with God and with Christ and they'd choir singing and it was powerful
 But same time I had people who are offended about that and anyway
 I don't know. I love Garrett. He gets people to move it
 It's like it doesn't matter which which side him dropping the F bomb from stage
 I'm talking about God from stage either way I get complaints
 But at the same time that you know people who don't complain all are just like that was the most amazing thing ever
 anyway, so it's always kind of a this weird thing so
 That's what not weird thing is and that's always an amazing thing
 It's always just like this tension for me of just like what's gonna happen. What's he gonna say? How's he gonna say it?
 Anyway, so that was Garrett
 And then from there we broke to lunch and we had a big welcome lunch for everyone who the two common club X member who signed up
 Which was really cool and then after lunch
 We had Tim Ballard flew out which was kind of cool
 And so we had him to come and say hi to everybody and talk about the Save a Child Challenge that we launched on day number one
 And which money we'd raise and Tim thanked everybody which was really cool
 I didn't see him in a while. It was really good seeing
 Seeing Tim and man him and his team are just
 They're amazing all the things that they're doing and there's a whole bunch of people talking negative about them online
 The things are not true people who got some is this true is this true like no
 This is not true people lying there horrible people who literally are
 Trying to get in the way of saving children like it's the most
 demonic evil thing in the world, but
 Tim and his people have such good hearts like they're there saving people from Afghanistan there
 Tim's running the Nazarene fun for Glenn Beck, which is like saving
 Thousands of kids and plus he's running the whole you are thing and it's just it's it's it's heavy and
 He could feel the weight on his his back and his shoulders carrying this mantle and so
 Anyway, I was grateful to be able to have him there and hopefully give him a little rest and show them that people love him
 And they are grateful for the work he's doing
 So that was cool. And then after that then Tony came and spoke and Tony
 Every year we never know how long he's been talked for I think last you know anyway this year our contract was three hours
 I think it's the first time Tony's been on stage in front of a whole huge group people as well
 and so he
 he went and
 He did his whole his presentation for three hours and they kept talking and then going for
 six hours on stage, which was
 Which was kind of crazy and and super awesome. So you know, we had Tony talked for six hours
 He's kept going and going and he just loved it
 I was like he asked him one time like he's like, don't you just stop like dude?
 Just keep going people here and they're happy they don't stop. So Tony went for six hours, which was awesome
 And then when he got done
 We got on stage Todd and I and kind of wrapped the event up and and that was it and that was funnel hacking live 2021
 and
 Every year it's like we're putting these together
 It's just like an insurmountable task like how do we sell the tickets?
 How do people show up and this year is even bigger because of COVID and the restrictions and the problems and that and just
 All the all the things that come with that, right?
 But man after going through the whole process. I see like how many people's lives were changed
 People that have their big aha is the big things they were hoping for people who who were stuck who got unstuck
 People who were able to go to the next step with us to the higher and coaching programs people who
 Are so excited about ClickFunnels 2.0 like just all the things and then getting all of our funnel hackers together and having people together to like
