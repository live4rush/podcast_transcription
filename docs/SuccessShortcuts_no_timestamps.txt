 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast. I hope you guys are excited because I got something really
 Fun to share with you guys today
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, so I just dropped my daughter off actually I was gonna drop her off and then I got so excited I sat there for last hour
 so
 For her very first one-on-one soccer practice and it's funny like
 She's playing soccer now for I think seven-rate seasons. She's getting really good. She's loving it
 She's like all the things right and she's getting good with her team growing and it's funny because
 I don't know it seems like some maybe it's just me
 But like sometimes we really get one part of our life and then we forget about that another part, right?
 So like for me in business obviously like I'm very coachable and I look for coaches and say okay
 I need a coach for this and a coach for this and coach for this and I try to get coaches for all their things
 Every time I have a gap in what I'm my skill set is I hire a coach and the coach helps me get through a thing
 and it's awesome and then I solve the problem and then we keep on moving forward, right and
 We had some similar
 Like when I was wrestling the same thing my dad would always find coaches like first my dad first
 I would go to practice my coach would coach me and I would go to a certain level but then my dad's like
 I'm not progressing fast enough
 Let me get another coach so my dad became the coach and you come after practice and wrestles me more
 I got even better and I started growing faster than everybody else
 Around me then my dad starts seeking out other coaches and you find
 Who are the high schools that their teams are winning and you might have drive me those high schools have those coaches coach me
 We find out who are the freestyle and the Greco clubs that the kids are winning
 We drive and find those coaches and have them coach me and I got coaching from so many amazing coaches growing up
 To make me an amazing wrestler and because I think about less than I've done the same thing in in business where I've been
 You know the intents of coaches and I've kind of forgot about that for my kids. I failed
 And so like I've had him in coaching
 But like I'm watching every season they get better and they get better and it wasn't until a couple weeks ago
 I was talking to one of my friends and he told me there's this local soccer coach who lives here
 He's like one of the best players in the world and I guess he moved here from Brazil and he does one-on-ones with
 With the soccer players and I was like oh my gosh
 I need like what was I thinking why haven't I done that yet?
 So called him up and hired him and they had the very first one-on-one practice today
 And I've watched for the last hour
 I watched her doing all these drills and these amazing things and I'm like oh my gosh
 If I just once a week or twice a week with her three times a week like she will she will get
 Like in the next 12 months
 She will basically done like four or five soccer seasons
 But even you know even probably more than that because because she's getting this personalized one-on-one attention with her their skill sets and her drills
 And all these kind of things like that. It's like in a year she could grow what takes most people four or five years to grow
 It was as I remember in wrestling. I would look back and
 Like let's say my sophomore year I wrestled these guys and then and then after the season ended
 I would go I would do freestyle
 I would do Greco so I'd get another like 80 matches during the season between freestyle and Greco
 I'd go rust like eight different coaches
 I'd go to college I'll rustle college kids and like all these things I come back to next season and the same guys who were you know
 Maybe as good as me maybe a little worse maybe a little better at the year prior
 I would come in and I would thrash them. They were like little babies. I was wrestling. They were so soft and tender and easy
 I'm like how in the world like what did you do this somewhere like nothing just wait until season started
 I'm like man between like the season and the next season. I got in probably four or five
 seasons worth of
 practice and matches and things like that and and so we come back it's like I'm five years ahead of you now and
 And so I'm thinking about my daughter and I'm watching her during the soccer practice
 I'm like I'm gonna say my son's like they're really good wrestlers and they're learning and I'm coaching them and they're going to high school
 But I just haven't been as consistent. It's hard to coach your own kids and I was like, you know what screw it
 I probably should have said in podcast. That's the worst you ever for Russell. You know what?
 I'm just gonna do it right and so I went and and during watching my daughter doing her
 Her soccer practice one-on-ones. I've messaged a guy who I know who's a really good wrestler here
 He seems to leave my Jones is actually funnel hacker - which is exciting. So he's one of our people
 But he's got wrestling camps. He does he's got a training program stuff like that
 And I was like I said I'm actually like leave I can I hire you to come like two times a week and just wrestle my kids and
 And help them between now and you know for forever and messes me back five things later done now
 We got him booked and he's coming to help my kids and I'm like, oh my gosh. Why do we do this to ourselves?
 So many times we get stuck in a problem and it could be anything like it could be your relationship your marriage or your
 Business whatever and we sit in the singing like oh, we're gonna we're gonna work on it. We're gonna incrementally get better
 You know my wife and I and she is the most amazing human on earth, you know for 17 years of our marriage
 We've been having a great marriage and we're always trying to get better
 But there's been hiccups and problems. We just kind of like wait through like well maybe we wait another week
 It'll just get better and that's been honestly a pattern for a long time at least it was for the first probably seven years of our marriage and then
 We had a chance to go to Tony Robbins event
 And I think I think I talked about that if you listen the podcast episode a little while ago with my wife and that like gave us a new
 Toolset and like we increased as a couple like so many things amazing to happen from that and we didn't do anything after that for
 I don't even know almost a decade, right?
 And it's just like in it's been funny. So last week we went to Stacey and Paul Martinez relationship development event and
 And it's for marriages but relationships and all your relationships and like in a three-day period of time I got more
 Skills and more things to help my relationship then I would have gotten in 10 years of being married
 So in in the three-day period of time we sure cut a 10 years of us
 Dinking around on our own trying to figure things out right like and and so like I progressed in a weekend more than I would have been in
 A year a couple years and probably you know
 We may never found these skill sets on our own in fact
 I'm sure we wouldn't have and so it sure cut it in so look at like man that three day and I look at just just my marriage alone
 Since we've been back for a couple weeks now like it is it is
 noticeably different because the different skill set different things different tools we have because of it, right and
 It's fascinating and I start thinking about that for myself like what are the other areas my life that I need to
 redouble down and coaching because
 You know Tony Robbins says this all the time like you can compress decades and today is it's like I need to I need to do that
 Like I need to do it more often and so
 I'm redoing that right now
 I know I've talked about this over the last five or six years more than once
 But I wanted to kind of I'm recommitting myself wanted to give you guys the ability to recommit as well
 So for my kids, I'm gonna try to find specific coaches for the things that they're excited about that
 They want to become better at so I can help them grow decades and days
 I'm gonna find for myself other areas of my life like it could be my relationships could be business could be
 Traffic generally could be writing could be whatever right?
 And so like focusing on those things and finding the right coaches to bring in to increase it
 You know, I know with just click for a loan like we've been you know
 I don't know business level are so many things and so many things you can work on so many things one of the things we've been very
 conscious of lately is like our customer support how to make it better and so recently Todd went and hired some insane amount
 You know some companies and team paid a ton of money come and help
 Increase and make our support better right like there's all these different different things and I just I value coaching so much
 And I kind of have forgotten about except as so much in the weeds with so many things in my life right now
 That I forget that sometimes I'm in the weeds because I don't have a coach to like point
 You know to point out like in wrestling. It's funny. I would go out on the mat
 And I don't know if you guys have ever been in the zone before that's probably the best way to to
 To the best thing to call it, but the zone for me is like when I come in and it's like I start wrestling
 In like I got all the nerves ahead time walking them out the whistle blows and shake hands and then like everything disappears
 I mean it's like weird thing when I don't hear anything and just doing the thing and like I
 Instinct like your subconscious mind you're stinks start picking up start picking up and you start doing whatever you've been training to do right?
 You get better and better and better
 And then I was in she's every time I get stuck like I get caught in something
 I get thrown in my back or something where I'm like I don't do all of a sudden like I would never hear any
 I'd never hear my coaches never hear the crowd never anything as soon as I get stuck
 I remember like awesome like I could hear my dad's voice or my coach's voice
 I never heard it but they could be yelling screaming bloody murder
 I wouldn't even hear it just like it stuck or get caught in something also my ears would like tune into them
 And I'd hear what they could say no matter where they're at in the in the gym and the wrestling room was crazy
 I can hear my dad or my coach with two voices
 I was tuned into say what I need to do and I'd make the adjustments
 And then the soon I'd back into like my flow state it would disappear again
 And I feel like I've been in that that flow state in business for so long where I've kind of tuned out all the coaches
 And now I'm like trying to consciously stop and I listen like let me tune into the voices that I trust
 To be a look from the outside perspective like you need to tweak here you change here
 You need it. This is the shift you need to make and so anyway, that's where I'm at. I'm a consciously do it
 For again for my kids for myself in business and relationships and different parts of my life
 And I want to encourage you guys to do as well
 find out where you're lacking find out where you're struggling and find a coach to help you and
 Doesn't have to be me it could be whoever you are that
 You know that that provides the relief that the help insights you need from the situation right now
 So hope it helps appreciate you guys for listening without said I'm going back in keep right and drop a secrets book
