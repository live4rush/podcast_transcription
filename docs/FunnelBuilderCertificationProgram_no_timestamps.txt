 Really introducing this new opportunity to people about becoming a funnel builder
 So the webinar went amazing
 We signed up a whole bunch of brand new people into the fun of other program. It was awesome

 There's some valuable you can get from it. So I hope you enjoy this episode with that said
 Welcome to the funnel builder training

 pockets

 Whatever like I'm not like bigger than Bitcoin bigger than real estate bigger than anything for you guys who are here today
 And so pretend like we're sitting here across the table and I'm telling you about something
 I know for a certainty is true. Okay, I've been in this funnel game for a long time and I know that right now more so than ever
 Becoming a funnel builders the thing is gonna change a lot of your guys life
 So that's what I'm gonna talk about we're having a one-one conversation
 Hang out each and every one of you guys and I want to have fun

 It's gonna be so much fun. So you guys ready for this if you are going to comments say Russell
 We are ready ready have some fun have ready for me to drop some fire
 I'm not careful. I'm gonna lose my voice before we're done. Okay, so the presentation again today is called funnel builders
 And I told you guys this is not like a web class or a webinar. I could typical thing
 This is a meeting and I want to talk to you about something and you guys saw the headline when you register for this webinar
 The headline was help help. I need funnel builders ASAP
 And this is not me just joking that this is something that is very very true
 We have so many people joining click funnels every single day
 I'm gonna share the stats the numbers here in a minute
 But they're coming in and it's interesting because most of them don't want to learn how to build a funnel
 They just want a funnel and that's where you guys come in. Okay now before I jump in
 I want to get some of the legal stuff out of the way excited people ask me
 Russell are you hiring for funnel building jobs like no, that's not this is not like me hiring you or giving you a job
 Any of that on this is helping understand like there's this huge demand and
 For people who want fun to build this and the supply of fun to build this who are good is very very very low
 And so I want you to understand a couple things. Here's my here's my disclosures disclosures before we jump into this number one
 This is not a job. I'm not offering you a job. Okay. I'm teaching you guys about a skill set that you can learn now
 With this skill set there's a lot of cool things you can do you can go and get a job
 In fact, we've got I think seven or eight full-time funnel builders on my team
 So this is the job that you if you master this most
 Companies need a funnel builder like this is the job that you can use but I'm talking to you about the skills that of funnel building
 Okay, you can use that skill set to get a job you can become a freelancer build fun which people you can start an agency
 You can work in an agency
 There's a whole bunch of opportunities that open up to you when you start understanding this
 Okay, and many people have already made this their full-time career in fact a bunch of them at the end of my presentation
 I've got I think about a dozen
 We're gonna jump on here and actually tell you their stories how they got into it what they do and all that kind of stuff
 And you guys are gonna love it
 From people from like some people are just doing on side
 You know what they're trying to get like some side hustle and they do one or two funnels a month for extra money
 Others who like and this is a full-time thing they do it 40 hours a week and others who build huge agencies
 We've got 20 or 30 funnel builders working for them and they're the ones pulling the strings and managing entire huge operations
 And so this can become your career if you master the skill set
 That's what I'm gonna talk to you guys about today is the skill set of funnel building and again
 I'm not here to make to my making or implying any income claims
 I'm gonna do my best not talk about money at all because that's not what this is about in fact if I would say
 Oh funnel builders charge X amount for a funnel like that's not even real because the very beginning when you first start doing this
 You're not gonna be any good and so you're not gonna be able to charge 25,000 hours for a funnel
 You might be like 50 bucks for a funnel because you're bad at it
 Right after you get better you can charge more and more and more
 So I'm not gonna put out any income claims or money things because that's not what this is about
 This is about helping you understand the skill set and then just like any profession the better you get the more you can charge
 With that skill set okay now before you start it
 I also want to know that the point of this presentation is not to sell you guys on funnels
 Okay, if you're like what's a funnel rust like we'll get a little bit into that
 But I'm not here selling on funnels. Okay. We've already kind of proven that funnels are the best way to drive traffic and sales online
 Like it's we've done so many tests so many I could drop like 400 slides or just proof
 We've been like before and after like this company versus company like we take a website turn to funnel like blew up the company
 So I'm not gonna talk about that my goal is not to sell you on funnels because we already know that a great thing since sliced bread
 It's already been proven over and over and over again. That's not my goal for today. Okay
 We already know and all of you guys who are here know that literally having a funnel when you're competing get somebody else in business is having
 It's like having it's like bringing a knife to gunfire
 Right like you're gonna win it's so much better
 It's just a better way to do it
 So I don't want to spend time on that
 I just want all you guys to assume be on the same side as me like funnels are the greatest things to slice bread
 Yes, greet that if you do go to comments and say
 Funnels are the greatest things to slice bread as I looked over somebody said slow down. I'm like, okay
 I'm trying to try to slow down okay, all right
 Okay, let's go. Yes, that all right. We'll keep going to this. So
 Like I said, I'm here today for you guys has helped okay, and our staff today
 We're pulling a stat to see how many people per day starts setting up a click phone on his account and on average
 We did like you're somebody's it's a thousand. This is five thousand
 But the average is about 1,823 people per day are signing up for a click funnels account
 1,823 people per day okay, so I did the math on that a second ago
 I said okay, if you time the time seven that's 12,761 people per week or signing up for click funnels
 If you'd over a month here's my little notes here over a month
 That's 54,690 people who are signing for click funnels if you over here at
 665,395 people who are signing up for a click funnels trial because they want to have a funnel okay, and that's what I'm here for
 Because so many people they just need help actually building funnels out okay
 Like I said these businesses are coming in here all they really want is they want a funnel
 It's kind of like if you guys have heard that analogy before when they say people go
 They buy a drill, but they don't actually want a drill all they really want is a hole in the wall
 Right and that's kind of what's happening here all these hundred thousand plus people are coming to click funnels and signing up
 Right they're coming for click funnels
 Which is the drill the thing that builds the funnel but all they really really want is they want a hole in the wall
 All they really want is a funnel okay, and that's where this huge opportunities come from okay
 These people are not here to learn how to build a funnel they're here because they just want a funnel
 You just understand that like that's the big opportunity here
 That's for finding is all these people are signing every single day and they kill I want a funnel
 I'm like hey, you are gonna teach you how to build like I don't have the time or the effort the energy to learn
 I don't want to learn I just want a funnel that's when I'm here and like do you guys build funnels?
 I'm like no, that's not the business win like we have software and training and they're like well
 We just want somebody to build a funnel who who could build a funnel for it? So I'm like I
 Don't know go Google it like you know and it's interesting like that's the biggest question we get by far hands down from the
 Thousand plus people day or signing up is I just want somebody to build me a funnel
 Who can do it for me and we don't know where to send it right now
 We're just like I don't know go go go search for somebody
 Okay, and that's why this opportunity is so big and so huge when I want to share with you today
 Okay, so the title my presentation is discover the perfect career
 And I call this the perfect career because this is something again
 You can work from home you can work on the road you get to know cool people like it's it's awesome
 So we're gonna have you help you discover the perfect career as a work-at-home funnel builder
 That lets you earn an income and build your own personal empire at the exact same time
 I'll talk about that here in a minute because there's some you guys like oh, this is cool Russell
 But I don't want to be a fun to build or somebody else
 I'm building my dream over here and you can actually do both at the same time
 You can learn while you earn or earn while you learn
 I mean and so we're talking about that and the other cool thing
 I'm gonna show you I'm gonna show you proof and data that this
 This profession this skill set actually works better and pays more during times of recession and times of inflation
 Which is really really good for all of us because right now as you know
 We're literally in the middle of a recession inflation is going nuts like it's never done before and so I'm always looking for
 What are the opportunities that during times when they get crazy are safe to give me and my family security?
 So I'm just stressing out what's gonna happen if this happens just happens right?
 And so this skill said something like said it works better and pays more during recessions and times of inflation
 Okay, so to start off with
 A lot of you guys know that at funnel hacking live this year Todd Dickerson and I got a stage
 And we announced something really really cool that we're working on and it's click funnels 2.0
 And also me guys like when do we get 2.0 and it's coming soon in fact
 We've got our first beta group has been going through it for the last three months
 We're open to the beta group for everyone who's out funnel hacking live that beta groups opening
 I believe June 6 or like a week away from that opening up where they're all gonna be coming in there all of our certified
 People can certified me in there in less than a week and so click on super notes here
 It's amazing like I'm having so much fun with you guys are gonna love it
 But I wanted to share this because this is what's causing most of the big like the demand is this this process
 And what's about to happen okay, and so I'm talking about that in fact I have a I made I made handouts for you
 You can't I show you this so this is the board I make so look at this thing right here who here knows what this is
 Hopefully I can see this right here who here knows what this is if you do in the comments post in the comments
 What it is alright, so me guys like I have no idea
 So me saying it's the cot the chasm okay
 This came from a book called crossing the chasm
 But this right here is the technology adoption life cycle and in a mini here
 I'm gonna ask you guys like where on this life cycle is click funnels
 Okay, but before we do I want to kind of tell you guys some stories
 So if you look at this this shows what happens to basically all tech
 Companies as they go through this process and go mainstream over here
 Okay, and so what happens the first company comes in and the first people come in over the innovators
 These people who see the new thing like oh, this is so cool
 And that's the first segment markets like 2.5 percent from there goes to the early adopters
 Which the next 13.5 percent and then there's this big chasm right and business that to change to be able to cross the chasm
 Or you get the majority of their business so a couple companies that I'm sure you're familiar with one of them was Apple
 Apple's a really good example this right Apple launch had these cool Mac the Mac computers and then this cult following right the cult
 Followings built right here between the innovators early adopters and they loved it
 They were kind of stuck right it wasn't though Steve Jobs came out announced the what the iPod boom
 That crossed the chasm and became Apple the first company to make like what to two trillion dollars in value
 Whatever it was right same the Apple Tesla Tesla first came out the roadsters right and they were expensive to came out there
 And they built this cult following who loved that car right?
 That's how it started here and wasn't until I think the model 3 came out that boom across the chasm and now
 Tesla is the biggest company Elon Musk is the richest man in the world right because of that and so that's what happens
 All technology comes they start with a product the product innovates eventually they get across the chasm and move into the majority
 So my question for you guys is where do you think click funnels is right now in this in this lifecycle?
 Here's what you guys think
 Some said Apple who
 Apple he mean click phones. Yes case
 So you think about this click photos launched initially eight years ago and when I I live this the first little bit for only people
 It came in initially the innovators were people that were internet marketing nerds like me who like this is so cool
 I was custom building on ship before I knew click photos and they all came in first
 And then we promoted marketed really really hard to get all the early adopters
 And you guys are all who have been part of this movement have been the early adopters like this is where we're at right now
 And right now click funnels 1.0, which has been amazing. It's got us to this point
 That's why we started doing 2.0 like a year and a half ago
 Almost two years ago now because we knew that we for us to be able to cross the chasm
 We had to make some changes now 2.0 is coming. It's very very soon like we're about to launch this new platform
 Which we're so excited for and when we do we're gonna be moving to this part
 Which means this opportunity which is already insane right 1800 people they signing up for it
 When it moves to the other side of the chasm this opportunity is gonna dramatically exponentially grow and so I'm trying to prepare
 You and me and everybody for this so that when we cross the chasm of 2.0
 We have people ready and in line who can actually help us build funnels for the influx of even more people coming in
 Does that make sense? So that's why this opportunity is so big. It's so important like this is why like I'm freaking out
 I stopped everything my entire team for last two weeks like we have to get this word out to get the process started
 So we have these people ready because the second 2.0 goes live
 It's gonna be too late and so that's why we're here to prepare you guys get you ready to be funnel builders for this new segment of people
 That are coming in okay, so again, this is where
 Where we have been in the in the early adopter phase and now we're about to move over to the early majority
 And it's so exciting and I'm so excited for you guys as well
 Okay, so I want to go to my story like when I first discovered funnels
 I'm sure all he has went through this experience, but I remember when I first discovered funnels
 I was in college. Just actually picture me and my
 College graduation May 14 2005 I graduated the whopping 2.38 GPA
 Please don't show my kids this because I want them to get good grades
 And I want them to be like man my dad was really dumb
 But I really struggled in school okay, but during this time while I was in school
 I was wrestling and then I figured out this thing called a funnel we didn't call funnels back then
 But you probably heard my story we made my first product turned to a funnel
 We launched it and I became obsessed and I started like I like I remember the very first time a potato gun funnel worked
 I was like this is the greatest thing in the world
 This will change any business and I started applying it to business after business after business after business and I had so much fun
 With it and I'm curious for you guys like do you remember when you first discovered funnels like the very first time you ever heard about it
 I'm sure the first time you heard it like I don't know what else I was talking about
 It's the funnel cake is this that like what is he even saying he talks too fast right you say funnel right like was it for you
 Was a webinar like this you we on webinar with me or somebody else and talking about funnels
 Like oh funnel that you have a light bulb moment
 Maybe you're listening my podcast and something happened you heard the podcast like oh funnel you had the light bulb moment
 Or maybe you read one of my books maybe you're a fun hockey
 I maybe you're somewhere right curious like for each year's when was it that you had the light bulb moment like funnels with the greatest thing in the world
 Like posting the comments like when it was you had that first thing when it was like boom the mind blow for you
 I want to hear when it was okay. Oh, man. I was thinking of these fast last year FHL YouTube
 YouTube video dot com secrets 10x event
 Okay, all you guys have everyone you guys have a funnel story. So you know this is the biggest thing right?
 You had that aha and you know that other people having every single eight hundred people a day or having a ha right now
 Come in me like this is amazing
 I need to be part of this and they come in there like but I don't know how to build it
 I just want one give me a funnel so I can just go and have it for my business right?
 So all the guys discover that now
 After you guys discovered it you started going in you started hearing me talk about this right?
 You heard Russell talk about you're just one funnel way you're one funnel way and you love marketing love funnels and so you started building funnels
 And I'm sure for most you guys you're somewhere in the cycle right?
 Maybe you've been building three or four funnels and so far it hasn't worked yet
 And right Russell I thought you said one funnel way which funnel is it and you keep trying a funnel after funnel after funnel
 Or some of you hasn't launched a funnel you had some success
 But it wasn't like the big thing you wanted yet right?
 But all of you guys are somewhere in there. We're trying to get your funnel now
 This is the big aha. This is the big take on and give to you
 Okay, I still believe that I will to the day I die
 I believe that you're just one funnel way, but it doesn't always mean that funnels for your business
 You guys getting this
 Okay, your big one funnel might be somebody else's funnel
 Right one of the hardest about businesses you have to go and you have to create a product and a service and customer support and fulfillment
 Like there's a million different things right?
 But what if you had someone else who already had all those things in place and you came in and you just built the funnel
 Right like I want you to understand like for a lot of you guys you're just one funnel way
 But it's not your funnel somebody else's funnel
 Okay, and there is a funnel building backdoor and that's what I'm talking about today
 This backdoor to get into the funnel building world to have success to actually make money to start making money while you're learning the principles of funnel
 Building before you go out there and like test it a hundred percent yourself
 And that is the key one you guys understand okay now
 How many of you guys know this guy right here Steven J. Larson you probably seen him his Facebook ads is YouTube ads
 I've seen everywhere. He's one of my favorite people inside of our community
 I love Steven and some of you guys see this you see the after picture of Steven right see him on stage
 He's got a two-com a cupboard in fact. I think he's launched like 50 something
 I was listening to podcast today's like my 54th product. I'm like holy moly, right?
 You see that you're like oh how many of you like Steven
 I don't know how to like create a product and a business and a customer support and like blah blah blah blah all these like
 It's overwhelming right but you see that but what most of you has to understand is this is the after picture
 So I want you to rewind back six or seven years ago
 I want to tell you about the before with Steven because the before of Steven is where most of you guys are today
 Okay, Steven came to this world right he learned about funnels here at my book calm secrets
 You started going through some of the things he was learning like this is so cool
 He had the aha just like all the other had the aha and then he's like
 I don't have a business yet like what am I gonna sell I don't even know what I'm gonna sell right
 He said okay. Well while I'm trying to learn this stuff
 I understand the principles of funnels
 What if I started building funnels for other people and they paid me to build these funnels
 And so while he was learning fun little funnel building and this is the random picture of him in a garage with his buddy
 Cutting open and I don't even know what this is but he was in here building funnels for other people
 In fact the very is our second funnel icon up the very first funnel icon
 I've Steven ever came to I met him first time I've met him right here
 I
 Didn't notice the time he told me later. He's like I did not have money to buy an
 Ticket to fun hacking live. I didn't have money to have a plane tickets
 I didn't money for hotel room so like so I traded funnels. I found a business to look
 I want to I want to go to this event called fun hacking live
 It's a thousand dollars a ticket is kind of expensive
 But I know I'm gonna learn some good stuff if you will pay for my ticket
 I'll build you a funnel and he had one business
 I sure and they gave me thousand bucks he built a funnel and boom he had to take a fun
 I can live and then he's like I don't have a way to get there
 So you found somebody else is like hey, um, I need plain tickets fun
 I can live if you pay for my pain to think it's I'll build you a funnel
 I'm gonna learn stuff
 I'll come back I'll build it and somebody paid for his plane ticket in exchange for phones and start trading funnels in exchange for
 Money for cash for things he needs to be successful. Okay, so he was making money while he was learning this principle
 Now Steven's actually here today at the end of the season come in and tell you guys his story because it's a fascinating story
 But that's the before okay. He was building funnels. He was making money while he was learning this now some amazing about this
 My favorite part of the story while he was doing this his skills are getting better and better and better
 He built the first funnel the second funnel the third funnel
 You can't believe funnels eventually actually hired and build funnels for me and keep getting better and better and better
 And then guess what happened one day he had the idea like I have a product
 I want to launch and he didn't at that point I have to go figure out how to build funnels
 He had the skillset
 He knew exactly how to do it and he said okay, let me take my product
 I'll plug it into funnel and boom
 That's how Steven went from like a brand new beginner entrepreneur to a two comic book winner like that
 It's because he already have the skill set
 So for you guys when you become a funnel builder you can build funnels for other people
 Right you're doing what you're getting paid to learn and practice to get better and better and better while you're developing your product on the side
 We're waiting till like wins a big opportunity to come for me
 Like when's it gonna be the thing that I'm gonna do okay?
 That's the power behind this you guys like like I think most of you guys want to be a big option
 You're gonna be on stage getting awards when I have your own business here on company cool
 You can do that but don't wait for that like start building funnels
 So other people now make money now while you're learning this process
 And then you've got the skill set to plug any product any business into when you're ready that makes sense
 Thank you. He's excited come
 Now a couple things I'll talk about I'll talk about
 The other side of this because right now the I call it they but they're the enemy right
 The the news they don't want you to believe this right the news wants to be scared
 And I didn't I didn't really believe this back in the I thought like oh no the news is always positive and they're telling us the truth
 And that's not true in fact the first time I actually understood this this one of my friends his name's Ryan Hall
 The hero's book called trust me I'm lying and it says as you can see here is called trust me
 I'm lying confessions of a medium manipulator and in this book
 He talks about how he would manipulate the media to do things that he needed to have happen
 To sell products to drive traffic to like get people elected like all sorts. It's crazy book
 Okay, but regardless after this book I was like I don't trust any news and I don't care if you're on the left or the right
 Like whatever it is they are not in like the business and making you happy and helping you know the truth
 They're in the business of causing fear and commotion to to push some agenda
 So understand that okay because they are the ones telling us like oh it's bad time
 They're the recession the economy like freak out like hold all your money story
 Like that's the messaging they're giving you right?
 But let me tell you the reality and this is like hard data
 We did a huge data research check out one things we found right now
 This is how many businesses are being built every single year okay 2019 with 3.5 million
 2020 4.3 and 2020 with 5.3 million companies
 2022 the estimate is 5.6 million businesses have been created
 Okay, you hear things like all the great recessions everyone's quitting their job like the economy's horrible
 It's like no these people are starting their own businesses at a rate that's never seen before
 Okay, I mean 5.38 million people started a business in 2021. I guess where all those people need
 funnels
 This year it's 5.6 million people can create a business and guess what they all need they need funnels
 This is the greatest opportunity greatest time like the worst the economy gets the worst the recession like like all the stuff
 That's happening the more businesses start getting created because people try to figure out other ways
 And so your job is come and say I can help your business side this skill set that can blow up businesses
 Right and every there's more and more and more businesses and you don't need 5.6 million clients
 You need one or maybe two to have a lot of success
 Okay, and so this is the real staff
 So don't believe what the media is telling it
 This is the reality and this is why the opportunity is so powerful and so great right now
 Okay
 Now what one thing all these people the 5.6 million people are starting businesses one thing they all understand
 They all believe that old marketing does not work. They know that they know they're like yellow pages and classified ads and newspapers and radio and TV
 Like it's not working case. They're trying something like I was hoping like well
 I don't know what's gonna like drive traffic, but I don't know so they say start trying things in fact
 This is a really cool case study to me as a first company called fiber fix
 They create this really cool product
 They put it like Home Depot and Lowe's and things like that and they put out there and start selling it
 They made some sales
 Organically and they thought we know how to blow this up online because we know this is a big opportunity
 And so what they did is they went they hired the Harmon brothers and the Harmon brothers are some of the best video like viral video creators
 On the on the planet. I don't know what they paid for this
 I know I've hired Harmon brothers a couple times they usually charge about half a million dollars to make a video like this
 They made this video for Harmon brothers made this video for them and they launched it the video and viral driving traffic to their Amazon store
 And guess what happened?
 Almost nothing it was like crickets like they were driving it to this brick wall and people weren't buying they're buying other products
 Like it just it didn't do very well
 Right and so they start freaking out like we spent half a million dollars on this ad campaign and know like people aren't buying
 What do we do is so guess what they did?
 They came to somebody know who happens to be a funnel builder and they said Russell. You're a funnel builder
 Nobody's buying with tons of traffic, but nobody's buying can you help us out?
 I said I would love to help you out
 So I took this concept and we ended up building out an actual funnel for them. Oh, don't behold a funnel
 Who knew it works to build the funnel for them build out the funnel?
 We kept the traffic from that video coming start driving this funnel and guess what boom this company exploded overnight
 Because we had a funnel for them, okay, and eventually they actually build up so big
 They actually sold the company cashed out made a ton of money
 But the funnel was the key case all these businesses know they need me driving traffic online to buying Facebook ads and YouTube ads
 And most were losing money every single day just like fiberface you come in and you build a funnel for them
 And all of a sudden you like a magician like what did you do?
 We have more sales more traffic everything blows up because of you and your skill set, okay?
 And that's the power behind this now. Here's one of my favorite stories
 This is a guy named Sam Brandon and Sam actually lived out in San Francisco during the gold rush era
 so back in the whatever was eight the 1800s and
 During that time there was a lot of gold fever right everyone's looking for gold they're trying to find
 They're trying to find gold and Sam Brandon had a really good idea. He said all these people are searching for gold
 He's like I want to be the person who provides the tools
 So he learned around ahead of time
 I bought all of the shovels and the picks and all the gold mining tools bought them all and brought him to his off to his
 To his store so his store is only seen only one that had it then he walked out and he got some gold dust in his hands
 He can walk around and he yell up top as long as there's gold in the American River
 There's gold in the American River right?
 Yelly sings out and all these people are freaking out running around and they would run to his store because he was the only one
 That picks the shovels they bought all the picks up all the shovels went out started mining for gold and Sam
 Brennan became San Francisco's first millionaire
 Okay, you guys catch that
 Right everyone's out mining for gold
 But he was the one that provided the tools the picks and the shovels and he was the one that became rich
 Okay, I'm going to show this because as we talked about right now
 There's 5.6 million people starting their own businesses. They're all going out there panning for gold
 Okay, you guys have this unique opportunity to be a shovel shovel seller
 Well, you're the one who can sell the shovels the picks the tools the things they need to be successful
 And the reality is most he has make more money by selling the shovels than you would by starting a separate business
 Like that's the power behind this you doesn't understand that it's like one of the biggest wealth transfers of all time
 Okay, everyone's out there mining for gold 5.6 million people out there mining for gold this year and you're the one
 They have the ability if you become a funnel builder
 You have the ability to be the ones giving them the shovels the picks the access to do that and become super wealthy during that process
 That makes sense
 Okay, you guys getting this you shouldn't understand the power if you are getting this let me know in the comments over there
 All right, you guys are getting it so exciting so exciting. Okay now I again
 I know right now some guys this is awesome. Also, but I've been watching the news
 I've been hearing things and I see my Facebook feed my Instagram my Twitter like it's this time to be scared
 We should be like, you know businesses are failing everywhere
 Yeah, they are but like that's why they need to help the most right there's all this fear happening and what you guys understand once again
 They like like they don't want you guys to be in a spot where you're going out there and doing these amazing things
 Okay, the news the media like they benefit from you being scared. Okay now about two weeks ago
 I had this really cool chance you see this picture here
 Tony Robbins flew all of his top affiliates and partners out to this is his studio in Florida
 We all flew out there and we had a chance it's like 15 of us to sit at Tony's feet
 He sat there for seven hours with Tony and it was cool because we got asked Tony any question we wanted
 So I asked Tony my question every person that chance asked the question Tony spent an hour with me
 Just drilling down on my question. It was crazy. Okay now
 I want you to imagine this Tony Robbins fights the biggest affiliates and partners out to the spice up
 He's got seven hours with us and to start this meeting off
 He's like before we get started. He's like right now the economy's crazy
 He's like I need you to watch this video. It's like a 25 minute videos like one who watches video
 This is the most valuable most important thing I can give you right this minute
 I was like okay
 So watch this video and it was like this video from Warren Buffett talking about the economy and what we needed to focus on and it was crazy
 And okay, you guys imagine like imagine being in this room right with 15 other top affiliates in rural Tony Robbins
 Imagine me like a fly on the wall senior listening and Tony saying look you guys
 We're about to go into the biggest recession. We've ever seen this is the nugget you need to know
 How many of you love to bend in that room and like here what Tony had to say?
 Yeah, you guys are all freaking out like I want to go. What did he say?
 Okay, well
 Unfortunately, I'm time for me to show you the whole 25 minute video
 But I took the 25 minute video and I carved down like less than a minute the biggest takeaway
 Do you guys want to hear like the biggest takeaway got it's simple, but it's so powerful. I don't want you guys to miss this
 So cool you guys want that sweet sweet kid. So check this out. So this is the video
 It was Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger talking about the economy the same things was happening and there's this one minute clip
 So I'm gonna show you guys this clip and I'm gonna talk about the big aha
 I want to make sure you don't miss from it. Okay, so here we go
 The best investment against inflation is to improve your own earning power
 Yeah, your own talents very few people maximize their talents and if you
 Increase your talents. They can't tax it while you're doing it. They you know, they can't take it away from you
 So if you become more useful in your activities your profession, you know, dr. Lawyer or whatever it may be
 That is the best protection against a currency that might
 Decline at a rapid rate and and the best investment
 Passive investment I think is is a good business if you own an interest in a good business. You're very likely to maintain
 Purchasing power no matter what happens at the currency, but it's interesting in the United States the value of the dollar
 Since I was born as a client by 94% to six cents
 So inflation is a very cruel tax on people who believe in fixed dollars
 But things can work out pretty well even during inflationary times
 I mean if somebody told me when I was born, you know that the dollar bill is gonna go to six cents
 I might have I might have said, you know, let me go let me go back
 I'm not I'm not interested in emerging into that kind of oral but actually it's worked out pretty well
 So I have no complaints
 Alright, do you guys catch that the two things?
 There's two things to protect yourself against all inflation and all the craziness is happening
 number one was Matt like
 Improving your own skill set right your skills doesn't matter if the dollar goes up or down or changes whatever like your skill sets
 Things that pay you no matter what so getting better and better like focusing on increasing your skill sets number one
 And number two is focusing on your own business those are the two things or are attaching yourself to a business that's successful
 Because those things even if the money volume like everything changes those are still gonna be there your skill sets still there
 And let's say the dollar disappears and instead we're gonna be trading and bartering
 Whatever like your skill set is the thing that gives you that that that power, okay?
 So that's the key
 That's why I wanted to like just emphasize this you guys understanding like right now
 It's the time for you to master your skill sets and to attach yourself to successful businesses if you do that
 That's you're gonna protect yourself and your family over next three to five years
 They're probably gonna get a little crazy, okay, so put it out there
 Just help you guys understand that now so the question then I want you to understand and like the point I want to make is that
 What is the most valuable skill to every business?
 Okay, the most valuable skill every business has is they need a funnel ball a funnel builder
 And what's a funnel builder a funnel builder is a rain maker somebody who can make it rain
 Okay, you guys seen the little pictures like making it rain
 Okay, but a funnel builder if funnel builder in any company is the person who comes in and is able to turn all the traffic
 Into cash for the business. It's the most vital most important role in the entire business is that of a funnel builder or a rain maker
 Okay, I'm sure there's one more quick video from Garrett white talking about the time
 You had the ah ha like oh my gosh like I need to be focused in marketing and building funnels because that's the key
 Okay, so I'm gonna show you guys this really quick video clip and we'll come back and start getting deep into exactly how to do this for you and
 For your potential clients
 Let me tell you story found a book in the business section and it was called 30 days to grill marketing by Glenn Livingston
 This is the first time I've read this book. I had actually never studied marketing in my life
 Now you heard the story that I had hundreds of employees. Yes
 And we were running successful businesses and we were doing tens of millions of dollars
 And I had never once considered that I was a
 marketer and it's 30 days of simple things that you can do day over day over day and
 For the first time the light bulb goes on
 Wait a second the way you control the game is
 You control
 the rain
 Being a marketer is the capacity to take a message and place that message into the marketplace
 Grab people's attention and pull them in a direction
 I had never once considered that my skill set should be focused on this idea of mastering
 Market because I've the story I told myself was that I am a businessman. I had never stood up and said I am a
 marketer I'm going to learn this and I will bleed to make this happen and
 It started with a change which was am I a businessman or I'm a marketer?
 I am a marketer. I wake up and the first thing I ask is how am I gonna make it rain?
 Every day in my businesses how am I gonna make it rain?
 Not a day goes by not Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday
 But I wake up and say how am I gonna make it rain because we can't make a rain your funnel is worth nothing
 All right, yes getting this the rain makers
 They're the people inside of a business that can drive traffic drive cells
 Okay, so if you want to win the game you have to learn how to make it rain, okay?
 So for fiber fix I came in they were struggling not having any success
 It could make sales online we came in provide the funnel and boom we made it rain for that company, okay?
 That's what a rain maker so rain makers any person brings clients money business or even intangible prestige an organization
 That's what you are as a funnel bull you are a rain maker, okay?
 Well, you understand that so I'll tell you the story
 This is Stephanie Blake some you has no Stephanie and actually Stephanie is gonna be coming on the end of the webinar to tell you some more
 Her stories her stories are fascinating
 But Stephanie is really fascinating because when she first got into this whole funnel game
 I did a webinar at this man probably six or seven years ago
 She heard about she decided she wanted to become a funnel builder and she started doing this and one of the very first fun
 She built she didn't she she and I'll tell you it's the rest of the way of the later
 She didn't charge for she built it because she wanted to prove that this funnel thing
 We actually worked for a business so she went out there and she built a test funnel for a chiropractor
 She gave it to him as a gift
 I hear's and is that actually said as a chiropractor she'd been to a couple years earlier
 She wanted to test this funnel thing out
 So she's like hey can I build a funnel for you and the guys like sure she built a funnel gave to the person helped launch it and it made
 And that funnel got her got this chiropractor 86 customers, right?
 Stephanie made it rain peppers 86 customers the east is customers and an average initial patient value between a thousand fifteen hundred bucks
 You knew the math and how much money that made the chiropractor
 But she literally came in there create something out of thin air the chiropractor didn't have gave it to him and boom
 86 customers started falling from air right rain. She's the rain maker right so Stephanie is a funnel builder
 I want you to understand that okay now
 Why is Stephanie a funnel builder because she knows how to make it rain?
 This is the skill set
 This is the thing that you are bringing to the marketplace
 This is why this such a valuable thing because if you can come in and say hey business who's struggling
 Let me give you 86 customers that fast like that changes everything for them
 Right and as a rain maker rain makers of the people inside of business like the most money because they're the ones who make it rain
 They're ones who bring the money the cash the customers into a business
 Okay, and now another option you can do it. No it doesn't know as someone is one of my favorite people
 I had a chance to interview him on stage
 At the time he was 14 years old when he did this interview and he was someone who like he didn't have his own
 Proctor service we found somebody else and he's like I'm gonna build funnels for this person and this is like a 15 second clip
 But it's like the my favorite part of this interview because I was I was just like first off fast and I'm like
 You're a fortune
 You know kid
 You're literally building funnels for other people and I asked him like how much money do you charge for a funnel?
 And I want you to hear what his response was because it's it's so powerful and so cool
 And it's the reason why if you match the skill set you can literally write your own paycheck for the rest of your life
 I know you've built funnels for yourself and for other people
 But when did you kind of say like I'm gonna build funnels you know for Caleb obviously other people like
 What was the reason why you kind of made that decision?
 I like building funnels for Caleb working with him and like not having to like worry about my own product like he worried about the product
 Filling it etc. All I needed to do was do the marketing
 Which is what I was really passionate about in about June of 2018
 I started my own agency how much do you charge somebody to build a funnel for them if someone wanted to work with me
 I honestly would like probably only work with them if I got a certain amount of equity in the business
 He's negotiating equity already. I love it
 Okay, yes, this this is the power of the skill set right no is a funnel builder
 Why because you know how to make it rain so much so the people are giving him is a fortune
 I'll get equating their company because he knows how to make it rain
 That's why you have to master and learn the skill set because it's the most profitable thing for any company any business
 You want to go into okay now the best way to become a rainmaker is become a funnel builder
 Does that make sense you guys hopefully I'm driving this point down
 I want to sell you guys my fact like this is what you need to be doing before I get into like the how-tos
 Okay, so who here wants become a funnel builder if you guys want to become a funnel builder type it in the chat want to hear who are my funnel builders
 Yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, okay
 If you want to be a funnel builder, okay, this is the thing if you want to be a funnel builder everyone wherever you're at tap yourself on the chest
 Right here and say I'm a funnel builder. I can't see you guys
 But I want you to do it literally tap yourself in chances that I'm a funnel builder right now
 I'm gonna do it again tap yourself a chest. I say I'm a funnel builder
 Okay, this has become part of your identity this is gonna part of identity you guys can do this
 This is not something that's that difficult
 It's got become part of your identity so tap yourself in the chest right now say I'm a funnel builder and type in the comments
 I am a funnel builder. All right. We've got looks like a thousand two thousand funnel builders here
 All right, okay. Well, that's the game plan you guys. I'm gonna jump into this then so again
 This is the most valuable skill so you can learn today period
 Okay, I can't think of anything more valuable more powerful that you can learn than this
 Okay, I tell my kids it's like school's good. This is valuable. This one is gonna change your life forever
 Okay, so my goal is this presentation number one is help shine a light on this new opportunity for you
 So you guys are aware of it you understand it number two
 I'm gonna show you exactly how to do it and literally by just watching this presentation
 I have a chance to go and you can just go do it on your own
 Okay
 And so it's gonna give you guys the tools and understanding you guys need to be able to do it
 And then number three is that at the end of this we're gonna be certifying a small group of people
 Who want to come certified funnel builders?
 I'm working directly with them to help them to get certified help and get clients and things like that
 Okay, and I call this the putting you on the bike
 Okay, and the reason why I say is how many guys have ever you know you've been in this game for a long time you listen the podcast
 You read the books you've got you bought the courses. You've got online
 We still don't have a funnel you haven't been able to do this yet
 Okay, my goal with this is not so much like have you you know read a book about how to ride a bike or have go to a course
 About ride a bike like I'm gonna get you the certified programs people who want to get on the bike
 And I mean my teammate actually I help run and they get you out the door
 So for those guys who like we want help I want to get this happening
 There is an option at the end of this to join a certification program, but it's not required
 You should be able to learn just enough from learning you could do this on your own or if you want you get certified
 And which I think it'll be really cool as well. So at the end of this I will be offering a certification program
 So here's the there's a front book to I'll be offering a certification program
 And I want to put out front that way we can get down and focus because everyone on this webinars like what's you gonna
 So me at the end what and now why you guys thinking about that the whole time?
 So yes, there's certification at the end it's eighteen thousand dollars, and that's it
 Okay, now that's out of the way can we get to work have some fun? Yes, cool with that actually how about this?
 I want to have fun on this webinar like the more you guys comment and chat and I see like a bunch of people spamming the chat like
 Spammers don't be like knowing like I want you guys playing the chat the full hour
 He gets responding back to me just like we're having a conversation
 So this is the deal the more fun we have today more fun
 I have actually if we have a lot of fun on this the more fun
 I have I'll actually drop that price for you if we don't have fun
 You guys are just boring sitting back there like tonight not paying attention the price is 18 grand
 But if you guys have fun to be out and we enjoy this and like I can learn teach you guys some cool stuff
 You learn some cool things. They have good time. I will drop that price. That's how I'm good
 That means if we have a lot of fun in the chat and comments
 You're gonna go from 18 to 17 to 16
 I'm like the price keep going down who knows how low to go
 But if you guys are boring then it's gonna go back to the 18,000 and we'll leave it there
 That's not good. Okay, you know one last recap before going this. This is not easy. This is not like oh Russell
 I'm gonna get quick get rich quick. I'm gonna get quick easy. This is not what this is about
 Okay, I'm not trying to give you guys some like magic pill
 This is what this is the work hard and learn it in demand a marketable skill and if you get really really good at skill
 Excuse me if you get really really good at that skill you probably have the opportunity to either get hired by someone
 Do it yourself do for other people but I want to understand that success is not guaranteed
 And it's not even easy that matter
 This is a skill so you have to learn and the better you get the more marketable of a skill you learn the more marketable
 You will be as a funnel builder and that's the key okay, so which one of you?
 I'm guessing if you're on this webinar you want to three people in fact
 We surveyed you guys as you were coming in how many guys who are on the show now you are a business owner
 Right and you're here and you're like I'm just here cuz I want to get a funnel builder like I don't want to learn this
 I just want to be I need to find a funnel builder and that's why you showed up if you're a funnel builder or even if you're a
 Business owner who needs a funnel builder?
 Bless on the comments down below number two is your funnel builder right and you're like I'm a funnel builder
 I want to make money building funnels for other people and number three is you're an agency owner like hey
 I have a traffic agency or I have a website building agency
 I want to add funnels as a service to my thing okay now
 Which one you guys want two or three comments down below if you're one two or three are we all that's ones two two two three three
 Okay, we got a mix of all of you as soon as they want to and three okay
 So you guys are everything cool. So if you're any of these three people then you are right
 This is the sprite spot for you as a behalf okay, okay, so you guys ready start building some funnels
 All right, let's go okay. So in today's short presentation three things I'm covered number one
 I'm gonna show you guys how to write your own swimming pool
 I'll tell you that is in a minute
 But it's the funnel builder cheat code that will help you to launch your new career fast number two
 You learn how to get paid twice you can actually get paid the funnel hack and then you get paid again to actually build the funnel
 And number three I'm gonna show you how it's happened to the unlimited stream of people who are literally begging you to build their funnels for them
 Okay, so secret number one how to write your own swimming pool now
 This is right again
 I call it the funnel builder cheat code that help you launch your new career fast
 So this is a quote from Paul McCartney was actually talking to John Lennon and they were
 Making some plans and stuff and they wanted to actually go and build a swimming pool
 And so part of a car and he told John Lennon said how about this?
 Let's go write ourselves a swimming pool and like when I heard that quote the person like that's so fascinating
 It wasn't like let's go earn some money and write a swimming pool and build a swimming pool
 It's like let's go write a song with our skill sets and it'll make us the money
 We can buy a swimming pool, okay?
 And the story behind this he actually did that then they wrote the wrote the song help
 They went viral whatever it wasn't viral platinum or whatever made a ton of money and then from that they built their swimming pool
 Okay, and so this is the quote from again from John or the Paul McCartney said John Lennon is going right yourself a swimming pool
 Now that's what this funnel building process is about if for you guys are thinking like okay
 What I want in life like I have student loans that you pay off right?
 Maybe I want to buy a car or something you can literally say okay
 Well, I'm gonna go build the funnel for somebody and that'll pay off my students
 I'm gonna go build a funnel for somebody and that'll buy my new car, right?
 And so I want you to think like what is your version that like what is your version of writing yourself a swimming pool?
 A couple years about a chance to meet this guy right here Robert Kiyosaki. He's the author of rich dad poor dad
 How do you guys read rich dad poor dad? This is the first entrepreneur book
 I've read and it lit me on fire
 I was like this is the most amazing thing in the world and one of the things you've said in here
 He said there's a difference between people who are rich and people who are poor
 He said people who are poor will look at something they want to see a house or a car
 They see a vacation they want to go on and they're like oh, I can't afford that and their mind instantly shuts down
 I can't afford that he said that the wealthy the rich they think about things differently
 They look at something like a house or a car or an airplane or whatever is they want and instead of saying I can't afford that they say
 How?
 Could I afford that?
 little difference right?
 It's almost the same words but little differences so if I can't afford that says how can I afford that and by asking question
 How can I afford that also the wheels you're gonna start spinning and all opportunities start coming out right?
 And so for you guys I want you to think about like for yourself
 Like why are you here like you came on this thing this this this training because you want something right?
 You're trying to maybe you have student loans that are having you want to get rid of them
 Or maybe you have a job you hate you want to get out of that or maybe for you like you want to buy a new car
 And you have like you've got something you want to take your family vacation right?
 So for you and say if you think oh I can't pay for that because it's expensive
 I want you to think like how can I afford that and the question for you guys if you have the skill set of vulnerabilities really easy
 Like oh, I'm gonna build a funnel for somebody Steven Larson want to come to fun like an I you couldn't afford a ticket
 So instead of saying I can't afford that he said how can I afford that?
 What if I went to my friend who needs a funnel and I had him buy my ticket and I build a funnel exchange boom shit to the question changes entire life
 Okay, so for you guys this skill set will help you to write your own swimming pool
 Right to help you to do whatever your thing is you're looking for so that's what I want to do with you
 With you guys help you understand that you can write your own swimming pool, okay?
 So for each of you guys real quick. I want to take a second like what's your swimming pool?
 What's the thing like I want to build a funnel because I want to be able to get this thing by the thing or pay off this thing
 Whatever what is your version of the swimming pool? Let me know in the comments down below. I see some of you guys
 Someone said retire their parents freedom. They want a house you pay off the mortgage path to death trip to Portugal
 I want to go with you a pain bills
 They want because I want to castle student loans a Tesla to my family by house ranch freedom
 They're going fast retirement vacation
 Holy moly, okay, you guys have you guys have some big swimming pools. So there's tons
 There's like I'm sure you guys do the comments. They're flying in your animal rescue very cool
 You can do stuff with with charities with you know
 The things you believe in the causes you believe in like when you understand the skill sets literally is easy like John Lennon said
 Right, let's go grab myself a swimming pool and go build myself a swimming pool and go build myself a funnel
 Okay, so step number one. Here's the process again. This process is not difficult three steps
 Okay, step number one is you have to pick the type of funnel you want to master
 You know there's lots of different types of funnels. You understand that like there's book funnels and like there's a bunch of facts
 If I go through here, here's someone there's squeeze fun squeeze page funnels. There's survey funnels. There's summit funnels
 There's challenge funnels. There's book funnels. There's cart funnels. There's paid challenge funnels
 There's vsl funnels webinar funnels. There's product launch funnels application funnels webinar funnels funnel hubs and funnel stacking
 Okay, we have a chance to see all of the data of all the funnel wheelers on this planet
 These are whatever 12 the 14 funnels that the majority of people are using okay
 So all you to use pick which one of these you want to master
 You don't have to master all of them by the way
 You don't have to be good at every single type of funnel
 You just got to be good at one like what's one type of funnel you want to master
 So that's step one was pick one type of funnel that you want to master
 Okay, step number two then you have to go and get a result with that funnel aka you got to go work for free
 Okay, and I told you guys Stephanie's story early, but I didn't tell you the rest of the story
 So Stephanie went and she built that funnel for the chiropractor gave her the chiropractor the chiropractor got 86 new clients
 Right. She made it rain form all these clients all his cash came to his practice
 And he was like this is the most amazing thing the world. How can I help you?
 And she's like well, I don't know do you have anybody else who would need a funnel as well
 He said yes
 I do and he called up all of the chiropractor buddies got him on a little webinar
 With Stephanie Stephanie came in and said, uh, let me show you the funnel that I built for your buddy
 And she showed the funnel and then checked this out from that one thing from that one funnel
 She built she gave away for free. She leveraged that that um that results
 She got for the one chiropractor and she did a webinar 10 of the chiropractors and nine of the 10 chiropractors signed up for her
 To become their her become a full-time funnel builder for them
 And seven of them still like this is like five or six years ago. Seven of them are still with her today
 You guys getting this one client. She finished if you got one funnel type
 She mastered it. She did it for free for somebody and she leveraged that and got nine other people to pay her to build the exact same funnel for them
 Okay, how many guys have life what was going off here?
 And I like oh my gosh if I just got good at one funnel type and I go find two or three people need that funnel
 I can make money. I think I already know how to do really really really well
 Like that's the key you guys I think and Stephanie's gonna be on here in like an hour for now
 We're gonna have her come on and tell her story
 But um that's what we guys understand like the steps are simple master one funnel type
 Um going do it for free for somebody and then leverage that result over and over again, okay?
 And uh, that's how
 Stephanie's become a rainmaker. Okay, so how much will people pay for a funnel?
 I get this question all the time and the reality is this number changes
 Okay, a lot of just depends on your skill set when you're first getting started
 Some might pay you like Stephanie zero they didn't pair anything so she built the funnel
 But then it worked she proved she can make it rain then what happened then everyone heard to build funnels for him, right?
 So you may not make any money from your first funnel. Okay, some people charge 50 bucks
 I've seen a thousand I've seen five thousand I've seen a hundred that like it's different all over the place
 It all depends on your skill set, right? You're the rainmaker you build a funnel that generates rain that gets people coming in
 You can charge a lot more or like no you can literally take equity like here's all build you a funnel
 But I want x percent of all the cells to come in okay because you're bringing the rain you have the ability to negotiate like crazy
 So it all depends on your skill set. Okay, most of you guys need it starting your first funnel is be really cheap
 Maybe no money at all because you get better and better you can uh, you can ask for more money
 Okay, so the first question for you guys is well, which type of funnel do you want to master again?
 There's a whole bunch of them, but let's say for example, you're like me and you're like I love book funnels
 Okay, you guys know I've written a bunch of books doc on secrets expert secrets traffic secrets
 So for me my favorite funnel. Okay, my favorite funnel is a book funnel
 I love them. I like doing them probably because I like writing well actually I don't like writing books if I like selling books
 Um, and so book funnels are my favorites. So I'm gonna show how this works for me
 So I have book funnels, right? And this is what one book funnel kind of looks like it's not that difficult
 There's one two three four five five pages in this one funnel
 Okay, now if you go through all my book funnels, you notice that all of them have the exact same five pages
 They don't change like this is what my book funnels all look like okay, and so
 Step one like I said, you gotta become good at a title of funnel types of me. It's book funnels
 Okay, now um next step is you gotta leverage that so um and about about the time I launched my second book
 Tony Robbins was launching his book money master the game and I remember that they were getting ready for the whole launch
 I remember going to this page and I was like, oh crap
 I was like interesting. That's the the funnel page you're gonna launch with Tony, huh?
 And I call him he's like, yeah, and I was like can I help you?
 Um, there's some things that we know about how to do book funnels that you are not doing at all
 And I was like can I help you? He's like sure okay
 So again, I looked at the first time in my head on thinking
 I'm interesting but in my head on thinking is like
 Like in my head. I'm like, we're screwed. This is like this funnel is so bad
 Like there's no way he's have success with it. So I came back to Tony
 I know how to do a book funnel. Let me just take this over
 I'll do it for free like just please let me do it
 So I came in I built Tony's book funnel
 You launched it and then that book went on and became a multiple New York Times bestseller
 Um and literally I just took that and worked for free and for me
 I use this because I want to get to know a lot of cool people
 So I want to get no Tony so I build a book funnel for him
 Okay, I want to get no Grant Cardone. So guess what I did?
 I was like Grant you got a book and I built a book funnel for you
 He said sure and he put me on his plane
 We literally built a book funnel while I was on his plane with him
 Which is so cool. Okay, so I built Grant's book funnel
 Uh, bulletproof uh David Ashford the Bulletproof Cookbook
 I flew out to the Bulletproof Cafe in LA
 We filmed the whole thing we built the book funnel for the Bulletproof book launch
 Which is so much fun, okay
 So for me like I love book funnel
 So I'm just gonna master that and I can literally use that to get into any door
 To get to know any author I want to get to know
 I'll build your book funnel
 Boom I become best friends with them
 Right, I can find other authors say
 I built 12 book funnels like this this and this
 Can I build a book funnel for you?
 I can literally charge whatever I want
 Okay, so if the question feels like what kind of funnel do you want to master
 I wish one gets you the most excited
 Okay, again, there's a lot of them
 Here's another one
 This is a product launch funnel
 And how do you guys have seen product launch funnel before?
 Jeff Walker kind of made these things famous for those who know
 So the product launch funnel is another kind
 Now this is one of my friends Kevin Richards
 And Kevin for whatever reason he loved the product launch funnel
 I was like this is amazing
 So we went out there to do his very first product launch
 And the first time is always hard, right?
 You got to learn how it works
 And like what's page one and page two
 And he studied it and figured it out
 And got it until it was perfect
 They launched this first book
 This first product launch funnel
 And he had success with it
 Okay, after he built one
 He had success with it
 Then he took that
 And he started leveraging it
 He would start going to all of the different internet marketing events
 That were happening
 He'd go there being the audience with 300-400 people
 And then like hey, my name's Kevin, what's your name?
 And they say and he's like
 Oh, I build launch funnel for people
 And people are like are you serious?
 Like do my launch funnel
 Do my launch funnel
 And he started getting clients like crazy
 He just went to every internet marketing event
 Told people he built launch funnels
 And everyone started giving him his business
 In fact, here's a few of them he did
 For like Jim Roan
 He's for Shanley Johnson
 For Brendan Bouchard
 For Success Magazine
 Like all those other people
 In fact I asked Kevin before
 I said how many launch funnels did you create?
 He said the first two years
 After he did the very first one
 The first two years
 He did 32 other launch funnels
 He's getting this
 Now the first one was hard
 He had to figure out all the strategy
 Understanding but after it was done
 The next one he's just
 Like I've already built it
 I just got to do the same thing
 But I'm going to change the branding
 And the logos and the videos and the messaging
 But like it wasn't
 The second one was easier and easier
 And every time you do it
 He could charge more money
 And more money and more money
 To eventually he was taking percentage of
 How much money was actually made inside the launches
 Okay, so Kevin is a great example
 Kevin is a funnel builder
 Why?
 Because he knows how to use product launch funnels
 To make it rain
 Okay, and that's the funnel type
 He wanted to geek out on
 And become the best in the world out
 Okay, so which kind of funnel
 Do you want to master?
 So I showed you guys
 BookFunnels, product launch funnels
 Here's another one
 There's one called the free challenge funnel
 Some of you guys have seen this
 I Pedro has made this like
 The most famous funnel in the world
 Like challenge funnels, right?
 But we don't know is that
 You can learn this challenge funnel model
 And you can build funnels for other people
 In fact Austin Ford is one of my friends
 And he geeked out
 He loves challenge funnels
 In fact they call him the king
 That's why he has this whole crown on
 And he got really good at building out challenge funnels
 Here's an example of what
 A challenge funnel looks like
 He worked on it perfectly
 Got better and better back to his awesome
 And after he did that
 He went out there
 And he started launching
 Challenge funnel after
 Challenge funnel after challenge funnel
 With person after person after person
 Right?
 And everyone was challenge funnel
 Just crushes it because
 He's mastered that one funnel type
 And clients pay him insane amounts of money
 To go and actually build out
 Entire challenge funnel with them
 Okay?
 And so Austin's actually going to be on
 At the very end of the season
 Come on and tell you guys the story as well
 So it's Kevin
 So all you can do is share
 They're going to come at the end
 And kind of tell you guys their stories
 So you can see exactly what they did
 And how they did it
 But I guys want to understand that
 Like this is the power
 Master one funnel type
 And go out there and leverage it
 And get tons more clients
 Okay?
 Now Austin is a funnel builder
 Why?
 Because he knows how to use
 Challenge funnels to make it rain
 Okay guys getting this
 Cool cool
 So which time funnel do you want to use?
 We showed a couple
 Here I'm going to show you one more
 One more is a funnel hub
 Now funnel hub is actually one that
 My friends Mike and AJ kind of invented
 And they invented this thing called a funnel hub
 And they built it out for me
 And a couple people got really good
 And they started leveraging the result
 Like hey Russell's got a funnel hub now
 And they started showing other people
 And they sold to me
 We got one for Dan Kennedy
 Steven Larson and Garrett White
 Like all these people started getting them as well
 And now they sell dozens and dozens
 And dozens of these funnel hubs
 Because they mastered the funnel type
 Got a result for somebody
 And then leveraged that over and over and over again
 Okay?
 And again Mike and AJ are funnel builders
 Why?
 Because they know how to use funnel hubs to make it rain
 Okay?
 So you just see how like
 Understanding this process
 You can literally go out there and write your own swimming pool
 You're like hey this is my goal
 I want to make X amount of money
 I want to this much I need for my car
 My vacation, pay off my students
 Whatever it is
 You forgot what the number is
 You want to master a funnel type
 Get really good at that
 And say okay
 For me to be able to buy this car
 I'm going to find five clients to build the same for
 And find one, two, three, four, five
 Or six clients or one client or two client
 Whatever it is
 But now you have the ability to go right here on paycheck
 Okay?
 One of the hardest things for most people
 In the world is they've got these fixed income
 Where it's like
 I make X amount of dollars a month
 That's all they have to go in like
 So they want to go do something different
 They got to work a night job
 They got to like
 You know not spend money
 Or they got to save money on things
 But like
 This gives you the ability to go out there
 And write your own swimming pool
 Right?
 Because something you can do on the side
 You can do it on weekends
 And as you get better and better and better at it
 You can quit your job
 And you have the things to just focus 100% on this thing
 Like Kevin for example
 After he mastered it
 And made the first sale
 Then 32 and 2 years
 You can full time job
 If you had 3 or 4 other people
 And they start building these funnels like crazy
 Because they do have much money
 They can make them each one
 And Kevin wrote himself 1000 swimming pools
 I don't know how many
 That's an exaggeration
 But you guys get what I'm saying
 Okay
 So there's three steps
 Again pick a funnel type that you want to master
 And there's a dozen of them right there
 Number two is get results to that funnel first
 And number three
 You leverage that result to get paid clients
 That's the magic
 Okay
 How many of you guys are getting this?
 If you're getting this tap yourself in the chest
 And say I'm a funnel builder
 I want to hear it
 Or type in the comments
 Because I can't see you right now
 It's like I'm a funnel builder
 Tap yourself to I'm a funnel builder
 Everyone in the comments right now
 I'm not going until everyone goes through this
 I want to make sure I got my funnel builders here
 If you're not a funnel builder
 You can leave at this point
 Right this sounds like way too much work Russell
 I don't want to build a funnel
 I don't even want a funnel
 As you guys can leave
 I don't care I don't want to funnel builder
 My funnel builders are here with me
 If you're a funnel builder tap yourself in the chest
 I don't care if you're at work right now
 And people are looking at you
 You got your headphones on
 You're trying to be low-key
 Like tap yourself
 Because I'm a funnel builder
 Maybe they'll fire you
 And then you got to focus on this
 So force you to like jump into this right
 Okay
 My funnel builders are here
 I wish we were in a big room together
 I can see guys going crazy
 But I can see down the chat
 So that's good enough for me
 So I'm a funnel builder
 Alright
 My funnel builders
 Let's keep on going
 Okay
 Now again
 I told you guys certification is not cheap
 But the more fun we have
 The lower prices again
 So far I'm having some fun
 So here's cool if I drop the price a little bit
 If you guys cool I can drop a little
 Or we can keep it
 For me I make more 18
 So I'm cool with that
 But if you guys want I can drop a little bit
 Okay
 Alright we're going to drop
 I'm some fun
 So
 There you go
 We've dropped down 17,000
 You guys will save a thousand bucks right now
 Because how much fun we're having
 You guys want to drop even more?
 Grab more one more time
 Tell me I'm a funnel builder
 If I see a funnel builder one more time
 I'll drop off a thousand bucks
 Everyone's telling me you're a funnel builder
 I'll drop off another thousand bucks
 Alright you're going to have fun too
 Alright okay
 Alright you guys got me
 We're dropping 17 now to 16
 So we're having fun
 Prices dropping
 This is a good time
 Okay
 You guys ready for me to go on next step
 Alright step number two
 So now what I'm talking about
 How you can actually get paid twice
 I know about you
 But a lot of times you do a job
 And you get paid once
 Which is cool
 But imagine you get paid twice
 Now it looks cool about this
 You get paid one time to funnel hack
 And then you get paid a second time to funnel build
 Let me explain how this works
 Because when you understand this
 It gets
 This game becomes really really fun
 Okay
 Now 99%
 Actually 99.999% of the people
 Who come into ClickFunnels
 They have no idea what kind of funnel they want to build
 Okay
 They literally come in and then the first question
 That's like cool
 Every can say I need a funnel
 I want a funnel
 Am I cool?
 What kind of funnel do you want?
 And they look at me blank stares
 Like
 I don't know
 Like you don't know what kind of funnel you want
 Like no they just told me I need a funnel
 So I'm here I want a funnel
 And I'm like
 You don't know
 And they have no idea what kind of funnel they want
 Right
 And so
 That is your job as a funnel build
 First off is to help them understand
 What funnel they need
 Because again there's a lot of different funnel types
 There's challenge funnels and book funnels
 Webinar funnels and leave funnels
 But every business is different
 Every situation is different
 So half of your job is just saying
 Look
 For your specific business
 This is the type of funnel you need to have
 And that alone is worth so much of somebody
 Okay
 So that's the first thing to understand
 There's two ways you get paid
 Number one
 Is you get paid to actually show them
 What you like
 What type of funnel they need to build
 This is you giving them the strategy
 From your head like
 Okay you are a dentist
 This is the kind of funnel you need
 This is the strategy for dentists
 Oh no you're a chiropractor
 This is the thing
 Oh you're an author
 This is the strategy
 Okay
 So step number one
 Is helping them understand the strategy
 And I'm about to show you this
 People will literally pay you
 Just explain to them the strategy
 Okay
 That's the first time you get paid
 Then the second time you get paid
 Is when they say
 That looks awesome
 I want to build it
 And they pay you again
 Then then then go and actually build the funnel
 So when you do the tactics
 Of the actual funnel build
 Okay
 That's the power you get paid twice
 You get paid once
 To explain them the strategy
 And you pay a second time
 To go into the tactics
 Kind of like building home right
 The first time the architect is paid
 To design the house
 And then the builders get paid
 To actually build the house
 Same thing with you
 But you can actually be both
 You can be the architect
 And the designer
 Okay that's what I'm talking about here
 So number one you get paid
 To show them the strategy
 Number two you get paid
 To actually build the funnel
 So let me show you how that works
 Okay
 So what is the strategy
 The strategy
 Is again people will help pay you
 To map out their potential sales
 Funnels
 Simulate traffic
 And see the profit potential
 Before you can build the funnel
 For them
 They want to see
 What it is
 That you're even going to do
 Okay
 Because most of them are coming
 Knowing that like
 I keep hearing I need a funnel
 But I don't know what that means
 So your job say
 Well here's the funnel
 This specific one you for your business
 Here's how it works
 And showing them all the numbers
 Okay that's what the strategies
 Is helping them understand them
 Okay
 Now Ben Moon is one of my really close friends
 I've been working really close
 To Ben recently
 And as we were kind of planning this
 He said
 Do you know how I do my strategies?
 I'm like no
 He said
 People pay me up front
 To go and do all the funnel hacking
 For them
 So it's like I go
 I do the funnel hacking
 I pretty build out the funnel
 I whiteboard
 I show them everything
 And then from that
 I show it to them
 And then afterwards
 If they like it
 Then they hire me then
 To go and build the actual funnel
 I said well how did you do it?
 He walked me through the process
 And it was really cool
 Okay
 And so what he
 And we're working together on this
 We've called it the Rainmaker proposal
 If you're coming and saying
 Look I'm a Rainmaker
 Let me show you
 This was my business
 This is what I would do
 To make it rain inside your business
 So this is the Rainmaker proposal
 And you get clients
 They're going to pay you for this
 How much they're going to pay you?
 It depends
 You can sell us for 50 bucks
 You sell for 500 bucks
 I don't really care
 Right
 And the better you get
 The more you can charge
 Okay
 Step one is the Rainmaker proposal
 You're going to pay you to go
 Make the proposal
 So first thing you're going to do
 Is you're going to reverse engineer
 Proven funnels
 AK you're going to funnel hack for them
 Okay
 Number two is then you're going to map out
 And simulate the funnel
 Inside of a software called Giroux
 We'll talk about it in a second
 And number three you're going to draft the proposal
 So let me show you how it works
 Number one is you got to find something
 That's working so they can model
 So if someone's a chiropractor
 And comes to me
 I want to go and show them like
 Here's other people with chiropractic funnels
 Because a lot of times
 Especially new people come in
 They don't understand what a funnel is
 They can't like bridge the gaps
 You're coming and saying
 Okay
 For your type business
 Let me show other people what they're doing
 That's working
 Okay, so separate ones you got to find something that's working
 So you can model
 So this is really cool software
 In fact let me come back
 I'm going to show you guys
 This software that
 All of our certified people get access to software
 I'll talk about it in a minute
 But this is really cool software
 You can go and actually
 Do the funnel hacking
 So this is the way it works
 So you come to the software
 And on the left hand side here
 There's Facebook ads
 Instagram ads
 Google ads
 YouTube ads
 So say YouTube ads
 You can sort by publishers
 So I come up here
 So I can advertise her
 Type in Russell Brunson
 And it's going to show you guys
 All of the YouTube ads
 I'm currently running
 Like oh there's all Russell's YouTube ads
 Right
 So you can see that or let's say
 I'm on your Facebook ads
 I'm looking for
 chiropractors in Boise Idaho
 I click on the button
 And boom
 Here's all the chiropractors and Boise
 Who are running paid ads
 So you can show that to them
 Then you click on it
 And actually shows you
 The funnel
 Okay, so here's the ad
 And here's the funnels going to
 And now I have a funnel
 I can show
 I can go in funnel hack
 I can show every single page in the process
 And now I show them
 Here's the ads that are working
 Here's the funnels that are working
 And that quick
 I look like a rock star
 Because I know more about the business than they even do
 Then I can take that data back
 And be like
 Okay, here's all the ads
 They're working in your industry
 These ones working in Boise
 These ones are in Chicago
 These ones from New York
 These are all the best people right now
 This is what their funnels actually look like
 And this is what we're going to be building for you
 And all of a sudden they're like
 Oh, that looks so cool
 They see it in action
 With another business like theirs
 Now they're more likely to trust you
 And believe you because
 You've actually proven
 Like you did all the research for them
 You funnel hacked for them
 Right
 So that's step number one
 Step number two then
 You're going to map out
 Their funnel
 A potential funnel
 And a software called Guru
 And you're going to actually simulate traffic
 Now I'm going to show you this tool real quick
 Before you go out there and be like
 I'm going to go buy Guru
 I'm in the process right now
 Buying this company
 Because I wanted to give Guru
 To every single one of my certified partners
 And so
 Just know that like
 This is the tool I'm going to be including for you guys
 We're like in the process
 Right now trying to close on
 On the company
 But I will soon own the software
 And then
 Again forever new certified
 You'll have to have access for free
 Is it okay if I ever deliver
 Yes, cool with that
 Okay, it's costing me
 Like
 Millions of dollars to buy this thing
 So I can just
 You can just go buy it if you want
 Or I can
 Okay, just
 All right, you guys are going to be over delivering
 Sweet
 Okay, so your knee is geared
 Let me show you how Guru works
 It's really cool
 Again, it's called
 Funnel Simulation Software
 You come in here
 And you can actually
 Kind of build something out
 And simulate it
 So this client sees what
 A funnel is going to look like
 So here's a little video showing the process
 So you log into Guru
 And you say, okay, here's your landing page
 Upsell your downsell page
 And you go and you actually
 Build out the funnel
 So they can visually see it
 Before anyone goes and actually
 Before you have to go building clickfunnels
 Right?
 Then you go in the add
 How much of these product in the cost
 You type in the data
 The product costs
 All that kind of stuff, right?
 After you put in the product
 Or the price versus
 Single product inside of the funnel
 You simulate it
 Then you come through and say, what do you think
 My conversion
 Like I think landing page
 With convert 20%
 Upsell page you convert this
 You put in the
 Your guest list
 What conversion rates will be
 And then after you do that
 And every single page
 Then you can go and add in
 YouTube ads or Facebook ads
 You show them it's ad costs
 And then you go and you click
 The simulate button
 And this will simulate
 What would happen if you build out this funnel
 And they spend $2,000 on Facebook ads
 Right?
 And the first time we simulate
 It's like, oh, they lost a thousand bucks
 Say, okay, but if we come back
 And we tweak this
 And get the conversion
 Up to 8%
 Let's see what it looks like now
 And then you click it and show them like
 Oh, this time based on these numbers
 You make 1500 bucks
 Okay, but you do this whole simulation
 You show the client
 And then they actually have a chance
 To understand it
 Then you can actually show that simulation
 With them
 And they can see it
 Is that amazing?
 So say if you have to go and build a whole
 Final for them
 And then show like all the work
 Head time
 You just build a simulation
 You show it to them
 Okay?
 And then they see them like
 Oh my gosh, it looks amazing
 And you can
 Helps with like client expectations as well
 Because you can say, look
 If this page converts it 5%
 We make money, but it's only 3%
 We're not going to make money
 So just you know, in the process
 When we keep
 We're going to tweaking and testing
 And getting things
 Until we get to this point
 As soon as it's 5%
 Now it's profitable
 Now it's like
 This is when it's going to be amazing
 Okay?
 So second step
 Is to build out the simulation
 And then sending that simulation to the client
 So they can see the whole process
 They can understand what's going to be happening
 And now they're ready to rock and roll
 Okay?
 Now again, like I said
 Those will get certified
 We're going to be giving you guys the software for free
 So just
 That's another gift for you guys
 You decide to go all in
 Okay?
 And the coolest thing is the agency version of Giru
 Is you can actually replace
 The Giru logo with your logo
 So no one even knows that Giru exists
 It looks like
 You're the genius
 And then the software
 You're like
 Oh, this is my
 Russell Brunson
 Funnel simulator software
 And let me plug it in my numbers
 So you send the reports
 And send the actual simulations to them
 And it all looks like it's coming from you
 Not from me
 Which is kind of cool
 That way they have no idea that
 We even exist
 It's just your own private label thing
 That's really, really cool
 Okay?
 So that'll be something
 That again will get all certified people
 Okay?
 And the step number three
 You send them the funnel build
 You send them the simulation
 And then you blow their minds
 Everything you gather
 And they're like
 Oh my gosh, this is amazing
 Now again, I want to understand
 They paid you for this market research
 They paid you, you went and all the research
 You're the funnel hacking, all the ads
 You see me in the funnel, you gave it to them
 Right?
 And after that's done
 Like this is amazing
 Guess what next question always is
 Can you build this for me?
 Yes, and that's how you get paid the second time
 Okay?
 Like I said, the first time you get paid
 To build out the framework
 This is the architect building
 Here's the architecture of the funnel
 And the second time
 Then you actually get paid
 To go and actually build the funnel
 Does that make sense?
 You guys getting this?
 Alright, cool
 Now it's funny, I was talking to Ben
 Because this is Ben's whole model
 He goes and he charges people
 His costs is thousand bucks
 Search thousand bucks to the whole funnel hack
 And then after he gives the whole thing to you
 Then they come back and they hide them to the funnel build
 And I asked him, actually last time
 It's like
 What percentage of people who you do the funnel hack for
 Actually paid for the funnel build
 And he said 80%
 I said, are you serious?
 80%
 He's like, now that's not actually true
 He's like, so far I've had 100%
 Everybody I did the funnel hack for
 Ended up hiring me to build a funnel
 Because that seems like kind of high
 It's like, okay, so
 I don't know what conversions will be
 But for Ben it's 100%
 You might be 5%
 You might be 0%
 I don't know
 But the conversion rate
 People who actually let you
 Architect the building
 The people actually have to build the building
 Is really really really really high
 Does that make sense?
 Sometimes it's scary for a client to say
 I'm going to give you $10,000 to build a funnel
 But I'll give you 100 bucks to build out my proposal
 And you get paid for that
 You do it and then like, this is amazing
 Yes, I trust you
 You know more about business than I do
 You do a lot of research
 You show them the funds they're going to look like
 Yes, of course, I'm going to give you money
 And that's how you close clients really easily
 Through that two-step process of the
 Proposal, the Rainmaker Proposal
 And then building the funnel for them afterwards
 Okay, so then the second time you paid
 Is the paid funnel build, okay
 And this is really simple
 Number one, you build the actual funnel you designed
 Then you test, you optimize it
 And you blow their minds once again
 And then you love blowing clients' minds
 Just makes them like, this person's amazing
 Okay, so what you do is you take your
 The funnel that you build out inside a gear
 That you simulate it and you go and you plug it
 And you build the whole thing into ClickFunnels
 That's, it's pretty simple
 Now again, this is not a
 I'm not going to do a whole ClickFunnels tutorial
 But for most you guys, it's pretty simple
 You go in there and you design the funnel steps
 Then you go into the actual page, drag and drop
 And build the funnel for them
 Number three, add all the upsells and downsells
 Members areas, wherever it is
 And then it's done, it's built in ClickFunnels
 And then you can go and you can give it to them
 Okay, now for those of you guys who can get certified
 I want to give you guys another gift
 You guys okay if I were to deliver once again
 So make sure you're cool with that
 Okay, you guys are cool with me?
 Okay, good
 Thank you
 Alright, I'm over to deliver once again
 For those of you guys who decide to get certified
 Inside a ClickFunnels 2.0
 We built what we call an agency account
 And this is only for people who are certified funnel builders
 Inside the agency account, what will happen
 Which is really cool
 Is you can create workspaces
 So that means let's say I get someone who's a chiropractor
 And I go and I can go in an encyclopedia
 Like on side here, these are called workspaces
 So these little workspaces here
 Each one is a separate ClickFunnels account
 So let's say I sign on a chiropractor
 I come in there, I can build a workspace
 It's just for him
 I know that I can build an entire funnel, get all set up
 I get everything done
 And the chiropractor is not paying for it
 I'm not paying for it
 But as soon as it's done, then I can give that funnel to
 I give that this account to the chiropractor
 They put their credit card in
 You get paid commission on that person's thing
 And then it goes live
 And you as one of the certified funnel builders
 You have the ability to add many of these workspaces you want
 So you can work on five or ten clients at once
 And you don't pay anything while you're building out those accounts
 And then when you get done, you hand it off to them
 And they start paying for it
 But this is just a huge...
 You guys are going to love this
 Everyone who I know who's got an agency
 Who's been playing ClickFunnels 3.0
 Is freaking out because this is like the greatest thing in the world
 And the only way to get the agency account
 You can't get any other way
 Unless you are one of our certified partners
 Just understanding that
 All right, you guys in the comments are freaking out about that
 Yes, those who know, no
 Okay, step number two
 After you get the funnel built out
 Then you got to go and you actually have to
 Get the copy on the pages, right?
 So what is copy?
 This is my partner Jim Edwards and I created a software called
 Funnel Scripts
 And I got something really cool with Funnel Scripts as well
 But basically what copy is on the page
 Copy is all the stuff on the funnel page
 So it's the headline, the videos
 The words, like all the words, right?
 It's the upsells, the downs, like
 This is all the copy
 Copy is also the ads, the words and the ads
 It's also the emails that get sent out, right?
 That's all copy
 Typically, like
 When I, these are actually sales, there's a hired somebody to write for me, right?
 This first one cost me $20,000, this is $20,000, $15,000
 This is like what really good copy there's a charge
 To write copy for sales pages and funnels and ads and things like that
 It's expensive
 Okay, and again, I can show you this, the wire transfer
 I literally paid that much for each of these individual sales letters
 Okay, and so one big secret, this is a write or down, write this down
 Number one way to increase what you charge somebody as a funnel builder
 Is to become awesome at copy
 Does that make sense?
 Okay, or find someone who's really good copy
 That you can have on part of your team
 Okay, because again, this is the price I'm paying for copy
 So you guys understand like it's the number weight increase that you're charging
 So if you're like, I'm making funnels, I want to make more money
 Get really good at copy
 Okay, now one thing you can do is
 Inside of Funnel Scripts, we create something special just for people who are certified
 And it's our agency account
 What that means is basically what you do is you go and you can create what's called an avatar profile
 You give that to your client and say, fill this out, tell us all about your dream customer
 And they fill out the entire thing for you
 They click a button and it saves that into your funnel scripts account
 And then inside your funnel scripts account you can make headlines and ads
 And you click a couple buttons and it does all the writing for you
 Okay, and so this is the tool we gave you to build, increase how much you charge for everyone to your clients
 Which is really cool as well, so the copy goes on the pages
 So it looks like this
 Right, click funnels, you build out the actual funnel
 Funnels Scripts, how you write all the copy that goes on all the pages as well
 Does that make sense?
 All right, cool, cool
 I'm so happy you guys are freaking out, I love the comments
 Like I'm trying to look over my, oh good, you guys are tracking, you guys are getting this
 Very cool, Ken, you guys are getting this, you're like, this is amazing
 Like, again, once time, I'm a funnel builder
 Yellow, I'm a funnel builder
 If you're a funnel builder, if you're a part of your like, I'm in, I'm drinking the cool in, I'm a funnel builder
 I may not be one yet, but I'm gonna become a funnel builder, I am a funnel builder
 Like this is my new identity, this is like, when I'm gonna do the rest of my life, like this is the greatest thing in the world
 If that is you, let me know, again, you can do this for your own business, for other people's businesses
 I leverage it to get to know people like Tony Robbins, like people want to get to know, like
 I build funnels for them for free, because I want to get to know cool people like
 This is like, the skill set that'll open up every door you've ever dreamt about
 It's literally like a backdoor to this economy that all you has been trying to get into forever
 Like, if you match the skill set, it is your pass into the cool kids club instantly, okay
 All right, so if you're a funnel builder, let me know
 All right, I told you guys would drop the price, are you just doing fun, fun, fun, I can drop the price some more
 But I want to make sure you guys are having fun, because when we start at 18, we've got down 16 so far
 But I can drop it a little more if you just want, let me know if you just want, okay, all right
 Yes, let's drop it again, okay
 Let's do this, if you get some warm time in your funnel builder, you like literally tap your chest over here
 Say, I'm a funnel builder, you'll have a top of your lungs wherever you're at, your kids, your wife, your spouse, your employees
 Your coworkers, then you're crazy, but yell out, I'm a funnel builder, let me know in the comments, that's you
 All right, okay guys, I'm a flat, that was good, okay
 We're 16, dropping 15, saving another thousand bucks, yeah, I'm fun
 Thank you for like, thanks for letting me have fun with this, you guys, I appreciate it
 Okay, you're gonna keep going?
 Okay, now I'm gonna talk about how to start getting all these clients
 So seek number three is how to tap into the literally unlimited stream of people
 Who are begging you to build funnels for them, okay?
 And there's tons of these, I'm gonna go through a couple more really quick, okay
 So in fact, I'm gonna go through six ways and I'm gonna kind of rapid fire these because I know
 There's so much more to talk about, I'm gonna go faster these, okay?
 So here's six quick ways to get clients that are just easy, okay?
 Number one, find somebody's got a, we call them a ugly funnel, an ugly funnel
 And then make them un-ugly, like I said, turn it off, it's funneling, they're about to launch it
 I was like, "Gah, that funnel is not optimized at all, like please let me fix this for you"
 He's like, "Oh yeah, and I just built it, right?"
 So make their funnel un-ugly, now guess what, how many ugly funnels do you think they're all in the world?
 I would say hundreds of millions potentially, maybe billions, right?
 There's a lot of them, so I use find a funnel that's ugly and then un-ugly it, okay?
 That's why I got to know, remember Noah, the 14-year-old kid I showed you earlier?
 That's why I got to know him, we built the page and I was like, "I can make it better,"
 he rebuilt one for me, didn't charge me anything to ask, he'll rebuild the for me and send to me,
 "Hey Russell, your funnel's kind of ugly, here's the new one, I hope you enjoy it"
 And sent to me as a gift and I was like, "Who is this 14-year-old kid?"
 I call him on the phone, got to know him and boom, like that's how he got his foot in the door
 He took an ugly foot wall, I'm not gonna admit that it was ugly, but he took my funnel and he made it better, okay?
 Like how powerful is this strategy now? Like there's tons of people out there
 who make a funnel better and you got your foot in the door, okay?
 Number two, again I love book funnels I told you this before, think about this, okay?
 You go to Amazon, how many authors are on Amazon? Millions, how many authors need a book funnel?
 All of them, so I went here today, I later typed in photography books just like,
 how many people have written a book on how to do photography, okay? Can you see it?
 Over 60,000 books on how to do photography, how many funnels do you think there are on people
 like, how many photography book funnels are there? I guess maybe a dozen probably less,
 that means there's 59,998 people who need book funnels and that's just photography,
 that's what happened gardening or I type in jujitsu or type in wrestling or type in boxing
 type in like whatever it is, like there are tens of thousands of authors who need book funnels
 and they're all sitting there not selling books on Amazon wondering why is nobody buying my book
 like literally you messaged them, I hate your books, awesome, but you need to sell these things
 to a funnel, I'll build the book funnel for you, I built it for so and so and so, I do it for you
 as well, boom, like unlimited leads, Jeff Bezos, thank you so much for giving us all the author's
 information right here for free on Amazon, okay? You guys getting this? There are so many ways,
 so many ways to get clients, okay? Number three, you can give away free funnels, like go and make
 a funnel, like make a book funnel or make a webinar funnel or make a product launch funnel,
 like make a funnel and then give it away and guess what? People who want product launch
 funnels guess what they want to do, they want to launch a product, people who want a free book
 funnel guess what they want, they want to launch a book, so if you make a product launch funnel and
 get away and people come in and give you email address for a free product launch funnel, you can
 contact a person and say, I saw you got my free product launch funnel, which is like me to actually
 custom build this thing for you and boom, you got to climb that fast, okay? This is one that we tested
 this with, we just give away a two page lead funnel and we got leads like, it was like the easiest
 thing it leads for, now I don't build funnels for other people, so I didn't follow up them, but I
 could have easily been like, hey, the 5,000 people gave me your email address, how many
 guys like me build a funnel, from 5,000 people, I bet I could get at least a couple dozen without
 even trying, okay? So build a free funnel, give it away and then upsell those people on you actually
 building the funnel out for them, okay? Live events, I told you about Kevin Richards earlier,
 Kevin got all of his clients by going to live events, okay? We have funnel like hacking live
 coming up in a couple of months, there's gonna be 7,000 people funnel like you live,
 of those 7,000 people, almost all of them need a funnel, so like going there and networking,
 you're gonna find people that need funnels, if you're a funnel builder, man, it's like
 dating, right? It's just matchmaking like heaven, okay? This is all of them, it's going to any live
 event, in fact, here's a, here's a bonus strategy for those who are paying attention,
 you guys want some bonus strategy? Like a week ago, Pedro launched his like challenge funnel
 live training, right? Now if you sign up for that, you saw there's probably a couple thousand
 people inside of that and all those couple thousand people, guess who they all want,
 they all want challenge funnels, like if you go in there and you're like the person being helpful,
 you can get tons of clients. Jeff Walker every year does a whole train teaching you how to
 do product launch funnels, okay? If you go to that community, you're like, hey, I can build
 product launch funnels for you, guess how many clients you can get, as many as you want, right?
 This is happening every single day, there's so many opportunities, right? And so it's just
 looking at opportunities, networking with people, becoming good at a funnel type, and then putting
 yourself out there and people will start coming to you, okay? Next secret, is start looking at
 people's value ladders, right? A lot of times you'll see a big marketer like, oh, they've got a web
 and our funnel, they're crushing it, but they only have one of like 10 funnels, okay? So you're like,
 hey, this person got a really good web and our funnel, what if I did a challenge funnel for them?
 Contact them, say, hey, you got a cool web and our funnel, let's do a challenge for your web
 and I'll build a whole thing out for you. And boom, you start building the funnel,
 start filling up the gaps in the value ladders, and you can take a percentage of that income,
 you can charge them per thing, like there's so many opportunities by looking at the gaps in
 somebody's existing businesses, okay? I would say of all the people I know in this industry, I know
 a lot, there's very, very few that have more than one or two types of funnels, right? And so you can
 come into all of those and be like, hey, you got a cool, a good high ticket funnel, but you need a
 survey funnel, you need a lead funnel, you need like, you guys see the power of this is like just
 building the funnels they don't have for them, okay? Fill in the gaps in the value ladder. All right,
 so for those of you guys who become certified, I got one other cool strategy, how many of you
 guys want this one as well? This is cool because I told you as number one question, we get it's like,
 who can build a funnel for me? And so we've been building in the background for the last probably,
 and almost seven or eight months now, a funnel builder marketplace. And this marketplace is just
 for people who are funnel builders and people who are looking for funnel builders to be like a
 matchmaker, we can connect people, okay? And so this is going live in probably 30 to 45 days now,
 so it's going to be going live. And initially, people were putting in here, people who are
 certified funnel builders, you will go inside of here and you literally go and post your projects
 and you'll be able to see like here's a person certified, here's all the certification badges,
 and by being a certified person inside of here, all the traffic comes, in fact, literally every
 email coming from ClickFunnels like, hey, need help? And it'll be in the footer, every email,
 it'll be email specifically about that saying if you need help building the funnel, go to the
 marketplace and find somebody to build a funnel for you, okay? Because again, the majority people
 come into my world, they do not want to learn how to build funnels, they just want a funnel.
 And so this marketplace is literally where we're going to be sending all of those people, okay?
 And so for you, if you're certified, a funnel builder, you can actually put your project listings
 here and you can start getting clients to that as well, okay? And so that's kind of a gift.
 So yeah, how many of you guys are excited so far? Who is freaking out with me?
 Awesome, okay. So today's presentation, a couple things. First off, talk about how you can write
 your own swimming pool, right? I showed you guys the funnel builder's cheat code, it's going to
 help you launch the new career fast. You guys remember that? I showed you exactly how to do it.
 Number two, I showed you how to get paid twice, one by building out the funnel proposal, and number
 two is actually building out the actual funnel. And number three, I showed you six ways to tap into
 like this unlimited stream of people who are begging you to have funnels built for them. There's
 way more ways on top of that. I just give you six really quick to get the wheels you had spinning,
 okay? Now how many of you guys are like, you saw and I got excited, but like, I'm also really
 really nervous. Russell talks really fast. I don't know all these things like he was using big words
 that I've never heard before. How many of you guys are nervous for whatever reason? If you're nervous,
 like, let me know, like, to say I'm nervous. Russell, I understand what you're saying. This sounds
 cool, but like, how do I get clients? I don't know how to build a funnel. I don't know how to do
 funnel simulation. Like, I don't even know what you're talking about. Like, okay, yeah, a lot of
 you, like most of you, like you're nervous. I totally understand. And I know that I've been
 talking fast. You're probably like, all the pieces may not be making sense, but you see the
 opportunity, right? So those of you guys are nervous. I got like a 12 second video to show you, to help
 you to get unnervous. You guys ready for this? Here we go.
 So first off, I understand no matter what you try in the beginning, it's going to suck
 because you suck, but you'll get better and you'll suck less as you keep doing this. And
 eventually you'll suck less so little that you'll actually be good. But just surrender to the fact
 that you're going to suck. He is getting this. And we understand, like at the beginning,
 you are going to suck. Your first funnel is going to be horrible. You're going to pay $0 for it, maybe
 $5 for a tail. But if you do it again and again, and again, eventually, as Garris and eventually,
 eventually, you'll suck less so little, but eventually you'll become good, right? And that is the reality.
 Okay? The key is that to give you is off the sideline, you started and have started building
 these funnels together. Okay? So I have a question for you guys. Do you guys have a minute for a
 question? Do you guys think that if you went through the process, talk about today, if you
 follow this funnel, the process, number one, you became really, really good at one funnel type,
 right? You learned how to become a rainmaker. You became a rainmaker with book funnels,
 with challenge funnels, with webinar funnels, you mastered one funnel type, right? And then you
 went and you got really good at crafting out the strategy and then actually building that funnel
 out, right? Understanding that again, at the very beginning, you were going to suck. It's not going
 to be very good. But you know that the end goal is to become a rainmaker where I can master this
 one funnel type, become so good, I get clients like crazy, right? You come back there. Do you
 think they follow this process? You get good at a funnel type, right? People pay you to actually go
 and build out a proposal. You give them a proposal. They see the proposal and they can hire you to
 actually build that funnel for them. Do you think you could do that? Okay? Yeah, it's not that
 difficult, right? It's not rocket science. Not like I have to learn how to run Facebook ads and
 Google and all these like crazy. It's like, no, I have to get really good at one funnel type and
 pick one and become really good at it. I got to figure out how to like build a simulation for it
 and just master understand that. And then I got to figure out to build that funnel out. Okay? And
 after you've mastered that once, you have all the keys like when Kevin did product launch fun,
 the first one was confusing, right? Rosia, the first time you do the funnel, it's going to be like,
 oh, this is so hard. And then like, you do it like, oh, that was actually pretty easy. And you can do
 it again and again and again, right? The reason why I'm able to launch the funnel so quickly is because
 I've done all the funnel types. Like we did this webinar, right? If you guys get on here,
 it wasn't hard. Like, all right, webinar, funnel stuff like three pages. We've got three pages,
 change the copy, change stuff and boom, we're live like 15 minutes. Like when you get good at it,
 it becomes easy. So just understanding you got to become master one. First time's going to be hard,
 you're going to suck and start selling a proposal and then from there, sell the actual funnel builds.
 Okay? So certification, I give you talk about it and it's not going to be cheap. We start 18,000,
 we got down to five, 15,000 today, which is pretty good price, you guys, for certification.
 I have friends doing certifications at $21,000 and higher. So 15,000 is actually a pretty good deal.
 But I'm a little lower. You guys want to go a little lower than that? If you do, again,
 away here, say it, my funnel builders, if you're a funnel builder, you're like, I'm in, I want
 to become I want to be certified. I want to be a funnel builder. If you're a funnel builder,
 tap yourself in the chest and say, I'm a funnel builder. Let me know. You guys are I'm a funnel
 builder. Yes. I'm a funnel. This is your new identity. You guys, the whole goal of this was
 give you as an identity. I understand you are a funnel builder. You can write your own swimming
 pools. Like you can have fun with this. You can get to know people. You can get connections and
 doors. Like we master this one skill set. It can change everything for you. So if you're funnel
 builder, tap yourself in the chest and say, I'm a funnel builder. I'm sure now all the people in
 your office around you're like, what are you talking about? Maybe you're in your car driving
 listening. The same thing holds the steering wheel to tap yourself. I'm a funnel builder.
 Okay. You guys are a funnel builder. All right. With that said, then as a funnel builder,
 as one of our certified people, I'm walking through everything you're going to get. Okay.
 The first thing you're going to get is the funnel building secrets online training courts. This is
 to help you to understand all of the funnels. Okay. So the guys are like, I don't understand
 what Russell's talking about. Like don't worry. We will slow and walk through funnel by funnel
 and help you understand how they all work. Okay. Now again, there's a bunch of funnels. Like
 we're going to walk you guys through how to build lead squeeze funnels, survey funnels,
 summit funnels, free challenge funnels, book funnels, cart funnels, paid challenge funnels,
 VSL funnels, webinar funnels, product launch funnels, application funnels, webinar funnels,
 funnel hubs and funnel stacking. Okay. Now again, you don't have to be good at all of those. That's
 to be key. Like, oh, Russell, that's a lot. You don't have to be good at all. You have to get it
 one. Okay. You're going to learn them all and figure out, man, I really like this one. For me,
 book funnels is my favorite. For you, maybe it's product launch funnels, maybe it's webinar,
 like you're going to pick one and become a master at it. So I don't think like, oh, this is overwhelming.
 No, these are all the ones you're going to pick, which one you like the most. And then you become
 a master at that one. Okay. Plus on top of that, um, right now people are paying a ton of money
 for membership sites and paying ton of money for follow up funnels, email campaigns. And so we're
 also in deep training on both of these. So you can add that to your skillset. You can say,
 I'm going to build your challenge funnel and a membership site. I'm going to build your challenge
 funnel plus your email sequence. Like we'll also do training on both of those as well. So you
 get some master both of those as well. Okay. So what you're going to get first off,
 you're going to get the funnel building secrets training course, which is a real life value of
 $4997. Okay. Second thing you're going to get is the funnel builder certification. Now this is
 the actual certification. We're going to certify you. So you can go out and tell me like, I've
 actually done this before. I'm not just, you know, some dude who's just making this up like,
 I've been certified, I understand the process, the strategy, psychology,
 occasion on the certification program. Now certification program, you can be certified
 in each funnel type. Now you don't have to do all of them once again, you can pick like, I want to,
 I want to become certified at survey funnels or summit funnels or product lunch funnels. Okay.
 If a chance to go through and get certified on each and every one of them, if you want to
 certify all of them, you can come a master funnel builder, which just means you're really,
 really cool. And you probably charge more to clients at the end of the day, but you can get
 certified in one or as many of these as you'd like to. Okay. We're also building a special
 certification for funnel hubs and a special certification for funnel stacking. These are
 two specialties that people will pay extra money for. We're also building a special certification
 just for follow up funnels. Okay. Again, these are things you can add to your resume. They'll
 increase the amount of money you can charge a client as well. And then we're thinking about,
 and this is just, this depends on if you guys get excited by this. We're thinking about adding
 in like a copywriting specialist certificate and a conversion one as well. Those may or may not
 come as well, but these are all things are happening inside the members area. Okay. So how does it
 actually work? What, what's really cool is it's very, it's very fun. Like the way it works is the
 very first when you go to members area, each week we're launching a new, a new certification. The
 very first thing is there's a video me teaching you guys the strategy. So here's the strategy about
 how to do a book funnel and you'll watch that you understand. Oh, that's how it works. Okay.
 Then you're going to get training from this guy in your great day because our team and Greg's
 going to show you how to technically use that and go into ClickFunnels actually build out that
 exact funnel. So you get the strategy first off, then you get the tactics, right? Then Jim Edwards
 is going to come to Jim's show you. Okay. Now you got the structure of the funnel built. We're
 going to go into funnel scripts. And here's the right, all the copy to get the headline, the VSL,
 the sales page, upsell it. And he's going to show you to go out how to use all the copy,
 what scripts to use, where to plug them into action, to, uh, where to get them from funnel
 scripts and where to plug them inside the actual funnel. And after you've gone through that training,
 then you have a chance to go with our, with our team on our side and they're actually going to
 help you to go build the funnel. So you're going to build the funnel from start to finish and get
 one completely done. And you're both the second one. And after you've had a chance to do it a couple
 of times and, uh, they make sure you understand all the things, how to do it, how to connect this
 shopping cart, the payments and the buttons and the design and the copy and you build the funnel out,
 then you'll get an actual official certification showing that you have proven the skill set you need to
 do to launch the book funnel. And then you do the same process for a webinar funnel. And each
 funnel type will go through the same process. I'll teach you the strategy, Greg's going to walk
 through the actual tactical how to build it out. Jim will go through the copy and how to get the
 copy on each page and then you'll have a chance to go to one of our, um, people on our team to go
 and help, uh, work with them to get a funnel built and approved. And then, uh, at a point,
 you'll get a certification for each of those things. Okay. And then from there, you go into the,
 the funnel builder marketplace, I'm certified on book funnels. Here's an example of a couple I've
 built and then boom, all of a sudden again, clients will start coming to you, you can go out there,
 start marketing your services, home and truly cool things as well. Okay. So that's how certification
 actually works. Okay. And again, our goal is help you become a rainmaker for each of the funnel
 types. Now again, you can just focus on one, you can do all of them. I don't really care. This is up
 to you. This is like your own self paced learning. So you can pick whatever which ones you want to
 focus on. Okay. Now this is something this, this, uh, group is starting next week. So this is a brand
 new thing. And so we're starting the first one to be like, we'll go through in a funnel hub to be
 first and then lead squeeze funnels and surveys and each week will be unlocking one of these over
 the next few weeks. Okay. Okay. Now how it works is that after you go through the certification
 program, you'll be certified for two years, right? So for two years, you're active certified. And after
 that, we have a $500 a year continuing education. And that's just to make sure that you're still up
 on the new things. You're learning the new updates and click phones and things like that. Plus keeps
 you in the members area, keeps you in the community, a bunch of other things like that. Okay. But the
 certification last for two years, which is cool. So you can get in there, start making, you know,
 tons of money building funnels for people. And then two years now, they have the continuing
 education credits. Now, this is one of my favorite things about certification program. We just built
 this out literally today. Inside the members area, there's a section that we call the huddles.
 Now, what a huddle is is basically you as a funnel builder, you don't want to be alone. Like,
 I have no idea, like, especially your very first time, your first two or three times,
 like when you're someone's paying you and you got to go and build a fund in simulation and you
 got to go funnel hack, you're going to be nervous, right? So what's cool is in the huddle, you come
 and say, look, here's my client. They're a chiropractor in Chicago. This is what I built out. What do
 you guys think? And then you get feedback inside of the huddle from everybody, right? And then you
 go on and after they hire you to build the funnel, you can build a funnel, come back and say,
 I built the funnel. Here's the page. What do you guys think? Which I tweet, which I change.
 And all of us collectively can help you to make sure that funnel is right. That way,
 when you get it to your client, it's going to look the best possible. So I just your
 guesses, but you get a whole community of other certified funnel builders who are helping you
 and coaching you through making sure it's successful. Okay. The reason why this is so important,
 this is my buddy Heath. Heath is one of the lead copywriters on our team. Here at ClickFunnels,
 he is amazing. And Heath is in a certification program for copywriters similar to this.
 And what's cool is that every time Heath writes a sales letter, like, for example, this is,
 he did the No BS letter one, you're also a sales letter, and it was really, really good.
 He sent to his mastermind group over there, and he had all the other people going there and
 ripping apart and like, Oh, the headline sucks. You're changing this ad this. What about this?
 And everyone gave us all his feedback. We came back, changed it. We launched this funnel and to
 this day, this is one of the highest company funnels we ever had. Okay. And it's all because
 these huddles that Heath does with this copy or any mastermind. So I want to build the same thing
 here inside the funnel builder certification program with a mastermind of people. We're all
 helping coach each other as we're doing proposals that we're doing funnel builds and things like
 that. And so that's what that huddle is for because I want no funnel builder to feel like they're
 alone. Now, we got a community of people here serving you helping together. Okay. So again,
 here's what we get inside the certification program. Number one, funnel builder secrets,
 all the training. Number two, the certification program plus the live huddle. So you'll never be
 alone. Total value, 19,994 dollars. Okay. Next thing you're going to get is the software packages.
 So number one, I told you right now, I'm in negotiations with show flat. Hopefully I have a
 close this week. We're buying gear route.com, which is the funnel simulation company. I love it.
 It's my favorite software tools in the world. You guys will get an agency account to that.
 Can agency account, let's you build out these funnel simulations, but then also change out
 the company logo. So your company logos on it. So you give it to client, they don't know we exist.
 Okay, which is really, really powerful. Now we can blow their minds. Now this is valuable bonus,
 because literally if you were to go to gear.com right now and look at it, it's 79 dollars a month
 for the pro. And then there's upsell for the for the agency version, which is like $150
 hundred bucks a month. Okay. So you're saving that. So say pain 79 bucks a month or 100 bucks a
 month or whatever it is, you get it for free for as long as you're an active funnel builder.
 Is that cool? Or is that super cool? Okay, that's like the math. That's like what? 800 bucks a month
 or 800 bucks a year or over 10 years, down or whatever the math is. It's you aren't ever paid
 for it again, because it'll all be in there for you guys. Okay. Next things you get clickfunnels,
 2.0 agency edition care beta for click funnels for all people that are finicking live goes live
 next week, I believe. And so you'll be part of that beta group as well, which is really, really
 cool. And what's going to happen is you'll get agency dish, which means, and again, this is only
 for certified people where you get these these workspaces where you can pre build out of
 a client's entire funnel without having to pay for anything extra. And what's done, you can give it
 to them and then they start paying for the click phones account. That gives you the ability to build
 and create cool things without the stress of like, I got to get this done because the monthly
 payment is going to hit for this client, you know, and you can do that. And then when it's done,
 you hand it off to them. Okay. So you get agency edition as well. Now on top of that,
 you're also going to get six months of click phones platinum for free. Okay. And what that means is,
 if you have a click phone account, now we're going to upgrade your click phones account 1.0
 and you get six more months on top of that. Also, the beta, like I said, for click phones 2.0 goes,
 you get six months access to click phones 2.0 for free. Right. And on top of that, you get the agency
 account, which the agency account is only for people who are certified. So again, what that means
 is when you become a certified partner for the next six months, you're paying any click phones
 fees. Now there is at six months, you have to pay your normal click funnels monthly dues, but for
 the next six months, there's no other click phones fees that gives you the ability to go in there
 and just have some fun and do things without the stress of any monthly payments. Okay. We're
 also going to be giving you the funnel scripts agency edition gym veterans work on this right
 now should be done next couple days where you have agency edition where you can literally create
 forms, send your clients, they fill out the form, click a button and it saves into your funnel
 scripts account and you can generate all the copy really, really quickly for them. And it's one of
 the coolest upgrades to, uh, to funnel scripts as well and agency editions only available to, uh,
 to people who are certified. And so we're going to get again, the funnel billers,
 secrets training, the funnel billers, secret certification plus the live huddles. You can get
 the gear agents account, the click phones agents account and the funnel scripts agency account
 who tote value $30,000, $985. You get excited. Someone said that's dope.
 That's dope. Drop the price. He's going to drop the price as well. Okay. Well, he has a
 careful delivered. And I'm still thinking about these pricing things. How about this?
 On top of that, like I said, um, there will be other people have a chance to list themselves
 inside the funnel builder marketplace, but the premium listings will be going to people who are
 certified. Premium listings means your badges are on there. You get highest ranking things like that.
 Um, because people are encompassing. I'm a higher funnel builder. We hire anyone, but if you want,
 I definitely recommend someone who's gone through the training who is certified. It was a badge on
 there. And like I said, we're going to be sending all of our people who asked the funnel
 directly in the marketplace. And so the better you get in here, the more success you get, the more
 people rating and reviewing the more stars, you get all kinds of stuff, the more clients you're
 going to get. Okay. And that's a big benefit as well. And then again, no funnel to build left behind.
 You guys get the certification program. We get the live trains that are happening every single week.
 Um, you obviously live help. Greg Dankins is the guy who's running the certification program.
 Just, you know, I asked, I asked Greg the other day. I said, how many
 funnels have you built in your lifetime, the site of ClickFunnels? And he does just, he has no,
 for our team, he's been in live funnel builds multiple times a day, for the last like six, seven
 years. He said the last time he counted was like over 5,000 funnels he's built from start to end,
 like everything connected live. And he said three, three people who he built funnels for who were
 clients who all hit two combo club boards. So he not only does this all day, recently, he's had
 success building funnels. They get into the two combo club. Okay. So understand that as well.
 This is the guy who's new live help going live each week, do much of stuff. He'll open off
 hours, bunch of stuff. He have access to Greg and his team of funnel builders. And on top that,
 we also have access to live huddles. Um, so just a lot of cool things. Because again, I just
 believe no funnel builder left behind. If you come in this program, this is your career, this is your
 identity. We are your tribe to help make sure you're successful, right? You're ups and you're down.
 The client goes bad. Things happen. Like all kinds of stuff we're here to help support you and
 helping be successful, right? And you have a client who launched something's not working.
 Like we're there to help like just fix things. In fact, we'll also give you access to our VIP support,
 VIP support, other things just to make sure that you are, um, you're taking care of inside of,
 uh, inside the program. Okay. So again, we're going to get funnel builder secrets training,
 funnel builder, secret certification, gear, new account, ClickFunnels account,
 funnel builder marketplace, told by $37,985. Now a couple of questions for you guys. Obviously,
 I'm not going to charge you as $37,985. Even though I think it's worth a lot more than that. Um,
 but if we were to charge you $37,985 and if all this did was helping you launch your brand new
 career as a funnel builder, would it be worth it? Yeah, most people go to college and pay a lot
 more than that to get a career and something that's not nearly as lucrative as this, right?
 Okay. So it's going to give you the skill sets to become a funnel builder, right? If all this
 was finally, give you the credentials you needed to be a funnel expert, would it be worth it?
 Yeah. A lot of you guys have tried to build funnels for the people, but you don't have the
 credentials. Now you can say, like, I'm certified. I've got the server guides program. I got my
 badge. I got my training. Here's funnels I've built in the past. It gives you like instant
 street cred, right? Your credibility makes it so much easier for you to go out and actually, um,
 sell funnels. And then last thing, if all this did was increase your skills and funnel strategy,
 building campaigns, copying conversion would be worth it. Yeah. Cause even if you never
 build a funnel for client ever, but you go through all this and you can better building funnels,
 they can do like Stephen Washington did and it's like plugging at whatever product you want and
 boom, watch to explode. Okay. So this skills that you guys are learning is the most valuable
 skills that you can learn. I've told you I over and over and over again. So right now,
 uh, we had two choices doing this. We can do what most of our competitors can do and they make
 really cheap crappy certification programs that literally mean nothing. In fact, I've seen some
 of them like, uh, we did it. We did a test. We joined someone's certification program. And from
 the time we bought it to the time we got certified, it was less than three minutes, like literally,
 and that's how, and like we've signed up to let it quiz, click the button and give us a badge.
 Like this is not even real. No one's going to trust this in the marketplace. Right? This is the
 certification program is tough. It's not going to be simple or easy. You have to go through stuff,
 you're going to build funnels, you have to prove it. We're going to have to go through it,
 audit your stuff to make sure you're actually good. Right? And so instead of doing the crappy
 option that gave you guys no actual value, we wanted to put up some barriers to make it exclusive,
 to make it expensive, to make it good so that this certification actually meant something you
 can actually get clients when all of a sudden done. Okay. So that's why we decided to go to the
 second option. So my question for you is how much of the thing that like just one client could be
 worth to you. Okay. Now, Stephanie, again, you're going to be Stephanie, you're like 15 minutes or
 something, but Stephanie built her first funnel for a client and she didn't get paid for it. She
 didn't for free. Give to him and she made it rain. Right? Now one client then referred her and she
 did webinar for 10 other clients. She had nine other people sign up. Nine other people sign up.
 They've been there, kept snowballing. And now she's got a whole funnel agency that she's built all
 because of one funnel. Right? What do you one client could be worth for you or two or three?
 Right? As soon as you get the skillset, you guys like it, the sky's the limit. You can write
 your own swimming pool whenever you want. Okay. You see why this is an amazing deal at the 18,000.
 We started out right? I easily again, my friends have certification programs and start $21,000
 of beyond. Okay. So 18,000 is a screaming a deal, but we had some fun today. I dropped it
 already down to $15,000. So we have some fun, but I'm still in good time. You guys have a good time
 as well. Okay. All right. Let's drop it some more. You guys want to drop a little more?
 How about this? Because you guys are the beta group because this is live train, the live train
 starts next week. You have a chance to go through this with us because you're part of the beta
 group in the long term. Like literally the plan is $18,000 will be the certification program moving
 forward. But because you guys are coming in and you're going through the process with us,
 you can help us iron out the kinks, you're going to be part of this foundational group.
 You're going to be in the live huddles learning and helping each other. Like we want to build
 like this amazing case station on this because you guys are in there. What if I knocked off
 another five grand without helping us? Oh, yeah. You're just like, drop it, drop it.
 Okay. Okay. Awesome. So what that means instead of charging us $15,000 certification,
 what we're going to do is you get started and become a certified funnel builder for this $9,997
 under 10 grand. Or if you need to, you can break up four payments at $29.97. That means you can
 get in here for a couple thousand bucks and start learning the skill sets, start building
 funnels for people. And you could potentially be making money to pay for your second payment
 or your third payment as you're going. Does that make sense? And so that's one of the
 ones you guys do is give you guys this amazing opportunity to get started and get in there
 and start building funnels for people. So again, it's one payment of $9,997, $9,997
 or four payments of $29,99 and they get started and you guys are ready. I'll get to
 use go to funnebilder.com/go. Okay. Now a couple other things. I'll wait for,
 now also forget on top of the certification, you're also getting the agency account to
 gurus. You're getting a six month account to click funnels, 1.0 and 2.0. You're also
 getting the agency edition, click funnels. You're also getting the agency edition of funnel scripts.
 Like you can't get these anywhere else unless you're a certified partner, which is cool.
 Okay. So which one of you, we talked about earlier, but how many of you guys are here and
 you're a business owner and you're just trying to find a funnel builder? Okay. If you are,
 I recommend if you're a business owner, you're here, like this is awesome. I want to learn how
 to build funnels. That's okay. Buy the certification, certify someone on your team,
 certify a kid or a spouse, certify one of your employees, find someone on your team who's
 underperforming, find them on website designers. They look website designer, you're good, but
 you're not making any money. I'm going to go take a certification program, make them a funnel builder,
 like get someone on your team and put them through the certification program. Then you've got a
 rock star sitting there who can be building funnels for you all day long every single day.
 Okay. So if you're a business owner, get someone on your team and certify them. Number one,
 number two, if you're like, this is my new career, this is my identity. I'm a funnel builder. I want
 to do this. Awesome. Jump in here, be part of this and start making money building funnels for other
 people. Number three, if you're an agency, you should come and be part of this like add funnel
 building as a service to your agency, right? And so come in here, get this, get the skills,
 get the training as an agency as well. Okay. So you right now have two choices. Your first option
 is don't do anything and not take this leap of faith, which is 100% risk free, by the way,
 or your second option is just test it out. Like literally, point at the tiny investments
 today compared to all value and return. Just give it a shot. Just see if this will work for you,
 right? If you're going to be ready to try to go through the process, check, I don't understand
 what's happening. Like let us know, we'll give you money back. I don't need your money. I want you
 to be completely understanding on that, right? I don't need your money. This is not about me at
 all. This is about you. So come in here, test it out and go through and do it. Okay. Because we
 have a philosophy here at ClickFunnels that if we can't make you money, then we don't deserve
 yours. So what that means is go through the program. You got 34 days, go through a signup,
 like go through the foundational training, go through all the different things, go learn
 the funnel types, go try to sell it. And if for some reason doesn't work for you, right? You
 literally have 34 days. So not today, if you don't like it for any reason, I don't care if it's 29
 days, 23 hours and 59 minutes from right now, just let me know and literally give you all your
 money back. I do not want it. I do not need it. This is a program for you to help you with your
 future skillset. Okay. That's my money back guarantee. You know, we are not some fly by
 that company. ClickFunnels have been on for eight years. We're not leaving. We're not going
 anywhere. So there's nothing to worry about. But you're so like you literally don't have to make
 the decision like am I going to do this or not? Like just decide like do I think this might work
 for me? If the answer is maybe then go and jump right in and go and do it. Come be part of this
 thing. Go through certification and figure it out. And if it's not for you, let us know and give
 you my back. I do not want it. I do not need it. Okay. But for most of you as if you go through this
 process, it will change your life forever. Okay. This people in those moments, it's like man,
 my life before I was a fun ability my life afterwards, right? Like everything changed for you. And
 you're gonna have a chance in a few minutes. I'm going to bring on a whole bunch of amazing
 fun ability to tell their stories and talk about how their life changed when they decided to make
 the same decision you're making right now. Like should I do this? Like, ah, it's a lot of money. Ah,
 scary. Like it's a whole new identity. It's a whole new different shift. Like should I do it? I don't
 know. Again, don't say yes or no to say maybe. I think this is for me. I'm going to jump in and
 try it. And then if it's not for you, let us know and we'll give you money back. But again,
 like all the people about to meet, it changes their life and it can change life as well. Okay.
 So the real question to you is this, is it worth gambling just a few minutes of your time to check
 this out, which even if only does half what I've claimed on today's training, we'll literally pay
 for itself as soon as you sell your very first funnel. That's the question. Okay. If you guys know
 the answer, now it's time to go to funnel builder.com/go. And again, I told you as we have over 100,000
 active entrepreneurs, we have 1,800 a day who are signing up and all these people are looking for
 funnels. They don't want to learn how to build funnels. They just want somebody to build funnels
 for them. Okay. Most of them need your help. And I need your help because I can't support all these
 people. I'd have to build a team like 400 people to build funnels for all of them. I'm not able
 or willing to do that. So I'm going to focus on software. US folks are becoming great funnel
 builders. Okay. Now someone was asking earlier like, well, I'm confused. I understand. I don't
 know what kind of funnel I even want to like that's the whole point of the certification. You shouldn't
 know what kind of funnel you're going to be master. You shouldn't know what's going to be the best.
 You shouldn't like that's why we're doing the certification. I want to open your eyes to the
 opportunity. Now you can come in and get certified and figure like, Oh, I actually like book funnels
 all right. I hate book funnels, but man, webinar, funnels light me up. I like product launch funnels.
 Like you can come here and go through and experience it and then decide what makes the most sense for
 you. Okay. So if you're confused about what funnel you should use, don't be. That's the whole point
 of the certification is to train you, hope you understand it, and then you can figure out what you
 want to specialize in. Does that make sense? Just like college, right? You go to college and first
 four years of college, you're just like, I'm just coming here and figuring out what's happening.
 And then you go and you specialize and you certify and the more, you know, the closer you get to the
 end, the more money you're able to make. Right. Same thing happens here. Okay. So here's where you
 can get inside the funnel bill certification program. Once again, the funnel bill is secrets
 trading. All the training, how to build funnels, you get the certification as long as as well as the
 the live huddles, you get the gear agency account, the ClickFunnels agency account, the funnel
 billers marketplace, 12 out of $37,985. And then I got one last special bonus for you guys. And this
 is only for those who set up right now. This is one of those bonuses we're going to pull away very
 soon. But I wanted to give this to you guys because I love people who take action. I know this is a
 scary thing for a lot of you guys. You're nervous. You're out of the fear of the anxiety, all the
 things right, your brain's saying, no, this is going to be hard to take. I want to push through
 that, right? I want to turn off the fear of the back, you had to turn off and let you move forward
 and face. I'm going to give you guys one more bonus that is so irresistible. I hope this this alone
 will be worth the money to join funnel builders. I showed you guys this funnel builder search engine.
 And this is powerful. I started using this a little while ago and I love it. That's me reverse
 engineer. I see the ads people running all sorts of stuff. And so what I'm going to do is that
 we're going to give you guys access to this. Now, a couple of things. There are two other software
 platforms that are similar to this, okay? Two of our competitors, one of them is called Adbeat.
 And Adbeat charges $390 a month. And they're just called similar web, similar web charges $449
 per month. Now, if you guys ever use these tools are awesome. Let you reverse engineer and
 see the ads people running all sorts of stuff. But they're insanely expensive. Even for me,
 I do pretty well. But whenever I got an adbeat account, I would like get everything ready. All
 my research, I go side up and I would try to like do as many as I could. Like I would, I had 30
 days. I'm like, I'm not paying for two months. That's so much money. I pay for 30 days. I try to
 get as much funnel hacking done as possible. And then I cancel my account and I wait like six,
 seven months. I go create another account for a, you know, a couple of days because it's so
 expensive. Right. And so we're able to tap into some amazing databases, pull some ads stuff for
 you. So we're going to give you guys a license and access to the front-ability search engine for free
 for as long as certification is active. That means you're not going to pay 400 bucks a month to
 add, be a charge you or 449, that similar web, you access to this entire database, everything
 for free for as long as certification. That's saying you 500 bucks a month times, you know,
 12 months, that's what five grand times 10 years, like $50,000 times a million. Like,
 anyway, it's a huge value. Save one, give you guys that way you guys can use this as well.
 This is a gift. We're going to give you those to get started right now by going to funnelbuilder.com
 slash go. You guys excited? I'm having so much fun right now. Okay. So again, you guys get certified
 today. You can certify for just one payment of $9,997, basically $10,000 or you can make up of four
 payments of $2,997. I'll get you to go to funnabuller.com slash go to start right now. Again,
 recap what you can get. You can get the funnabuller secrets, the funnabuller certification,
 the gear route, the clip funnels, the funnel scripts, agency accounts plus access to the
 marketplace. It goes live later on this month, told that I have $37,985 and you guys get all
 for just one payment of $909 today or four payments of $29,97 over the next four months.
 Okay. And again, you get started at funnabuller.com slash go. Now in a minute now, I got some guests
 I'm going to bring on. Before I do, I know I got a whole bunch of Q&A's. My team just
 slimmed me a piece of paper with a bunch of Q&A's. I think I have five or six questions I'm going
 to go through and then I'm actually going to bring on a bunch of funnelbuilders. I'll let you
 introduce it. I'm interested in them and have them tell their stories. You can see like what this
 career actually looks like on the other side. Okay. Sorry, I'm out of breath. I'm having so much
 fun over here. Okay. So the questions that are coming here's the question. Okay. So I think I have
 six, six questions here, seven questions. So the first question that my team said is their
 guarantee. So yes, there's a guarantee the guarantee is basically you come in here,
 go through the training, you got 30 days try it out at 30 days, right? This is worth the
 for me. Let us know and we'll cancel your money or cancel your if you're due monthly, we'll
 cancel, refund your money, if you paid full, we'll refund your money. So you have a 30 day guarantee
 to go through it and have some fun with it. Number two, we promote my service if I acquire a
 certification. So kind of, I'm not going to promote anybody as a specific funnel builder, but after
 you get certified, you have a chance to put yourself inside the funnel builder marketplace.
 And then for us, that's where we're driving. Everyone is looking for a funnel builder. We drive
 them to the marketplace. So the marketplace is there. It's a valuable tool, but you guys will be
 in charge of like obviously listing your services in the marketplace and making sure like doing
 deals, you get stars, get ratings or reviews and make good fun on putting your portfolio and we'll
 teach you how to do all kinds of stuff to make it so you're very, very attractive. People want to
 pay you, but your job is good. So we'll let you list you off the marketplace and I'll be sending
 tons of people there. But then it's your job to kind of get the leads and work through from there.
 On top of that, we'll be spending tons of time inside the certification program showing you how
 to get leads, how to get customers, how to sell them, how to close them. Like all kinds of stuff
 be covered as well in tons of detail because we want to make sure you guys are having success
 as well. So not only are you getting certified learning how to do all the stuff, we'll also be
 helping you guys with how to actually get clients, how to sell people, all that kind of stuff as well.
 That sound good? Okay. Question number three. Once I'm certified, is there a suggested price point
 to be to actually be charging for the product for my for the funnel builds? So the answer to that is
 kind of funnel building. There's there's a wide there's a wide range of prices, right? When most
 years against started, the first funnel might be free. You might just like Stephanie did like
 she built a funnel for free. Then she had success that she leveraged it and she charged
 more. Everyone charges different prices. Typically the type of business you're working with depends
 on how much money you can charge. Okay. So for example, let's say you are doing a funnel for a
 restaurant, right? Now restaurant, there's a lot of customers coming through, but the average person
 goes to restaurant might spend 50 bucks or 30 bucks, right? So if you get them one new client
 a month, they make an extra 50 bucks a month, you probably can't charge that much for that kind of
 a funnel, right? But let's say you you work with someone who is a dentist that's cosmetic surgery,
 and they're typical patient values, $10,000 for in this line, right? And if you get them one new
 client a month, they're making 10 grand a month, you can charge a lot more, right? Maybe give them
 three clients a month or five clients a month. Like, like, if you get, if you work with companies
 that have a higher customer value, you can charge a lot more. We'll teach those things in the
 certification program as well. But there's no like, like set pricing, right? This is all up to you
 and negotiation, but we'll walk you through how to do it. You know, the proposals we've seen
 people sell may were from $50 for funnel proposal up to Ben Moot charge the $1000 for funnel
 proposal, right? So there's that big range and the better you get them where you can charge, right?
 Supply and demand. You start getting a lot of clients are charging more and you get less
 clients coming in and you can work with ones you want, right? Same thing on the funnel building.
 Like the first, maybe you build a funnel for a hundred bucks, but if you get better, then you
 could charge more charge 500 charge a thousand. You get better and better thinking back and,
 you know, like Kevin charge a percentage of the product launch as opposed to charging for the
 funnel build, right? Or like Noah charge a percent, I get equity in the companies like there's so
 many things you can do, but it all comes down to how good you get in this game. Okay, so I'm going to
 give you all the tools and the resources and the training to make you amazing, but then it comes
 up to you like you got to take out you got to take these things to become really, really good. If you
 do that, man, you can have tons of success. Okay, so again, if you guys are on the fence, now is the
 time go to funnel builder.com/go. I have a couple of guests for a few years to admit. I got a couple
 more questions though, and then I'll introduce you some more funnel builders. Next question,
 three, four. How long do I have to complete the course? Okay, so this is cool things right now.
 Again, this is the beta group, which means right now you're going to get in there. There's a bunch
 of cool stuff you can dive into now this weekend. You can go through a bunch of foundational stuff
 for you because you're getting the wheels you're getting, and the next week we launched the first
 certification program, and each week we'll launch new and after that. And so what's cool about it,
 you can kind of do this in your own timeline. Some of you are going to be crazy and you're going to
 do it every time one releases, you're going to do it and have it done in like, you know, in a week
 and then be certified in that funnel type. Some of you guys may like, like maybe like I don't
 like book funnels. Survey funnels are stupid. I don't like these kind of like, oh, but I love
 this one. Maybe you just do one or you do two. It's totally up to you. I don't really care.
 You know, some of you guys like you can make an amazing income, a mashing just one funnel
 types. Maybe you're waiting for two or three weeks till that one comes and boom, you just go deep
 and understand that one and become amazing at that. Okay, but there's no like set time to complete
 them. Like you access to this again, when you sign up, you have two years accesses for two years,
 the training's there. And after that, it's just 500 bucks a year to continue education to keep
 your certification open. So yeah, number five, how many exams are there? Do I take them all?
 It'll be some, come certified. So there's for each funnel type, there's a train, there's a strategy
 training, technical training, copywriting training. And then you go and you actually are going to
 build two funnels using that funnel type. And then afterwards, there's a quiz you got to take.
 And that's it. Okay. Now again, there's a certification for each funnel type. So if
 that certification, like you'd be certified at book funnels and then you go to the marketplace,
 I'm certified at book funnels. Now I'm certified webinar for funnels. You can do each individual
 certification. You have a chance to go in and do those. So each certification does have an exam
 and a quiz. So you can have up to like 10 or 15, if you do all of them, you can have like one,
 if you just do one. Okay. Let's see. Will it be required to re-certify? So yes, the way it works
 again, you have two years access certification program in two years now, there's $500 a year
 recertification that'll give you basically the ability to go through, continue education,
 love new stuff to kind of update you. Some of those things will also be as we go deeper into
 like, potentially the copywriting training and the conversion training, things like that.
 Those will all be continuing education credits as well, that you'll continue to have after,
 as we keep going through it. Okay. Oh, this is I think it's the last question. Do I have a,
 is there a licensee fee or commission? So the answer is no, you are not paying me a licensing fee.
 There's no commission. You got to pay me. This is yours. Like you set, you sign up somebody,
 you keep all the money. It's your money. It's not mine. I make my money honestly by them using
 ClickFunnels accounts. So that's my evil motivations. If I get you really, really good at selling lots
 and lots of funnels, then those people need ClickFunnels accounts. And what's cool about
 those that we have an affiliate program. We have the, in fact, this is crazy. We did the math. We,
 we paid out $91 million in affiliate commission since ClickFunnels rely. So my goal is to pay
 you back commission. So you will get a client, you build a funnel for them, you give them the
 ClickFunnels account, they sign up for it and you get 40% of that money recurring. Is that crazy?
 So you get paid from the client, you get paid from us to you. I guess it's awesome. So my evil
 motivations, I want you guys going out there and getting more clients, more people using ClickFunnels.
 And so, yeah, there's nothing like, I don't, if you sell something for 10 grand or 100 grand or
 bajillion, I don't get none of that money. We just have them using ClickFunnels. That's,
 that's the, that's it. Does that make sense? Okay. So many good questions. Again, you guys,
 one last recap, this everything you get, you get the funnel bonus secrets training,
 the certification, the gear agency account, ClickFunnels agency account,
 Photoshop's agency account, agency account. My tongue is getting tired. We've been going for a
