 Hey everyone this Russell and I hope you guys are awesome. I just wanted to do a quick bonus episode here in the middle of everything
 Because we just finished the viral video launch party
 A couple days ago. It's Monday now and just kind of recovering from everything heading into their inner circle meeting
 And I've got a whole bunch of really cool things and a couple of podcasts
 I have scheduled to create a kind of story behind it what happened the pros the cons ups to downs
 feedback on the viral video
 Why we're excited and a bunch of other cool stuff, but
 Right now I'm heading actually to submit a circle meeting so I'm time to record those yet
 But I did want to share with you something. Hopefully I don't get in trouble for sharing
 But the morning that I was heading out to the viral video launch
 I got a text message from Frank Kern and those who don't know Frank he is a legend in our space
 I know I always looked up to and
 Some I've learned a ton from just and it was really cool because he had an event
 The same day and Ryan's zoom in all said event same day and we've all kind of been friends over the last couple years
 And it was just cool to send this message about
 About the ripple effect that what we do is causing and
 I thought it was really really neat and I just want to share with you guys, so
 I'm just gonna I'm just gonna plug the audio in as is and
 Just know that it was a private message to me and to Ryan so if anything is out of context
 That's kind of why but I think it was important because I want everyone of you guys to understand that
 what you do matters and
 You know we keep score and we talk about the money
 but the ripple effect that that you going out there as an entrepreneur and putting your products in your services and
 And being willing to risk your time and energy and your money and your talents and
 Everything with the goal to hopefully serve people and hopefully have an effect on people's lives is amazing
 so as an entrepreneur as a coach of entrepreneurs, I'm grateful for you guys for doing that and I hope that this message just gets you pumped about your message and
 And that's it so with no further ado
 I'll let you guys listen to the private we smell between Frank her and Ryan's zoom in and me
 Hey boys, what's happening?
 You know this is for Russell Brunson and Ryan's do men fella
 I think you guys know each other if you don't you should you would get along splendidly
 I'm making this for you because I'm on the way to teach my event and you guys have events too and we're all three
 Having events at the same day and I want you to think about
 Something that's really cool and I think will make you feel pretty good today
 So I want you to think about the people who are helped by your work and the first thing that comes to mind
 There's gonna be the people that are at the event right or your customers and that's cool. I mean good. Gosh
 You know talk about reach
 Brunson how much after first do you have you like seven billion or something?
 And that's awesome
 And you're doing a good job of helping them and Ryan you're doing a great job of helping your customers and they're increasing their
 Why was it and taking the pain out of selling and stuff and that's great?
 I'm helping people with direct response and that's really really cool
 And that's good and we could like really feel pretty good about that
 But I want you to consider the ripple effect and this is this really got me thinking this morning as I was getting dressed for
 for my event and the ripple effect is
 What happens when our customers go out and do good in the world?
 So last night one of my students and longtime clients a lady named Brooke Castillo comes over to my house
 And to see us to see me in Natalia and she brings a present
 And the present was a Chanel purse which looks a little weird on me, but it looked great on Natalia
 So I decided Natalia could have it
 The things like five grand by the way, right? And I'm like Brooks. Thank you. They're broke. Thank you so much
 You know, this is really cool. And she says yeah, I didn't bring you anything because you have everything and
 You know, I figured I didn't know how much happiness it brings you to give things to Natalia
 So I just figured I would cut straight to the chase and give something to Natalia
 And I'm like well, you're absolutely right. I know you guys are the same right?
 I mean we've kind of transcended the stuff level which is great
 And we all take the most pleasure in helping our families and stuff so that was really cool
 And I'm like we're gonna set a lot of money, you know, I've bought nine of these bags
 For Natalia already and they're you know, really expensive. She goes dude
 It doesn't matter because I am rich and she actually said that she says I don't care because I am so rich
 Which was awesome, right?
 So you know, we're reflecting on our business and she had gone from
 300,000 a year when she first met me which is nothing to sneeze at and
 Now she's at five million and we first started working together at 2014
 She joined the mastermind group of mine. I'm like, this is really cool and it is really cool, but what's cooler is
 What has happened to the world as a result of her being helped because she helps people and she helps a lot of people
 Overcome really really bad stuff such as over drinking which killed my dad
 So, you know, that definitely counts as a really really bad problem. It she's helped people
 Currently helps people overcome overeating which causes a wide range of health issues
 Of course bad self-esteem problems and things like that
 And she generally helps people just live a happier and more productive life and when I say people I'm into the tune of
 thousands of people
 Right, so I'm thinking about this concept of the ripple effect
 I'm like I helped her and that's really cool and like helped this like front line of people and that's really all I ever
 See, you know, and then it dawns on me last night and it dawned on me before but it kind of came back home
 That friend of mine last night that man some of those people go out and they helped a lot more people
 than
 I'm helping you know with with on my own so this speaks as kind of like a one plus one equals ten thousand
 Type of equation and then I started thinking about you two this morning because I was thinking how cool it was that
 We're all doing an event at the same time
 And I was like men all right, so I've helped those two guys and I know I'm not the only person who's helped you all
 So that's not the point of the conversation
 And then you guys have gone on to help God knows how many people right?
 I mean just Russell alone good lord. It's ridiculous, you know, and Ryan you know people like overcome the worst
 Part of business possible which is an incredible pain of selling one to one
 You know and you not really helped them alive with that and that's a big deal
 And I help them with the take the fear out of marketing and help them turn advertising and profit
 That's really a big deal and I saw well and good and then I'm thinking about you guys in your ripple effect
 Right, so it's like for example Russell
 I know you've helped you guys have all probably have these ripple effect stories that can come to mind
 But the one that came to mind for me this morning was Russell's you probably don't even really think about this as much or maybe you do
 But you've got that couple and I can't remember their names, but they wanted to work with you and they didn't have the money and
 You like gave them some advice and then a year later or something they come back and they're like yeah
 We're making a million bucks now. It's amazing and we're like, yeah, it's really cool
 You know it is really cool the holy crap
 Do you think of the life you know the quality of life that they have and their families and all this stuff?
 That's amazing and then I'm listening to the story is Russell telling it and
 These guys are in the health and fitness world right and they're spreading that message to people
 Every single week to God knows how many thousands of people and they're getting enough customers to make seven figures
 So clearly it's not an insignificant amount of customers and think of the effect that those guys are having one in the world in terms of
 eradicating the pain and suffering of disease and
 eradicating the pain and suffering those not being fit and that would have never happened if Russell hadn't given them that advice
 And so as I'm thinking about this, I'm like I'm gonna talk to these dudes through this voice memo thing
 Which is now seven hours long and point that out and kind of issue like a request
 To both of you guys today, and I'll make a commitment to you as well
 So here's the request of my commitment my request is that you deliberately hold this concept of the ripple effect in the front
 of your mind as you're doing this event like
 Just let it like plant the seed of this and your subconscious to be like, you know
 I want to let this event cause the greatest likelihood of ripple effect occurrence is humanly possible
 And then let's see what happens, you know, and then I will commit to do the same thing as well
 So like you know, obviously we're gonna pay for doing events or whatever, but do you see what I both know?
 We can get paid the same amount of money using the skills that we've been blessed with through hard work by the way
 We paid the same amount of money in the skills. We've got to sell plumbing, you know or tires
 Or cars or roofing or anything. It doesn't matter
 I mean the fundamentals of what we know are applicable to every single
 monetization method in the entire world, but we've chosen to
 Apply these skills to helping people advance towards what they really really want
 And it's really cool then I guess my point of saying all that is man
 The money's gonna happen anyway. It already had to sit away
 Right like we could screw up and still make a lot of money. That's really great. I'm gonna say that to be arrogant
 so why not
 Make it a really significant primary focus to deliberately
 engineer the likelihood of
 The ripple effect because you never know right we could help someone who becomes the next Tony Robbins or the next Rick Warren or the next Joel
 Osteen and really
 Fertilize the seed of massive change. So that's all I wanted to share with you, too
 I hope you guys have a great event. I'm going to for sure
 Well, I hope you break the world's record for bubble soccer as well
 And what what's really funny about that is if there is an existing world record for bubble soccer
 It has to point out that we live in the greatest and most prosperous time in history
 Because enough people have time to play bubble soccer
 Anyway boys that said man you guys have a have a good luck over the next couple of days
 I know you'll do great and here's to the ripple effect
