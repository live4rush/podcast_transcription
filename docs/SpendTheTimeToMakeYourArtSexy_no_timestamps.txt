 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast today
 I want to talk about a piece of marketing that I hope you guys see me doing
 If you follow me Instagram or Facebook even seeing me do if I want to address it and really talk about it
 I think those who are paying attention those who are listening with the ears to hear have kind of picked up on it
 For the rest of you guys. I'm gonna let you in on the big secret
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody so what is the big secret I hope you really get huh?
 So as you guys are on the penthouse right now if you can listen to last couple episodes and we
 tonight we are going to be
 Trying to get the shop to the book cover so you look that's like okay
 You just take a picture I'll say should be a simple thing
 But I want to walk you behind the scenes of what has gone into this
 Because I think what happens is a lot of times is creators will spend
 Insane in insane amounts of time
 Working on our thing right on our craft which is important right like if you guys been watching me and following me on the
 Extra Secrets or excuse me what book we are now book through the traffic secrets book like I spent insane amounts of time on this
 Getting it prepared getting it ready get it written giving it
 Like so so not downplaying that at all like I spend more time writing my books than anybody else
 I know everyone's like I got my friends is bragging on Facebook this morning guys dying laughing
 He's like it's onyx and golf this no onyx like I've written two books in the last in the last like two days
 And both are like anyway, and I was like oh that's like the opposite of how I do mine
 I've written you know one book in the last like year and a half and and I spent insane amount of time
 Anyway, I'm the opposite right so I get it like when you have art you spend your time because you love it
 And you create it and and and I get it so not downplaying that at all like continue to be an artist
 Can you put your heart and your soul into things you do continue to stay up?
 Late nights wake up early mornings and kill yourself for your art because I think it's important. So I'll lead with that
 all right now the next piece is
 Your art is as amazing as it is
 You should be spending an equivalent not like hour for hour
 But an equivalent amount of energy and time on the marketing of your art
 Okay, if you don't then your art will never be seen
 Right and so I'm saying that because if you if you've been following me and hopefully it's following Instagram because that's like literally
 If you want a reality show my life go to Instagram watch my stories every day you're seeing
 Like everything you see you're waking up with my kids. You see me going to school then you see like I
 Instagram had document whole thing
 It's literally the Russell Brunson reality show so if you want to go see what's happening go and I would recommend it because
 Like literally this last 24 hours in the document this whole process and I tell you about you see you would have seen it
 And it's it's fun and I want to show you the pen scenes of everything so to go to
 Instagram.com/Russell Brunson and follow me and watch the stories that I'm showing behind the scenes all the time
 But anyway, I've been watching kind of seen this but I'm at the penthouse
 My kids are gone and I'm working at editing the book
 But in the process I was like I need a shot for the cover and I had this vision ever since we got the penthouse
 I was like happy cool to have this shot where it's like me looking over Boise the city and there's monitors
 And I'm looking at traffic graphs stats and working in like and it's it's
 It's similar to the dot com secrets book cover or the trailer for that book like is same kind of conflict
 It's really epic picture that has the city in the back city lights in the background anyway, so I was kind of vision and so
 I messaged Brandon Fisher on my team two days ago. I said hey Brandon
 Message my like a 1139 like hey tomorrow
 I'm gonna have a pet house write the book and they said I'm like I want to get I want to create all the footage for the trailers and ads and
 Everything's gonna come down so he came down
 And he spent probably two hours in a day like looking at what we could possibly do and he went back and he got
 lights and cameras and cranes and
 Gimbals and jigs and I don't even know these things are all called monitors and like and brought up like four
 Bucket buckets like four
 trailers, I don't even know what's called there a big o wagons full of of lights and equipment and stuff like that and then he set up and
 last night they were here till almost one setting everything up like
 probably seven or eight hours worth of setup and testing shots and like looking with what the light looks like
 It's six o'clock and seven o'clock and eight o'clock and nine o'clock and I feel what's the perfect time and perfect everything like all this stuff
 Right? We did a bunch of sample practice shots and a bunch of things and like got looking really good last night
 And none of that is used are we gonna use I was just like the test and tonight everyone's showing up about five o'clock
 And we got photographers video guys everything and we're gonna spend for five till probably midnight
 So there's seven eight hours do all this stuff with the one goal of getting a picture for the cover of the book, okay?
 But then that picture is cool
 But now trying to get all the b-roll around that like like videos of me riding on on the the windows
 You know walking around doing this doing that like just all the different b-roll of things
 We can then use for the ads to sell the the cover of the book which sells the book
 And then from there then we're making your capture stuff for ads and keep going backwards
 It's like you have the art is like your focal point
 It's a center point right and you step out there
 I would say don't judge a book by cover
 But guess people who judge a book by cover
 So it's like you put all time to create the art that makes the the art the art that sells the art right the the cover or whatever
 It is you know for me. It's a book cover for you might be a whatever like the branding of the design
 But it's the one the one layer outside of this little nucleus of your of your of your art is that the wrap right?
 That actually looks exciting and from there you go one step out further
 Which is like you would these are the assets for came for the sales video to sell the cover of the book
 Which sells the book and then you go from there when we step out
 Which is I would need the the credit for the ads the ads sell the sales videos sell the cover which sells the book
 Right, so all said then we will put in I don't know probably 20 or so hours
 at least to capture the the
 The the picture for the for the cover of the book, but then we're creating all the art around it
 Which comes the ads the videos the b-roll the blah blah blah blah blah
 And so that's the part I think people don't often see they see the book cover
 I can't tell you how many people now have knocked off my my style book cover so annoying
 It's like they send it just like here's Russell's book makes something similar and then they just slap up like some some
 Stock image and they have a logo that looks similar to mine and there's their book. It's it's like dude. This is why
 You're not gonna have a product that's a perennial seller
 It's gonna last forever because you don't put the energy in the time the effort into making the art sexy, right?
 and so
 That's the that's the big hook. That's the big secret
 That's the big key is like spending the time to make your art sexy
 In fact, maybe I'm entitled to podcast that that making your arts sexy because that's what most people are missing
 It's not just slapping some images together. It's only up. It's like spend a lot of time
 You're not only we spent time in this this shoot. I guess I was writing the book
 We've caught B-roll me writing the book
 I'll be rolling here the the penthouse writing up you rolled me at the office writing and sketching out
 So I'm here on me and invent teaching this like all those things last year
 You're documenting the creation of the process of this thing all gonna become ads and parts of the videos and like all the things that support
 The art now that it's this eventually done
 And so anyway
 I just want to share it to you because I don't think that a lot of us creators are thinking about a piece of your thing about the creation of the
 Content or the thing the piece of the thing that you're selling
 But you should be spending as much effort and energy and creativity and probably even more so sometimes on all the the the stuff around that
 That actually grabs the people
 Brings them in sheer funnels converts them on the funnels makes them desire the thing you're selling and then they actually get the thing you're selling
 Yeah, I think that's one of the the big tragedies of our of our world is
 Amazing artists who create art and I'm not saying paintings
 I think art like it could be anything a book a work a video movie whatever they never get seen by the light of
 Day because it's been so much time in the art there's been any money on the
 Advertising and the marketing of the art which is this own art form in and of itself in fact almost a more fun art form
 Anyway, so there you go
 I just wanted to kind of show you as it glints kind of scenes because I guess some years were watching and say oh so cool
 Russell so cool
 I'm like I'm hoping you're getting like wow when I create my next product
 I should put this method effort into the trailer I should put this much effort into the coverage because this method effort into the ads
 Right because anything can get an ad and hold the book like hey my name's Russell. Here's my new book
 You should read it, but man, you see mine was gonna be happening and be seeing me writing the book
 You gonna be seeing me, you know at the desk, you know and the the cameras and things moving in and out
 You see like all the all the creative that went into
 Into supporting this this art you can see all that and when this book launches, it'll be the your social
 Your social everything will be drowned in it, but because it's gonna be fun exciting beautiful amazing things
 Hopefully you'll enjoy the ride. So there you go. All right, that's all I got
 I'm gonna go get ready and start the editing process. I got basically like 12 hours today to edit before the video shoot
 So wish me luck. That's the plan
 I appreciate you all thanks for listening and we'll talk to you all again soon. Bye everybody
