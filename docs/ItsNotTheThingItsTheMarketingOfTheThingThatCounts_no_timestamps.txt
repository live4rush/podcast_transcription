 What's up everybody this is Russell Bronson and welcome to the marketing secrets podcast. I hope you guys are amazing today
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital?
 We're spending money from our own pockets. How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services
 And the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Bronson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody so it is the day before Thanksgiving
 We have 20 bubble soccer balls being delivered to my house
 We're gonna be playing a huge bubble soccer game on the smurf turf
 which is really exciting or the astroturf the culture because the blue here and boy is you but
 And we're looking forward to that and everything's getting ready with wrestling practice morning with the kiddos and
 I had some cool experiences happen there one that was just a really special moment. I want to share it
 Yeah, isn't one that was
 The reason why most people aren't successful in business
 So I'll give you both and hopefully you learn a lesson from the two so number one
 It's really cool at the kids school. There's a little kid. It's kind of a crazy story his apparently his mom and
 Him both found that cancer about same time together the cute little family little kid named Nico and so at the
 junior high a middle school to be called
 David I kind of everyone
 Is it gotten around this kid in his story trying to help mountain?
 It's just cute like all the kids where Huskies for Nico T-shirts like my down had a shirt on today
 So the Huskies for Nico and they do fundraisers for Nico and they always things and
 Such a cool thing how they've like gotten the school all behind this one person in this one
 Cause and movement and it's it's cool. I
 You know I was talking about building mass movements and things like that
 But I think a lot of times this is these little private intimate movements that it means so much people and it really helps people to
 To become something warm and they're just cool watching this and watching my kids participate in this in this movement for
 For a little kid in their school named Nico and so today wrestling practice, you know
 All these
 probably 60 or 70 wrestlers out there all trained to be warriors trying to toughen everything and
 the middle practice Nico and his dad came in when he walked in and just like the whole room went silent and it was like out of
 respect for him and
 It's like just one of the neatest needs experiences. I've witnessed in a long time and
 Chills and they're watching and all the kids are looking at him and like talking to him and then they came in and they
 They presented him because Nico was a wrestler as well before him all these problems happen
 So they gave him
 Wrestling t-shirts and sweatshirts and stuff like that and then they had Nico lead a cheer and so they brought everyone in and did their
 Cheering just such a special anyway, it was just cool thing. So that was a fun thing happened today
 And then afterwards I was talking with the dads and that's a successful real estate do here in Boise
 And it's kind of funny because he's like hey, I recognize you guys see you in my newsfeed every single day
 Sorry about that which I was better looking
 but it was kind of funny because he was in there and we were talking for a while afterwards and and
 It was interesting because there's a big reason why more people aren't successful
 And it's a mindset a little tweak and it's something yeah, definitely
 So I want to share with you because you're stuck in this mindset week is what's keeping you back
 I did a podcast episode on a hundred podcasts or so go talking about a not outsource in your lovemaking and
 In that I talked about how like you look at a business like no matter what you're selling for selling houses
 cars
 Supplements like it doesn't matter what you're selling you're selling like it
 Like that part doesn't matter doesn't that matter what business you're in the market is only in the matter
 So it's only in actually it's the lifeblood of a business what drives leads and customers and sales
 It's only in action matters like I can take my marketing systems to plug in any business and it'll work because
 Psychology is the same how you get the same. I'm a convert those leads. It's the same, right?
 And so it's not gonna be like yeah, well, I saw cliffhomes, you know, I just haven't done it yet. Oh my god
 Whatever
 You know
 And he's like yes, okay
 So you guys do a stuff for real estate agents
 I think I watched the viral video with the squirrel the prospector sounds like it's only for selling products. I'm like no like it
 I guess for like
 It generates leads to sales products. It's like whatever you need it to be. He's like oh, so you have anyone in real estate doing
 I'm like you have tons of people like I
 You know top head
 I know probably half a dozen or so they're killing it with like real estate agents using using it and in fact
 I told my like there's a guy who's got one of the biggest broker just here in Boise
 I'm like he's using it and it's funny and he's like oh, you know
 I hired some marketing companies to that for me and they're gonna get his lead to my so the working good
 He's like no not really think I wish we should get rid of all the leads being all the other agents underneath to say they want
 Internet leads so we have to do that
 but I just I don't like it and I think it's dumb and he's like yeah right now we're selling about 100 houses a year and
 He's like, you know, if we got a point we had 200 houses a year
 then we could afford to hire a full-time marketing person to generate leads and stuff and
 It's just as the marketing guy here. I just like I want to grab the guy and say like
 What do you like how do you not understand this?
 It's like saying yeah, like like let's say you're struggling in your marriage and you're like yeah
 Well my wife and I when we started like having you know when marriage gets gets good like we're happy and like everything's perfect
 Then we'll go to counseling I say no counseling or whatever it is what gets you there, right?
 It's just funny like yeah when like when we get when we grow into hide if we can afford some to generate leads
 Then we'll generate leads it's like no you can't afford not to like you should stop everything you're doing
 The only thing you should do is generate leads and it's funny because he's like yeah the biggest person town
 They have about a thousand they sell at house house about but they're doing all of it online
 general these leads online and they're able to do because because they had their selling so many houses and like no you understand
 It's because they're doing it. There's able to sell so many houses not because that's so many houses they can do it
 It's like the chicken and the egg. It's like it's like yeah
 It's like you're trying like if I cut off the oxygen to your brain your brain will stop so don't like it is
 The lifeblood and I told him I was like he's asking that you guys do stuff like that for me
 I'm like no like we like no I'm like we certify people that you can do it
 But it's like I mean if you really want to be successful
 It's like you have to become the head of the marketing like you cannot outsource your lovemaking like you can't do that in business
 And expect it to be awesome right in your marriage if you're okay
 This is my wife on an outsource lovemaking somebody else like your business your marriage is gonna fail
 It's the same thing in your business like it is the lifeblood
 It is the thing that gets
 Customers into your world and gets them to like you and believe you and trust you and give you money
 And it's like the most important part of business
 Like I think the biggest problem with it funny if you if listen to even if like Michael Gerber talks about this like
 People are technicians name an entrepreneurial seizure
 And they think they want to start a business because they work at a cake factory and they see the dude who runs a cake shop
 And these guys are more on I can do better job of that so they start their own business and then our entrepreneurs
 There's do to build cakes. It's like the dude who builds a cake like anyone can build a cake like you can hire a lot of people to do that
 Like it's the person who's gonna actually so the crap out of the cakes that runs the business
 Like if you don't have that like your business dies
 It's funny like in 2008 when all you when the economy crashed all these companies are crashing
 I see all these people in the companies like this the their first instinct is not like let's lower cost on like stupid stuff
 They all cut their marketing and their sales, but like their marketing budget
 I'm like okay, we're struggling. Let's cut off the lifeblood to our head like in wrestling when I'm taking my wrestling somebody
 There's a little footage watching the video right here both sides your neck
 There's a thing called a carotid artery and if I want if I'm rustin some I get a front headlock
 I put a little bit of pressure right there against the crowd artery and that fast the blood flow stops to your head
 It's like if someone choked you like and then shake you die with your carotid artery if I touch it right that
 Fashion will blackout it's really fun
 You're else see someone you're getting you get a boom and these whole body goes limping flip them over and you pin them
 Right because it's the blood that goes to your brain. You cut the blood it
 It's it's like a second and you're out cold
 And I take it back off and the blood keeps coming in your back a lot, right?
 So companies go they cut off they cut off the lifeblood and then the company dies like that fast
 It's like that is what's keeping you alive like in times of bad economy
 They triple down on the advertising triple down on the marketing like that's anyway you guys all know that I'm just be
 I'm preaching to the choir, but for everyone else
 I want to kind of talk about that because it's so funny like and and I told him that he's like oh, you know
 Lead generation for me is is you know nurturing the clients we have and things like that and you know
 I cannot source that that's my love making me or something and I'm like dude think that's
 Anyway, anyway
 so
 That's why I have to say I don't say if you want to go to a company focus on the marketing sales of the thing and
 Emotion is are in business because you love the thing you do that's awesome
 But if you want to have a lot of people use that thing you got to become obsessed with the marketing of the thing
 That is the key the marketing of the thing is the business the business is not thing
 The bit the thing is the fulfillment of whatever you want to do with it
 The business is the marketing of the thing that's the only thing that actually matters because without that your company dies
 that that the lifeblood goes off to your brain and instantly your alcohol and
 That's why I like us versus other SaaS companies other SaaS companies are focusing on
 You know hiring these huge teams of people to do whatever. I don't know what they even do right?
 We focus on marketing marketing drives it
 So there you go guys anyway, hope that some of you guys who are thinking and wondering and like oh, you know
 I'm gonna hire a marketing team like it's hard to do it
 You can do it, but if you really want to grow like you got to come assess the marketing everything you've got to
 Not turn out source your love making and realize that that is the business
 And if you want to be in business you want to be an entrepreneur like the entrepreneur seizure you had of like trying to start this
 cake company or your
 Whatever thing is you sell like if you want that baby to survive and to live
 You know being obsessed with the thing is not gonna do it
 It's being obsessed with the marketing of the thing so it helps
 Appreciate you all I go I got a couple hours to work get my to-do this killed and crushed so that I can have a
 Thanks, excuse me. That's not stressful those you guys know us
 Entrepreneurs like my buddy Alex Sharf and always says like we're all about momentum and so it's like thanks
 He scares me because there's no momentum so I get so much momentum over the next like four hours for me
 I go back home that I'll knock down any nominal tomorrow. They're standing up what I'm trying to relax with the family
