 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast today
 I want to talk about the marketing that's invisible
 Inside of the fulfillment of the thing that you were actually selling
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so a couple things to head somebody on Instagram write me and they ask a question
 I was a different show some hard selling and soft selling
 We're showing out the wheels my head spinning and then today actually this whole week
 everybody's starting to get the
 The books in the mail to the traffic secrets are showing up the box that's showing up like ah so exciting to see everybody getting their boxes and their packages and
 A couple people in my inner circle made videos of them open the boxes
 It was like did you guys all capture the marketing lesson that Russell's gave us here inside of this box
 And it's fun because I don't think most people got it
 But a few people did so I'm gonna let you know the secrets just in case because a lot of times
 We focus so much on like the hard selling right I'm gonna go I'm gonna create my offer my funnel
 I'm gonna I'm gonna like make you know, you know, hook store off
 I'm gonna hook them tell them a story make them an offer that's like hard selling right soft selling like all the
 Subtle these that you're doing
 Around everything right like for example in my podcast in my Facebook lives in my interviews and my everything
 I'm always talking about stuff right like I always talk about clickfuddles
 When when I had made a circle when it was still open if you ever noticed like the first probably 300 episodes of this podcast
 I was always talking about my inner circle members
 Oh my inner circle member to this my inner circle member to this I was talking about these people in this tier in this group and as I did that
 More people like I want to be in their circle. What's in their circle?
 So I'm looking for it, right and that's what soft sell is just like casually talking about things talking about clickfun
 I'm talking about order form bumps talking about all these things that lead back to whatever it is that you actually sell
 And so I think a lot of times people think like oh, I mean there's some of my product either selling my product or I'm or I'm
 Teaching right it's like no, they they all go together. Do you understand that like they're all they all kind of tied together
 And so soft selling is all the things you're doing all the time, right?
 like
 Just for example right now. What have I already done?
 I already talked about clickfunnels with you guys said talked about the traffic secrets book
 I talked about the box that and I talked about my inner circle so four things just in the first two minutes of this podcast
 We're just soft selling and it's like planting seeds and talking about it talking about it more and and as you do more
 More of it. It just gets people to to wonder more and to look more and to be more excited when the opportunity for them to purchase
 Arises so that's kind of difference between a hard sell and soft sell now to go deeper on that
 This is
 This is what's what's fun, right?
 So everybody bought the book and you went through the book funnel, right?
 If you haven't bought the book yet come on now like why are you even listening to me at this point?
 If you don't trust me enough to go buy the book
 That's ridiculous, but I digress so you go to traffic secrets.com. You'll get the book
 You get the book you go through upsell down so flow you see the whole thing from there
 I invite you to come watch the webinar
 Hopefully go the webinar and you know the whole whole funnel happens. So that's the hard sell now soft sell are the things happening now
 right so
 In the mail everybody got a box and outside the box is like wait before you open the box
 Scan this QR code and I know a lot of people don't how to use QR code yet
 I still am just learning how to use them
 But if you like go to your photo app and you hold the QR code it'll pop open a website where there's a video from me in the video
 I just basically tell people I think so much for buying this book. I reaffirm their decision like you're gonna love it
 I can't wait to dive into it and I ask them for a favor like look
 Just you know like an author like me the biggest thing that we want is we want to be able to
 Like have people actually get the thing we create right we spend 18 months of our life lockdown like writing this this thing for you
 Like I want to hear your feedback
 And so like the thing that being the most to me right now is before you open this box if you actually record yourself opening the box
 And as you open it go and then share it on Facebook on Instagram social media and tag me on it
 And and I want to see those things right now again. This is like this is the art of soft selling right now
 Right so
 Mastin for a favor like you just bought this book
 I killed myself to give it to you now you have it if you do me a favor like just make a video you unboxing it post it
 Now obviously not everyone does not even are like not even the majority people do like it
 But a good percentage people do and it was cool is they're posting them everywhere
 They're posting when the clickphones group the posting on their own page they're posting them on Instagram
 They're in their stories that like I'm getting tagged in unboxing videos everywhere now obviously we sold like I think
 60 or 70,000 copies of the book so far and I'm not getting 60 or 70,000 but I'm getting literally hundreds multiple hundreds
 people posting these videos and
 When they're doing it guess what's happening their friends their family members there are other people like wait
 What's that book? What's it about and it's it's starting to make sales?
 It's the second way of sales they're coming
 I didn't do anything for other than I just asked people to be willing to unbox
 That they're they're thinking posting unboxing a tag me in it, which has been really really cool
 All the coolest ones that I don't see all some land on my other folder junk folder the cool ones
 I see I share them again
 It's helping those people as well
 So there's a lot of cool benefits then inside of the book like if you the box you open up and there's like a quick start guide
 And a quick start guide walks you through like how to use the book right like you can buy a
 Computer you get a quick start guide you buy software you get a quick start guide like but for a book
 We don't but I we include a quick start guide so get the quick start guide and say okay first thing you need to use
 You read this book second thing you need to do is if you haven't read
 You know this is part one of three they go get the other two books and and that makes sure you read the whole trilogy
 And get them all if you want the workbook for free then here's how to get the whole box set
 You know so I'm telling about like the best way to consume the book and how it fits with the other books
 And for them to go get it right so it's getting it's not a hard sell
 It's just saying hey this you're reading this this is the best way to consume it just like if I was selling crackers
 I'd be like the best way these crackers is with some some
 I don't even know
 Crackers with with some cashew milk or so I don't even know is that even a thing me? I mean like like
 If I was this yeah, let's say I had a food company right and
 Or shampoo company right best way to shampoo is also used conditioner also you boom you've doubled your sales right?
 It's these little these little things like that
 And so the quick start guide is also then like little tickets to other things like tickets to webinars tickets to all the other
 Offers we have so just like oh by the way here's a bookmark you can use but it also serves as a pretty good
 Add so now these bookmarks that come in the in the boxes people use bookmarks in the books
 But it's pushing to the webinar funnel and the and this thing in just other places their click funnels trial things like that
 You know and so it's just it's these little things you kind of include in the sales process
 the fulfillment process that
 The increase a whole bunch of things right it gets your book your product is to spread more viral it gets people talking about it
 Because people's sharing it it gets people knowing what's next step where do I go from here in the value ladder?
 Like what's next piece and so all those things as you kind of look at them. That's that's the magic so
 Anyway, I hope you you guys start thinking about that. I always tell people especially you my my people
 I always tell my people my funnel hackers like whenever time you buy anything from me to buy slowly and watch the process
 And look what happens and what is the sequences that come out? What are the things you get in the mail?
 What is the packaging? I remember when I was starting this game Mac 15 20 years ago. I'd go to Dan Kenney events
 And I literally and I still have it to this day every single person who spoke
 I went I ran the back and grabbed the order form. I didn't buy everyone's product
 I want to see the salesman show how they structured how they laid it out and what they did now they did it
 I listen to every single sales pitch and all these buddies are like oh, I'm too good to sit in the room
 I can sit on the lobby and network with people without you know all this stuff. I'm like you guys are so dumb
 I'm not in here to learn all the stuff. I'm in here to watch that guy sell something because he's good at it
 He's got something
 I don't know right like watching the sales process and I'm grabbing the order forms and I'm looking at those things I remember
 I want my first TNC events I went to
 When Ryan Dyson and Perry Belch and those guys they were selling is before we launched
 It was like well we're working on click funnels
 But they were selling their funnel package thing where they would help you design a funnel and build it and all this stuff
 Pretty click funnels by the way, so it's really hard to do back then
 and we're like
 Watching and then pitch it taking notes on the pitch and then I bought the videos of the event specifically so I could like have a
 recording of how they pitched their funnel thing right like
 And then getting the order forms and getting into like I did everything because I want to see I want to understand
 I want to study I'm a funnel hacker. I'm watching the process and so I think a lot of times
 You guys are going through these things and you're missing the process and it's like man if you're paying me to learn marketing advice
 You may learn as much if not more from watching the process as you do from the actual thing you paid for so
 Anyway, that's what look at things. There's so many products services that bought that I've never ever opened and consumed people
 Like what do you feel bad like you spent money you didn't you didn't consume and I was like no no no like you don't understand like that was like
 Getting a box of cereal inside. There's a little prize you pull like oh like the product is a little prize like oh cool
 I got a little like you little prize whoo right like what I was paying for was the the privilege to buy the person's product and see
 The experience to see how it all works and like watching the process and the flow and I think that a lot of times we forget that
 It's not true for all markets
 but for you guys like if you're following me you're trying to figure out a silly products your service since like like
 It always blows my people I get upset like oh you sent me too many emails this week like okay
 That that's something to be annoyed by unless you came to me to learn marketing and then you're gonna look at that big hmm
 I had there's an ad
 There's an ad that we're running right now. That's killing it just you know and I was I was with my daughter
 I was like I want to film some some ads with you some painter a dollar per ad to help film these ads
 So we did this one in my office where she has the iPad she clicked record
 I'm like can you hear a career and I run them into the hall and like you know
 I'm like showing them all the two common clubs like you know coming in and running around the room and running on the whole office and
 It's really fun right and we post the ad is killing it
 It's blown up and man I was reading the comments today
 And there's some people people are knowing but like this is going on drugs and someone was like
 Yeah, what kind of caffeine what kind of cocaine you taking to be all excited and like you're speaking too fast
 And some guy I remember this one that I should screenshot it
 But it was like it was like just you know Russell if you really want to get leads you need to talk slower
 like this is gonna be nothing except for hurt your brand bubble all the stuff and
 I sat there for a second and then I looked at our stats and it's not the number one added
 I was converting that the most leads at least amount of money
 And it's like people coming in like you have someone who's done this game for a while
 You know you may even pay him to come to his event sort of buy his books or his courses or whatever and you're critiquing his ads like
 You're just isn't work like okay, or maybe it's killing it and you just miss the whole process
 And I never would treat someone's product. I would just step or someone's add this the back comes look like hmm
 How does it make me feel how did it work? But I would never anyway people are funny. So all right
 Hope that helps. I appreciate you guys. Thank you for listening
 Half of the marketing it's such a fun game
