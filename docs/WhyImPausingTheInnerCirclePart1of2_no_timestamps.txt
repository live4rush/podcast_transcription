 Hey everybody, this is Russell Brunson and welcome you back to the marketing seekers podcast. I've got a special episode for you today
 I'm not gonna. I'm a little nervous to do this one
 but there's been a bunch of questions
 getting over the last 24 hours and
 This is probably the best format for me. You can't talk about it
 So I'm gonna be talking during today's episode about why I am pausing my inner circle
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, everybody so yes, that is the news
 As you've probably seen in the ClickFunnels community has been a lot of changes and announcements happening
 On the ClickFunnels five-year birthday. We did some big announcements talking about
 You know how we're simplifying the software we're getting rid of some of the features and just focusing on being the category king of sales funnels
 we then talked about how we launched funnel flicks which is a training platform for people in funnels and and
 Basically has all the courses that we used to sell for anywhere from you know a couple hundred bucks to a thousand bucks for free
 for anyone who's at the
 $297 month level ClickFunnels and
 Since then we've had thousands of people upgrade that level which is really really cool
 And so now we're able to do more training
 So I was the first big big announcement and there's another big announcement happening at funnel hacking live
 Which you guys are gonna freak out about if you're ever take it
 You can't go to funhackinglive.com and get them and then on my 40th birthday. There's another big announcement
 So those are three big things happening, but there's a lot of little announcements happening as well and one of them
 I made last Friday and it was more silent because it wasn't to everybody. It was just to a small group of
 In our market and so a lot of you guys know I've had an inner circle coaching program now for over six years since before ClickFunnels launched and
 it's funny and
 I
 Shared this with inner circle group. We got a group here on Monday and Tuesday
 Today's Wednesday and I kind of today off and spent time with with Nora
 I went to the with the pumpkin patch with her and and then tomorrow Thursday and Friday have my last inner circle meeting and
 honestly it's been
 so far only halfway through the week, but it's been like the most for the most emotional weeks of my life and
 And so I kind of was just talk about that
 I know a lot of people who listen this podcast specifically
 This has been a thing that they've been striving for like I want to be in your circle
 I want to get there like this in my plan like somebody want to do it
 and I just want to tell you the story behind it and then and then from there talk about why I'm pausing it for a while and and
 hopefully it'll it'll
 Be good for you and inspire you and help you to make some decisions that are that are tough as well
 And so that's kind of game plan, but I'm gonna go back in time a little bit. So
 When this whole thing started for me. So I joined a mastermind group is Bill Glazers mastermind group
 Bill glazing Dan Kennedy's way back over over 10 years ago now, which is crazy and I was in that group for six years and then
 when
 When Bill Glazers sold the company I kind of dropped out and I was like
 I need another mastermind group and I had tried to launch my own group a couple times with varied success
 I had once and I had like five or six people sign up and then and then I did it for a year or two
 and it was kind of hard and canceled it and it may but
 While we were building click funnels and I was writing the dot-com secrets book both of the things are happening at same time
 I started just having this
 This I don't even know what the word is like this desire this this need
 For like a mastermind group
 I try to join a couple other people's and just like you never got what I when I need it out of them and finally kind of felt the
 The poll which I'm sure you guys have felt that poll that calling that whatever you want to call it
 but that that need of just like I feel like I should start a group and
 I remember looking at a bunch of people who had groups online and that were doing really well and I was just like oh
 Like yeah, we so cool and they were charging $25,000 for these things and I was just like
 There's no way that's gonna be possible
 but I want to try and so I went out there and I tried to launch this thing and
 And first I launched the program was 10,000
 It's called our night program
 We started selling that and it was doing well and then it grew up
 It was too big and I was like I want to do it
 I wanted to like on the inner circle like I want to have my own group and I worked even closer with and so we launched a
 $25,000 inner circle program and at first like nobody nobody was signing off for it
 I kept trying thing after thing and like nobody people would sign up for the $10,000 thing
 But nobody would sign up for the $25,000 and I was just like like other people are set like
 We're selling things for that much like why can't I what's wrong with me?
 And you know we're giving her building click phones at the time and write the doc on seekers book and and I remember finally we sold one
 The craziest thing to me is that the person that bought it paid 25 grand and they never showed up
 Like the first person signed up never
 Never asked for reef. I'm never I just never we couldn't get this person to ever contact like it was the weirdest thing
 I was just like we got one person set up. They won't even show up like I don't make any sense to me
 And then and then we sold another one and another and we started selling a few and it wasn't a ton
 I think we had five or six probably
 At the first meeting and so I had my night event which had I don't know
 Maybe a hundred people came back and then we did the inner circle afterwards
 Which had like five or six people in it and it was the first little mastermind group and and it was it was so awesome
 In fact, I want to take a step back. I shared this yesterday with the inner circle members
 But it was funny because because
 This whole thing like the writing the dot-com seekers book and the building of click phones and stuff came on the backside of a big
 Business failure where I had to fire like 80 people and I didn't like the business
 I was in and if you've read the dot-com seekers book the intro section I talked about how
 I woke up one day and I was I didn't love my customers and I said I wish if I would had a boss
 I wish I had a boss so that person could fire me because I didn't want to go in and
 About that time I heard Evan pagan talk about how you need to build out a customer avatar
 I thought it was the cheesiest advice ever but I was like alright fine
 I'm gonna do this customer avatar exercise and I talk about it in the dot-com seekers book
 And so I sat down and said okay, who was my dream customer look like first?
 I thought from a mail like a man's standpoint, right?
 And so I gave it a name. It's I'm gonna call Mike and I was like what would I cry?
 You know, what are some of the things about Mike? I'm at least successful
 He used to be an athlete
 He you know, I kind of list all these different things that that my dream customer would have and I took that to Google images
 And I typed in Mike and I got all the phrases and a whole bunch of pictures popped up and I picked a dude who looked like
 Someone I don't want to hang out with that
 I thought would be cool and I took that picture and I printed it out and I taped it on my wall and I was like
 Well, I don't just want to serve men. I want to serve women as well
 I think women are amazing. They have you know a lot of times have more power to change impact than men
 Not all the time but a lot of times and it's just like man if I could help serve women as well
 I've never had it and prior to that just the reason why that was a big deal tonight time is prior to that
 You know when I was doing coaching stuff of that
 I never had very many women that came into our groups a few
 But it was just it was definitely more more male-belmed and I was like I want to work with women too like they're so amazing
 and I've seen the impact that
 That that successful women can have on on people and it's like I want that as well
 So I wrote down the customer avatar on the female side and I call her Julie and I would sell all these different names
 And I went to Google images. I found a picture of
 That was like my dream Julie and I printed that out and taped it on my wall
 And I had these two pictures and they became my like that was my dream
 Like I wanted to build a mastermind with those two people were there and I can hang out with them
 And so that's when this told you and you started right and we started getting some people in and and had the group
 And it was five or six people at this first mastermind group and it was the beginning and then we started
 We kept pushing it kept pushing it and finally eventually had to like to eight and then to ten people and it slowly grew
 And I would do meetings to times a year of them and you know some of the most rewarding work ever
 I've had a chance to do in these mastermind groups
 And that I started talking about in fact if you've been listening this podcast for us five or six years
 I started talking about inner circle members
 because I was the closest with them as they would have successes I would talk about on the podcast and
 More I talked about the inner circle members more people said I want to be in the inner circle
 And then we started getting more traction and more growth and more people started coming into it
 The point where we had a full group of like 18 people which is like my mind
 I maxed at 18 people and I was like oh my gosh, this is crazy and then we did
 We did a funnel hacking live about that time and we signed up like 10 more people and then we had like 30
 I was like I can't do 30
 I think I tried once to 30 in a group
 It was like really really hard so like having to break into two groups then we had two groups of like 15 or something like that
 and
 And then one day I had this idea I was like I was like how I like who would it look like if I made this perfect
 I was like we could have
 Like if I did four groups I was four groups of 25 to be 100 people
 I could still say that it wouldn't you know it wouldn't crush me you know too much my time
 I'd be able to still spend time doing you know click funnels everything else I'm doing
 So I said you know I could I could handle 100 people in this inner circle and that's I'd be maxed at that point
 And so then I think I did a podcast about it. I'm sure and I sent some emails out
 I said you know and again we had maybe 35 people at the time I said just you know where
 I'm capping it 100 people we had 100
 I'm shutting it down and I didn't again think that was gonna ever happen and within like two months we we hit 100 people
 It was crazy and intense and it was insane and we'd do these events where basically you know people come in
 It's two days times four groups two four six eight days over two to three weeks
 And it was like basically a month of my life two to three times a year was focusing in circle members
 And then I I did these things called Beck in a day with a jump on a call on Friday
 And I spent Fridays consulting with different people in the group and
 It was just again so fulfilling so rewarding and gave me the chance to have my hands
 On a hundred people's businesses at the time in all sorts of industries like it really for me was the training ground
 It was the thing that gave me the ability to understand
 You know what what works in this business and what's different like we're the intricacies
 and the difference between info business versus the supplement business versus the local business versus like I
 Had this rare unique opportunity for for many years to just to work with so many companies and see and be on the front lines and
 Be able to talk to voxers with all these entrepreneurs and to figure things out
 And it was amazing and so again
 We hit the hundred people and we clicked capped it down and for like a year no one could come in and
 We started getting your normal attrition would happen and after a year
 We're down to like 70 or how many people were in there and I was like how we need to
 To kind of re you know get it back up to 100 and and so we did a campaign got back to 100 and then I had this idea
 I said you know what?
 I don't want to like I don't want to fill in this up with new people
 I want to make it where it's like this is a group of people I'm gonna work with and and I just want to I want to like
 I want to every single year come back to single people and together collectively as a whole I want it's all growing
 Together and I said how are we gonna do that when we have people coming and going and things like that?
 It's really really difficult. So we did a campaign with everybody. I said we're starting a program
 We're calling this inner circle for life now. We're changing the names called inner circle for life
 And when you're in you're in and if you leave that's fine
 You can leave but if you leave you can never come back in for a lot of people said I'm gonna leave
 I'll come back next year. I'm taking your off and I was just like I hated that so
 Me inner circle for life where if you're in you in and if you're out
 you know, we're still friends, but you can never come back in and
 What happened next was insane like nobody the most part nobody left and
 And your circle was closed for next two and a half two and a half years or so and that brought me to
 right right now and
 You know what I'm gonna share that in the next episode. I'm gonna drag this
 I'm gonna drag this story on cuz usually I have so it's about ten minutes long. We're at eight 12 minutes and
 I want to share the rest of the story in the next one
 So there's the there's the the build up of where inner circles come from in the last six years
 And why didn't how we did it and some of the amazing things and some of the experiences
 So that's it for this episode on next episode
 I'm gonna talk about the transitions in my personal life and my family and everything and why I'm pausing inner circle for now
 I'm not pausing it forever not indefinitely, but for a season. I'm gonna be pausing it
