 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast
 I hope you guys are pumped and excited for today because I am the sun's up
 It's beautiful because it's got out of the dentist and want to hang out with my friends
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody
 I hope that you guys are all been amazing
 And we're gonna so many fun things right now that like
 I'm not sure where what to share first or second or third or where to go or what to do
 but I wanted to just jump in today because I
 Had an interesting conversation yesterday with mr. Steve Larson who's one of my favorite people
 Not only inside the ClickFunnels community, but just in the world. He's super cool
 And I appreciate I was hanging out with him talking to him and it's been fun. Those who don't know Steve
 he
 Came into my world as one of my as my funnel builder for a couple years and they went off on his own and it's been fun
 watching him build his movement his his tribe, but
 he was there like when I was writing the expert seekers book and so it's fun because
 When I say take on the project start writing and you go through this phase of brainstorming and searching and researching and finding things out and discovering like
 so he was there during the whole process and
 Literally sitting next to me during most of it, which was which was a pretty cool
 I don't know pretty cool opportunity. It's yeah
 I hear him he tells me stories about a lot like number when we're doing that and you were coming up with this and like and
 It's kind of fun because yesterday he messaged me and he's like hey
 I'm looking you know for coach and staring my life who do you recommend like what would I you know?
 what should I do and and I kind of stopped for a second and I was like you know what there's like there's a lot of good people
 It says like kind of recommending a few people and stuff like that
 But I came back and I was like you know what and it's and I'm you know me and him have talked about this a lot
 But I was like honestly like the thing that's gonna get you're learning and you're understanding next level more than anything
 It's probably not the next coach as much as like you sitting down and actually writing a book
 And I'm not this is not a podcast about writing a book. I did one of those three you know recently, but
 I wanted to talk about this because you know so many people
 They wanted to come to expert. They want to write a book. They want to make courses. They want to do like podcasts or things like that
 Right we talk about the the value and the importance of publishing like like if you bet around me for any
 You know any amount of time, you know
 I'm such a big believer like everybody needs to be publishing daily like what are you publishing like pick a podcast?
 New a daily or write a blog post daily or do a youtuber Facebook out
 What doesn't even matter the goal though is as you start doing that you start finding your voice, right?
 and
 You know there's there's actually if you've read the expert secrets book
 I talked about actually the excuse me the traffic secrets book
 I talk about like the two reasons why you need to publish daily is because number one is gonna help you to find your voice
 Number two is gonna help your oddness to find you and so I'm a big believer in that but there's something
 Magical about actually writing a book
 It's been interesting so I'm writing my fourth book right now and I'm not telling details about it yet
 But I'm writing it and it's just been so fun. I kind of forgot about this process like and you start writing
 Because you have to like take this constant and break it down
 How do you make it simple and how do you make it interesting and how do you go to the case days and the use cases and like
 If other people talked about it already, I want to make sure I'm not saying the same thing other people said
 So you get in this like research phase you're studying and you're learning you try to figure things out and by going through that process
 It's insane the insights you start getting like I almost feel like
 God or you know
 Whoever you want to believe I obviously this God, but but he's he's like if you're willing to go on this journey
 I'm gonna start making these insights clear. It's the same reason why Tony Robbins always talks about like I don't
 You know
 He doesn't want people dabbling wants you to go through immersion where you're going through a four-day event or like you're reading a book
 Or like you're doing these things because immersion you start connecting these dots
 You don't see normally and I can all I can say is that the process of writing a book for me
 I start seeing patterns and things line up. I've never seen it in the other
 Situation even publishing daily like there's something there's something about it where these patterns is it did and these things start start showing up
 and it's funny because
 Last year I wrote the traffic secrets book
 As the year I mean it's two years ago dang it anyway, whatever it was
 And then after I got done I went back and I rewrote the expert secrets and the dot-com secrets books for our hardbound versions
 You know and it was interesting as I was going through them reading the expert secrets book and I'm doing the editing
 I'm just like where's some of the stuff come from like this
 Nothing like patting myself in back like some of this stuff's amazing like I don't know where I come up with this
 I don't remember the process and it's going back
 Like when Stephen and I were staying there in that room in that office right in the book and it was like brainstorming and researching and thinking and looking at pattern
 All since like like because I'm keeping this like treasure hunt try to find the the piece of gold
 It's like the pattern shows up and it's like oh my gosh here it is like this gift that's just handed to you on a silver platter and
 I feel like that's happening right now in this book because I'm going through it
 I'm like I'm discovering and finding these things I never have seen before
 Which is just so interesting and so
 It comes down to
 Honestly, it is it is immersion it's immersion in different areas this immersion in in your learning and immersion in your
 Content creation immersion in your product development like if you're creating a course like if you dive deep into it start doing this stuff
 Again, hopefully if you if you look deep if you start trying to figure and really learn the stuff
 These insights will start popping out if you're going and you're studying somebody instead of just like oh
 I'm gonna listen to a podcast once a week or I'm gonna go, you know read a chapter every few days
 But like you go to like true immersion where you're like okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna binge read this book in a day
 Or I'm gonna go and you know go to a three-day event or five-day event or whatever
 But you started going through immersion
 You start seeing things with different like I don't know how to explain it more than like these patterns start appearing
 But you don't see when it's disjointed
 I something similar happened. This is kind of more on a spiritual side
 But you know a lot of you know, I'm a church a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints some people make name us the Mormons
 Like typically what I would do is I read a chapter in my scriptures every single day, right?
 Which is awesome you get these like you get different insights. They're really really useful and helpful and
 and then
 One day I bought a first edition book of Mormon
 Which is super rare and kind of a cool special thing for me to bought this book and I was like
 I'm gonna I'm gonna read this entire book and there's a guy back in the day things Carly P. Pratt
 He wrote the entire book of Mormon in a day back in the 1800s or something
 So I found out when his birthday was and I took the day off work
 I'm gonna read this entire book in a day and
 It's a big book and it's not light reading and I spent 18 hours reading I got about halfway through so
 I don't know how that dude did it in a day
 But but anyway regardless I spent 18 hours reading this book and I got
 Super deep into it and it was very similar. I had these breakthroughs and these patterns
 These things showing up that I've never seen before
 Because I'd seen things like in isolation of a chapter of verse or whatever
 But when you read it is like, you know, you know
 300 pages and once you start seeing the pattern starting to appear so anyway
 I want to share with you because I want you to thinking about that like you're learning your creation is like doing it in a
 State of immersion because these patterns start showing up so anyway, I hope it helps I just got home from the dentist
 I'm gonna go have some food real quick ahead in the office and get back to writing so
 But that said I want to challenge you guys immersion either studying or learning or creating or whatever
 block out time and go deep and start looking at the patterns and the things that appear because it's a gift
 It's amazing and you'll find things you weren't expecting and it's it's pretty pretty special
 So that's that appreciate you guys have an amazing day and I'll talk to you all again soon. Bye everybody
