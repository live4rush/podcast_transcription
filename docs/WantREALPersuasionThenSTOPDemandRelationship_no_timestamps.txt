 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast
 I'm excited today to talk about marketing and persuasion and
 Things I think can help us in this insanely crazy time that we are living today
 So that's said this cube theme song we come back we're talking about persuasion demand your relationship and how to actually create change
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, everybody so um, I'm sure you have been
 logging on to the internet over the last little bit and
 You have probably seen
 All the things that are happening. I do not want to get specifics. I do not want to get into
 Politics I didn't want to get into anything because that's outside of my calling my calling is I've been called to serve entrepreneurs and help them and
 and give them a voice and help them to be able to
 To create the change the things that they believe in and so I want to give you guys a skill set today
 They help you as you are trying to create change in whatever capacity you want it to be
 And that's where I'm going and that's as far as I'm going so
 It's been interesting
 just in the the climate
 It's just so funny how how how everybody's got to kind of pick their words a little carefully now so
 Which I don't enjoy
 But you know obviously the climate right now is different than than any of the time in our history at least my history personally and
 There's a lot of stuff happening and and I see a lot of people who are trying to create change for for things
 They believe in which is amazing, which is why I think we are here. We're all here. We're called
 To go serve different groups of people right like I think all of us have a calling and it's like
 This is something that you felt before your tug that you're trying to go out there and you're trying to make change
 I'm trying to make people's lives better, right? And that's why that's why we create businesses. That's why we do all the things we do
 But it's difficult because like when we first start at least for me when I first started to try to do this
 I didn't have a very good skill set
 I was just like you have to buy my stuff like what are you dumb like just buy my stuff and like that was kind of my my
 My level of skill sled in persuasion was that was just like like I promise yourself is great
 You just like just do it just listen to me
 I just trust me and guess what happened when I when I tried to it to to persuade people that way
 It didn't work very well, right?
 So I had to start learning a persuasion. How do you how do you get somebody to move?
 How do you get someone to care? How do you create empathy? How do you like all these different things right and
 It's taken me a man 15 plus years or more. You can't learn these things. I'm definitely not perfect at it
 but you know, I've I've had some success in my life because of it and I
 want to just I want to give some some tools for anybody for everybody who's listening
 because they're different they're different things that are happening and
 And I think that if if we really want change to happen in any area of our life
 We need to increase our skill set to become better and so a couple things that we'll talk about number one
 I'm going to quote the great Stacy and Paul Martino
 They are funnel hackers Stacy spoke of fun like a nine two years ago
 And if you know anything about them, they have a company called relationship development and they help
 Couples, but I just couples help anyone in in a relationship. It could be co-workers could be
 boss slash employee could be whatever right and
 I've been through a lot of different training for relationships and
 Marriage and you know all sorts of stuff and their stuff is by far the best I've seen so
 If you have a chance to study them do they've got a really cool podcast called the relationship transformers and they go deep into the stuff
 They've got a live events that I've been to they've got I mean, they're just they're they're awesome
 I'm hoping somebody they write a book but they haven't yet
 So keep on crossing our fingers
 But one of the concepts that they talk about that I think is so important for us to understand today in fact
 They they moved to Boise recently and last Sunday. We went on a walk with them and
 Kind of talk about this this the crazy stuff that's happening right now
 And she said say she said something really powerful
 She said the reason why they're struggling is they're all using demand relationship and so they had this whole
 concept called demand relationship, which is brilliant
 And again, you need to go through their events listen to podcasts to really understand it
 We talked before about doing a live event with them. Maybe we'll try to do something that soon
 We stream it here from from Boise's headquarters to see us can learn more about demand relationship
 But the concept is demand relationship is the thing that that us humans as a society have used over the last
 however many years have been here on this planet to get what we want, right?
 So demand relationship is basically like
 In fact, it's funny. You see it at school you see it at home
 You see it in almost every relationship
 But there's like there's a power player and there's like the the lesser person right and the power player demands that a person does the thing and
 you know for for generations that worked
 until the
 The lesser person I can't really call them. There's the power player
 Which is like the person is demanding the thing and then there's the other person and
 Demand relationship works until
 The other person has the ability to leave and it was interesting. I talked about why this is this is why
 You know kids a lot of times like the parents power player like forcing kids to do the thing as soon as the kids are 18
 It's like oh they leave and they just disappear and they go crazy because they've been under this demand relationship their whole life
 Right and the parents are like yeah, I'm forcing my kid to do good so that therefore they're gonna be good
 It's like that's not actually how it works
 Yeah, they may be good under your your rain under your thumb
 But the second they have a chance to leave they're gone and they talk about this a lot in
 In marriages as well, right like a lot of times in a marriage
 there's a demand player who's in charge everything and demands whatever is gonna happen and
 So that worked in marriages forever until the divorce laws became a thing and as soon as that people could divorce they could leave the
 demand relationships crumble and
 You think about this in business the same thing like if you're bossing a demanding a person is persons free to leave
 Crumbles, but that's the only skills that we have because that's what we've seen happen throughout time
 We've seen this happen in governments who see happened with our families and have their parents is happening in
 offices at school at T like everything
 They our whole brain has been wired with this thing called demand relationship
 It was crazy about Stacey Paul's work is like their whole job is to rewire our brains to not do demand relationship
 Which is hard especially when it's the pattern that we're all so familiar with
 The six things I've been watching this with all the controversy happening online and the people who are trying to create change instead of
 Going about it the way that actually causes truthful change which again
 Stacing Paul called this relationship development and they have a whole system stuff
 But instead that everybody's going to demand relationship because that's what they know
 So they understand it's like think is gonna work
 So coming in there demanding people to like to believe what they believe and to say what they say and like and they're trying to force people
 And right now they're getting they're getting some some traction right people are like scared and they're they're shifting and they're you know
 They're there's a power player and they're forcing their their hand and they're saying the thing that they want to say
 But it's not creating true
 actual change
 and then I was looking on Instagram and
 Neil Strauss by the way is awesome
 Some context Neil Strauss here. He's written a ton of books. He's like a ten time New York Times of a seller, but I thought about him
 He wrote this book called the game, which is like how to pick up
 They had to be a pickup artist or something
 Which is like kind of a famous marketing book because it teaches persuasion all these cool things like that
 Anyway, so I when we were first launching ClickFunnels
 I went and built funnels for a whole bunch of people because I wanted to you know
 Just make just don't cool funnels
 And so we flew out and did funnels for a lot of really cool people one people's you know Strauss
 I didn't really know that well only a new bad was was this book you'd written call you know the game
 But I know I had no much about him and we hung out for a for a night while we built a funnel for him and he would he would Jim is
 one of the neatest
 Like one of my favorite people I think I've ever met like just I mean he had an event the next day
 He said it's like four in the morning with us just talking and asking questions and like just a fascinating human like I really I really respect
 Neil anyway, I digress so he posted on Instagram day to day something that was just so powerful he said
 shaming someone into action creates acting
 inspiring someone into action creates change I
 was like
 Dang and then he's posting this in the middle of this chaos, right as he's seen it too
 It's like you can shame someone into
 Into action which creates acting where you can inspire some of the action creating which creates change
 Stacey Paul talk about this also in there in their in their trainings like
 It's a you know demand relationships like forcing someone to be to do what you want them to do
 But the opposite of that is
 transformation through inspiration and probably messing up some of the stuff you should buy there everything they put out there because they'll help you understand better but
 You know transformation through inspiration like like if you inspire people it makes them want to transform themselves, right?
 So here you know Strauss inspiring someone to action creates change. How do you inspire someone? I guess different and you know, I'm obviously
 religious and I believe in Christ and I think about Christ like it look like when he came and he ministered here on the
 So it's right. He wasn't the one out there like
 Forcing people to change he was out there teaching and inspiring and setting a perfect example for us to look at in the model
 And by looking at Christ example inspired us to want to change inspired us to want to become better
 Right, and that's if you read the the Bible if you read any of the religious books out there
 It's it's us learning about Christ life because like
 When we learned about his life in the spite of what happened him and everything that he kept caring and kept loving
 It's like oh my gosh like that inspiration of a human is what?
 Actually creates change and so I just wanted to to share this with everybody because I know
 You know today were fighting and arguing about one topic tomorrow with something else
 But each of you guys more importantly, I believe is in your own sphere of influence
 You've you got opportunities to help people and this could be in your marriage could be in your family
 It could be with your the you know the people that you serve inside of your communities whatever that thing is right and so
 the morning I understand like demand relationship by coming in like trying to force people to believe or to do
 It it again like Neil said shaving some of the action creates acting it's gonna create acting they may do it for a little bit
 But it's not you craze you really change them the way you really do is you inspire them
 That's that's true persuasion. That's what you actually people have changed not to get them to act
 And it's hard. It's more difficult demand relationships way easier
 It's way easier to yell someone to force someone to become a power player and push somebody into what you want to do
 It's harder to to change yourself to be able to learn how can I inspire these people to change?
 How can I how can I hear my message to my story in a way that makes them want to change then spires them again
 inspiring someone to action creates change as opposed to demand
 Shipping them and and becoming the power player making the most noise and forcing them to start acting but not actually create real change
 So anyway, I would just say for all of us who are trying to learn how to persuade and to lead
 Especially in these times where it's hard. It's difficult and man you every word you say you get destroyed online
 Pro positive or negative I've seen some of my best friends who just gotten beat up
 Man, I got beat up my friends man beat up first for for literally
 Saying anything I give it anyway. I won't get into it
 But just understanding that if you really want to create change it it comes down to you
 It doesn't come to you shaming somebody into acting it comes into you
 Inspiring someone into action and it's harder. It's gonna be harder for you
 It's gonna be way easier to be the man relationship and to yell and be angry and be mean
 It's gonna be way harder for you to learn how to inspire someone
 But that's the only way to create real change and so I want to encourage all of you to start learning those things
 How do you tell your story better? How do you have you become the person you need to be some people want to follow you?
 Right, what did Christ have to do?
 He led a perfect example and people followed him and even with that he was he was
 You know people destroyed him people. I mean he was he was murdered for it, right? And so it's not gonna be perfect
 But it's how you create true change that lasts. So I hope that helps
 All of us as we're navigating this this crazy time and it'll probably just keep on getting crazier
 At least all these elections are over. I don't care who wins. That's one thing to be done with election years are never
 fun, especially now we have this Internet thing where we're all connected and we have a chance to tell our opinions and I
 Will not have an opinion till the selections over
 anyway
 But I will try my best to be a good person to try inspire change and if I can do that
 Or someone out there that makes us a win. So and I appreciate you all thanks for listening. I hope you enjoyed this and I hope that
 It inspires you to go and look deeper start understanding this concept of the man relationship and figure out how to get yourself out of it
 Go study states and Paul go look in iTunes under relationship transform a podcast look for that
