 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast
 Today we're gonna talk about
 With probably the biggest thing that keeps people from having success in their business
 So let's keep theme song we come back. I'm gonna share the number one secret with you
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, so what is the secret to success well, there's a lot of secrets to success
 But there's one that's like really really interesting that I don't know why but over the last two weeks has come up
 Over and over and over and over and over again not so much in conversations
 But with people who are not successful and it's like this pattern that
 I keep seeing over and over and over again and
 And I keep thinking I need you to podcast up so about this
 There's somebody out there that must need to hear this because I keep on hearing it over and over and over again
 in my head and seeing the practical application of in people's lives, so it's actually really simple and
 When I say like oh wow that makes a lot of sense, but it's something that I think that a lot of times subconsciously we struggle with so
 This is the big secret if you want to be extremely successful in your life
 You have to celebrate the successes of the people around you
 That's it. That's the big aha. We can end the podcast right now
 Let me elaborate though for those who who who want to hear me pontificate on this for a few moments
 I'm such a nerd anyway
 so
 The reason why I bring up is like
 When someone has success and you celebrate you're like oh my gosh
 That's so cool good for you
 Then your mind is like like your subconscious mind starts looking at that and saying okay
 Wow like that person's success
 We're celebrating it like I want to celebrate and then starts trying to figure out pathways for you to have success
 When you see someone successful and you're like oh that person's so annoying
 Oh, I hate the fact that blah blah or oh and the airtime success happens
 You shut it down and you talk about why it's not good why the person is observant and why whatever whatever you'll fill in the blanks and whatever reason
 It is you're not so brain similar to success your brain instantly starts thinking your subconscious minds like oh my gosh
 Like I don't want to be successful cuz then I am stuck up all I'm rich. Oh, I'm a bad person
 Oh, I'm selfish. Oh, like whatever it is that you're inserting into somebody else's story is what your brain will insert as the
 natural side effect of success
 So what that means is when somebody around you has success you need to like
 Freak out and celebrate them no matter what you have you hate that person right?
 You know the person's like a bad person and you're like I hate that person
 I wish I wouldn't be six, you know actually you should probably should be like watching success and people you don't like but you know
 I mean he just
 Is is becoming super conscious of that like hey this person had success. I'm gonna celebrate that
 Congratulations so cool from so excited not having any any tinge of jealousy or
 Bitterness or being upset or any of those things because as soon as you don't think enter your mind
 If you don't get rid of them quickly then your minds are associating success with all the negative things
 You're dumping on even though it's not your own success and those things will keep you from being successful. It's interesting like
 Yeah, one was it and the first one I think I was I was ever aware of this was probably the very first time I went to Tony Robbins event and
 It wasn't it was like a dorky thing
 But he was talking about movies and he said something about like you know
 Hey, we're here saw this movie and you hear I calf the audience grown and I can't remember what the movie was
 but
 But he kind of stopped and he's like do you realize that that people's like there are people that risk
 Hundreds of millions of dollars to make this movie for you with with no guarantee of any
 Success right and they hired people and spent years writing the scripts and doing producing the things and doing all this stuff
 and it cost you ten dollars to go and be entertained for two and a half hours and
 You know and you come out like all that movie sucked
 You're like literally people spent hundreds of millions dollars to entertain you and cost you ten bucks
 And you're complaining about about about the fact you thought the movie sucked and he talked about you know
 If you look at Kings back in you know, you know hundred years ago or a thousand years ago, whatever
 You know and they had court jesters and they had people that would come and entertain them like like well
 We can get for ten dollars is better than than what all these people come on for you know
 You know for hundreds of millions of dollars and yet we come and complain and go that movie sucked
 Oh, it was boring. Oh, it didn't well
 But you know whatever the thing is and I'm really starting getting me to think like man
 If I you know if people are creating the stuff and then I'm like poo pooing it
 It's like if you know when I create stuff and I put my heart and my soul and all my my energy into it
 And then people come out like oh that course was boring. Oh, I didn't learn anything new. Oh like whatever the your insert the blank is
 I know it rubs off on you negatively and so ever since then like I try to celebrate movies
 She'd probably see me like when the Avengers come out or the new thing comes out or whatever like
 I'm always like freaking out excited and then people come back and the reviews are always like oh movies lame
 I'm like are you kidding me? It cost me ten bucks and for two and a half hours on the edge of my scene
 Yeah, I went part was weird or stupid
 But like people risk so much entertainment. I'm so grateful for that and like because I'm so grateful for it
 Like it shifts my mind. I'm creating courses to like I don't know
 it just it just shifts around where it's like I'm gonna produce the best thing possible I can and give it to my audience and
 And I don't know it just shifts the perspective in your mind
 So that's kind of a lot of share with yesterday is in all sorts of things like how you how you react to other people's
 Success or other people's art or other people's creation is how people probably respond back to yours
 But more importantly is how your subconscious mind is gonna start associating those things
 And so if you're not careful if you're not positive in all these other things your subconscious mind is gonna get started associating them with negative
 Feelings and it's getting harder and more difficult for you to go do it. Does that make sense?
 Anyway, hopefully that wasn't too like woo-woo on a weird level for you, but it's it's super true
 So what that means is when people around you have successes
 I highly encourage you guys to celebrate even if you don't feel like they deserve them even if you are annoyed by it
 Even if you don't like the person you've like whatever the the thing is if you want to be more successful
 You've got to celebrate their successes. Okay, and so
 That's my challenge for you today. All right, that's them at the office. I'm gonna go get some work done today
 I don't know about you guys, but summer
 Summer is so hard
 Members of kid looking forward to summer, but like I was telling my I was talking to Kled about this last night like it's
 It's it's crazy like
 If you if you think about a typical day, right like my day when the kids are in school like I wake up
 Whatever at 5 30 I I work out and go my stuff before to wake up and then I wake up
 And then I try to be like a present dad from 7 till 9 I take him to school drop mom
 I'm 9 till like 5 I'm like working my butt off
 Get all my stuff done and I try to be presents to get home from 5 till 9
 I'm there present with him playing and then from 9 till 10 or 11 my wife and I hang out until we pass out
 And that's the night right and it's like a brutal schedule to keep present all day long right
 And then it's like summer happens and the kids suddenly are like like I still have to wake up early because like the one
 I can work out early so I still wake up same time right and then you do your day
 But now the kids aren't in school
 So I don't know about you at least for me
 I feel guilt like I guess she's my kids more so then I like stay later in the morning and then I come home early and I try to like
 like you know like the other day I went and spent
 Three or four hours in the middle of the day to go hang out with them to go do some fun stuff right so like I'm doing all those things kind of
 Kind of throughout
 But I still think it's the amount of work done right and then we get home at night
 And then it's like I got the present and then and nine o'clock the kids want to go to bed now
 It's like it's summertime I don't have to go to bed like what like it's like you need to go to bed
 I don't and so they don't go to bed to like midnight
 And so like you have to go to stay until midnight to get those punks to actually go to bed
 And then it's like then midnight
 You finally go to bed or one o'clock or whenever you can find him to bed
 And then it's like then you want to spend like five minutes your wife
 It's like from one to one oh five you hang out and you all just pass out and you're tired and then you know the clock
 The alarm car goes off same time next morning
 So you have to jam like three times as much a day into every single day
 So I'll tell you what we're one month down the summer
 And I cannot wait for the next two months to be done swing it back to normal schedule because like my body is shutting down
 I am so tired
 Anyway, I digress I'm gonna go work
