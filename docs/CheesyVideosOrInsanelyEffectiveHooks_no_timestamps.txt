 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast today. We're gonna talk about
 Cheesy videos thrown out hooks and a whole bunch of other fun stuff
 So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, all right everybody. I hope you guys are doing great today. Oh, oh man
 I want to tell you about the fun things I've been doing in my life. So every
 Well, let me step back. Okay, so
 Those who follow the clickfuddles journey for a long time
 You know that we're always trying to figure out different ways to get people to join clickfuddles and buy my products and all the things right
 and it's funny because
 I get people all the time to ask like why are you still making so many ads and creating products and
 writing books and all these kind of things and for me
 It's a couple reasons one is like I love what I do. So there's there's the most important thing, right?
 number two is I
 Feel like the things we're doing help us grab different segments of the market and bring people into our world
 Which is exciting number three if you've read the book crossing the chasm or the spot now where we have we have I
 Think penetrated the early adopters and the innovators in our world
 And now we're moving across the chasm to try to get the rest of the world to become funnel hackers and to join this movement
 That we're so excited and so proud of and so those are some of the things that are happening
 And so number four I think I'm number four. I got a lot of who knows we're number one number four is
 Is I feel like I'm trying to create examples for you guys to model right?
 So there's a lot of the reasons I do that's one of them. So
 one one of the things we did a few years ago was we tried
 We hired the Harmon brothers you guys know they did squatty potty and a fiber fix is one of the most amazing, you know
 viral videos of all time, so they've done I think four
 four or five and they did a bunch of videos for us that have gone viral that are really good that were really really fun and
 Last year actually was watching
 Caitlin Poland those who know Caitlin aka the lady boss
 You know she kind of grew up in our world doing a lot of our stuff and it was interesting because about a year ago
 So they she started doing these videos and they're kind of like viral videos instead like you're typically a the Harmon brothers style video
 They hire actors and actors and everything instead
 Caitlin was the actress in each of the videos and they were scripted out they're funny and like and I watched these videos
 which was rolling out and they were so cool and I was like so excited by it and
 I messaged them a couple months later just to see how they were going and I can't remember the numbers
 The number I remember my head which could be completely wrong was like six X
 He's like it's grown our company six X these new videos
 And I got excited I was like I want to do that like make funny videos
 But I'm the person and as opposed to hiring actors and stuff, you know and so
 But I didn't have the time or the bandwidth, you know my team with million things happening and so on
 It's kind of cool. There's another company that's
 competitors to Harmon brothers, but
 They're their business models will different instead of doing one highly produced video that costs a million dollars
 They do a whole bunch of smaller videos, right and and so
 The guy that owns it his name's Travis Chambers
 He lives here in Boise and so I messaged him because I was like if I could do these videos and I believe Boise that'd be amazing and
 so we ended work out of deal and
 basically
 We're doing 12 videos with them where each month we launched a new video and they're kind of fun
 So they do all the scripting I told them I'm like I don't want to think I don't want to I just want to show up film stuff
 Go home and then a month later the videos launch on I'm not involved in the process of all right
 And so it's been kind of fun because their team goes and they do the writing they do all the things and I show up and I film
 And so some of you has a probably seen some of the videos
 The first one is me with a coke and a Mentos bottle and a kitchen we had an Airbnb we had rented
 Like show you you know you put a Mentos and coke and it explodes and try to catch that
 You know kind of catch all the coke in a bottle and first time didn't work
 So I put a funnel and it works and catch away more right and so it's like this video and it's me acting and it's I know
 I've seen you guys watching and they've seen him like this is cringe worthy Russell. You should not be acting
 I'm like I know I'm not an actor, but that was the first we did next we did it was like this lemonade stand scene
 Which was really funny we blew things up
 You know and it's it's hard me I go back and I watch these I'm like oh so painful for me to watch myself act
 It's like so embarrassing
 They mean to like a mission an impossible theme where they strapped me to a harness
 I was like dropped from the ceiling then we did a like a first-person shooter one which was really fun
 And yesterday we filmed one that was like an angel in the devil
 I was the angel as the devil like on a dude's shoulder trying to convince him to use click funnels and then today we're filming one
 For five to lead challenge with lead magnets and a bunch of other stuff and anyway, it's just fun
 So every month actually every other month we go and spend two days when we knock out two videos and then we're doing 12
 them so one a month for or you know basically toy out we're launching one a month
 So we're putting these things out there and it's funny cuz I guarantee some some people especially
 I'm sure my competitors like Russell you're such a dork. Why are you doing this so embarrassing like why are you putting yourself out there?
 And it's there I'm doing it for a couple reasons okay and most of them are the same reasons I talked about earlier right like I'm
 I'm legitimately proud of what we do right and then and my job
 If you've read the traffic seekers book is to create hooks to grab people's attention
 So I can tell my story so then we can make them an offer right and so all these things are just different hooks
 Like me dropping from the ceiling to get people the OFA challenge is a hook right me being an angel in a devil
 And acting horribly because I'm not a good actor is a hook to get somebody to stop the scroll
 So I can tell them my stories I can bring them into our world right and so all these things are that way
 And so Tony is this because I know some of you guys aren't making ads because you're embarrassed like oh look stupid
 I'm up funny. I'm not blah blah blah you know whatever the insert excuse here some of you guys are doing it because
 You don't know how to act or you don't know we don't feel comfortable on camera
 You think I feel comfortable on camera doing these things no I don't not even a little bit
 It's so awkward for me. They're making me do these voices. We're so embarrassing and like I watched the video afterwards
 It's all super crazy, but then it's like it goes it launches and oh my gosh
 It grabs people's attention stops the scroll and and it's bringing new blood into my world
 And so that's why I do it because it's it's the way I reach more people right it's new hooks to throw out there
 It's new creative opening out there all the time the more creative you put out the more people you can grab more attention you can get
 And so
 That's one of the big reasons right number two is like I'm trying to model for you guys like what's working
 Right you look at Kalen's videos if you haven't like go go follow her their fan page and watch your videos
 Like they're killing it with it right and she's a better actress than me by far her videos
 She's I mean go on now. She's just great at what she does
 I'm like the dorky version try to be cool like her and I'm not as cool as her
 But they still work right and so it's like modeling like why is also doing this like this is goofy like instead of me like
 Why is he making these these goofy videos?
 It's like huh maybe there's something behind these maybe I should try to make something like that
 How can I have some fun with it right?
 I remember when we first started thinking about how do we throw more hooks out there Dean Grazios who was when I was
 Following a time and he was putting out so many videos he was doing magic trick videos who's doing him and his
 Daughter's soccer game videos. He was doing thing after thing after thing and I was like I need to put out more hooks
 I don't even know what to do and and it was hard for me right and so this is like by hiring somebody and putting it in a
 Process it's something where it's forcing me to put out these hooks more and more often right and
 so
 anyways, hopefully
 Again, I know a lot of you guys
 You know, you go and you buy the book you buy the course and you can be talking about throwing out all these hooks, right?
 Like yes, that's a big part of it
 Okay, but that's that's not the the full point of it, right?
 The full point isn't for me to tell you about getting hooks is for me to actually do it so you can see me and they
 Oh, that's what Russell's talking about. He actually practices what he preaches unlike most of the gurus who just talk about something
 Russell's actually doing this let's model what he's actually doing anyway, so
 I'm sure if you've seen the videos, that's what they are if he happens to me yet
 I'm sure you will see them and they will keep popping up and you're like man that Russell Brunson
 He's the hardest working man in this industry
 He cares more about this craft than anybody because he's willing to embarrass himself and put out all these hooks
 And it's true because I love what I do. I love my message
 I love the people who are serving and so I'm willing to be uncomfortable and be goofy to get their attention
 It's interesting. I remember hearing the camera who it was, but this is probably a decade ago or something else studying
 I wasn't studying acting but I was like studying actors who were successful and I remember reading quote from somebody saying like if you
 Realized how to be good actor. It's like you have to go over the top and feel like you do things make you feel so uncomfortable
 Then on camera seem normal and I remember hearing that I was like oh weird and remember when I the very first time I was trying to get PR
 Like you I tried to do it in for Marshall. That was the first time I tried to do it in for Marshall
 I remember my host came on, you know, and he was interviewing me on the infomercial and after like first take or so he stopped
 He's like alright. This is Dylan's like if you talk normal
 He's like you sound like you're dead on TV
 He's like you have to be up like this and super excited and then you sound normal on TV
 And so he said that's like the like that's the energy to have his way up here to go to stay on normal
 And so like he kept training me and forcing me to do these things that stretch that made me feel uncomfortable
 It's like take it to the level you know level 10 little 12
 15 whatever it is and then it's like now you seem normal and sure enough like we watched the infomercial back was like oh
 I actually doesn't sound goofy. It sounds normal
 Whereas if I sound normal it sounds like I'm dead and that was just kind of a big aha
 It's something when I when I did media training before I tried to my PR the very first time
 It's like like you got to grab some of the tension if you talk like you normally do nobody's gonna pay attention
 You're not gonna get people's attention, right?
 And that was that was 18 years ago 15 years ago whenever it was nowadays
 Like it's way harder, right? How many ads you swipe through on Facebook or Instagram every single day, right?
 How many times has somebody heard about doc home secrets or expert secrets or click funnels or one fun way challenge?
 And they ignored it until they saw me dropping from the ceiling like
 Ethan Hunt in Mission possible right or until they saw shoulder angel Russell fighting a shoulder devil Russell and also like wait
 What and they watch it and they're like, okay?
 I gotta try this thing out like what's the hook that's gonna finally get the person's attention?
 You don't know until you go out there and do it and do it and do it so anyway, that's why that's the purpose
 I hope that it helps
 Like I said I'm gonna go cleaned up because in one hour they pick me up for my next video
 This one's gonna be goofy - that's goofy's yesterday's yesterday's I'm actually really excited for shoulder angel shoulder day at double one
 but um today's is a one for a five-wheel-e challenge like I said every single month we're picking a new video to do and
 Try new hooks some hooks will work some won't be done until you throw them out there
 So that said you guys get back to work go make some more hooks make some more videos throw it out there
