 Hey everyone, this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast yesterday
 I gave you guys behind the scenes of day number one of the 10x growth con convention event what happened how we did on sales
 And hopefully enjoy kind of hearing a little behind the scenes of it now
 Take us day number two because I had a chance to speak two days at this event
 It's something to walk you guys been seeing what happened there
 Later on my second presentation didn't share a bunch of cool stuff with you as well
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Alright, so I woke up day number two and
 Once again, I was nervous and so I woke up and I got my slides I started working on my slides and getting fixed this new presentation
 I never done before and I'm stressing out thinking how in the world am I gonna do this presentation?
 There's an echo nobody can hear me and I did the best I got everything ready and then I headed over to the venue
 We got the venue I saw Dave Woodward and Dave had been helping a ton Dave is just amazing
 amazing human when the hardest workers you'll ever meet and just
 Someone who's amazing at getting stuff done and so grant a seamless poll on day and like what should you do?
 Well, how do we fix this and so they went and got pipe and drape and wrapped the whole upper concourse and then then
 Hoping to block sound they opened up the on the top of the the dome
 That's our grand parachute and they closed it and it was super humid and hot inside
 Like fact I was on stage just pouring sweat my face was so humid where they captured all humidity
 So they broke it back open just like I don't know 10% open so that this and the echo could could get out
 They changed the microphones and they did it, you know
 They removed some microphones a bunch of things to try to clean up the sound and it was better still was not amazing
 But it was better and so I got there and one thing that says said Russell
 You can't speak as fast as you do if you do when you speak this fast everything bounces off the walls
 So if you can do this presentation you have to speak in sound bites
 You say something it hits the wall comes back to the next thing it hits something comes back and everything's ever spoken in sound bites
 I was like oh crap like I have a big like a Twitter slide presentation. I can't do that 90 minutes
 With without someone in and deleted like by 50 slides to I just want my favorite parts
 Somebody I'm gonna do this presentation
 And I want you guys to see it because like I literally do a presentation then in the presentation
 I show you what I did to you in the presentation. It's so cool
 But I had to delete all that because it just wasn't gonna I couldn't get it all fitted in there
 So I deleted a whole bunch of stuff
 And then one of the big ideas I had for this presentation was I was going to bring some other speakers on stage people who've gone through
 our training and
 And let them come on stage and just tell their stories which I was really excited for so my second presentation is called 10x
 Secrets mastery and then it was how
 Like how they could learn how to speak from stage and I was really excited for this because you know at the last
 Next I had 3.2 million this one we just done 2 million day 4 I was gonna show him like look
 How'd you like learn how to make a million dollars or too many?
 You know how to make how to sell to the masses like this like most of the people in the room were salesman
 I'm like selling one on one is one thing was selling one on many
 It's completely different skills that you have to learn in and master and I want to show you guys how to do this
 And so we did okay this presentation so
 So what happened this is really cool. So I think all of us were kind of feeling a little bummed out and and
 You know sad from the day before she hadn't hit our goals and so we kind of looked our wounds and
 And all people who were just gonna bring on stage
 I had them meet me in the green room to kind of go over the presentations
 I showed them what was gonna happen and we could talk about it
 So I brought him in and I showed him my presentation now a couple of highlights of the presentation
 I found footage of the very first time I ever spoke from stage and
 It was so bad. So I showed him that those clips and then I started walking through
 My presentation in the presentation I take two big jobs at Gary Vaynerchuk
 Which is really fun because Gary called me out on podcast recently and so I thought you know as long as I have the mic
 I'm standing in front of 35,000 people. I should definitely make fun of Gary Vaynerchuk and so I did it was amazing
 It was that it was cool because I talked about there's two ways to become a speaker
 Number one is become famous and get paid to speak and I show how
 People like Tony Robbins short-sneighor Oprah Bill Clinton Ellen Richard Branson Cuban
 How much they charge for Keaton which is like 200,000 ish or something?
 I was like he had all this up it's 1.4 million you get all those guys to be your public speakers
 I was like at 10x last year, you know
 I sold 3.2 million my take-home was 1.6 million
 So it's like you could you know either become famous and make Twitter grand or learn how to sell for stage and make way more
 And then I I show this picture me and Gary Vaynerchuk sitting there
 I said look there's two paths and Gary chose different one than me Gary wants to become famous Gary charges $10,000 for speech
 And then I show the slide where I was like, you know, I made 3.2 million dollars 90 minutes
 I went home to believe my kids my family and said do you know me keynotes Gary'd have to give to be able to
 To make what I did 90 minutes. I see he had to give 22. I said that's one a week. That's 22 weeks
 I said, you know and I have show picture famous looking super tired
 I said look if you you can go and you can hustle and be tired
 If you want to become famous or you can just learn how to sell and make the same out in one
 You know one presentation and that was jab number one. I made another jab later on, but it was fun
 Yeah, so for those who love Gary, sorry, but he talked trash about me
 So I got my I got the last word which was amazing and people were laughing super hard, which was great
 Anyway, then I went down I showed them where they're gonna come in so some of the people that were coming in to do parts of the
 Presentation the first one was Garrett J White
 He came in he was gonna talk about his results taking this framework
 then we had
 Brad Giv and his partner Ryan Lee who they've done they basically used to sell
 Financial services across the kitchen table
 And they took this methodology of selling to the masses and I have a webinar picture
 They had 1200 people on a webinar last week now and they actually just passed to comical back
 So they over ten million dollars time when their funnels were just amazing that I Jamie Cross who's using the same presentation to sell soap and
 And her oils and things like that and I'd stay see Paul Martino Stacy came up and talked about how they're using us to save marriages
 Then I had let's see who the other people scroll through here make sure for anybody
 Then we had
 Natalie Haughtson came up and shot at us with the fat event in her experience
 She went to fat event and former Slater made it over a million dollars selling her
 her $37 ebook, which was amazing and then I had Annie Grace talk now she
 Uses to help people to quit drinking and then she uses to make a bunch of money
 Her event and then I had myron golden who's gonna come up and do his magic because he is
 Man with the most amazing humans. I have ever had a chance to meet in this world and myron
 We're gonna bring him up and have him tell some of his stories and do what myron does best
 Which is get the audience to buy and so we're all excited and you know
 I was still kind of nervous because how bad it's been the day before and it was funny because I
 Kind of walked them off through the presentation from at work
 They were just excited and sure asked what's the goal how I'm gonna sell and you know
 I was like if we get a hundred I'll be happy and myron's like hundred we can do a thousand and everyone's kind of you know all over the place and
 and
 And it was pretty cool. And then
 As we recorded this it was funny cuz Dan
 Usher who runs
 The click funnel studio up in Toronto and he's amazing videographer he was
 He wanted to capture this thing and having Garrett to kind of come and pretend like he was the coach
 It was supposed to be this like this joke thing and so Garrett they mic'd him up
 And then he came over starting this joke evening for probably a minute
 And then he just like he's like screw it. You know he said screw it
 You know Garrett he swears instead of that
 But and then he just like switched over into this like
 Man, I feel like he was like a coach in a locker room like coaching all of us through
 The the callings we had and how this was a platform had to show his callings and it was like
 I don't know five or six minutes long and man by the time it was done
 Around all the speakers and they were all crying. I feel bad cuz Annie was back there and her makeup was all smeared and
 I like to Garrett as he's telling this to me directly to me
 He's got tears trimmed on his face and I'm sitting I start crying and like all of us are sitting here in this room
 Just bawling our eyes out crying his carrots talking about our missions and how they all tie together and and
 Anyway, what's cool is because we had put on the mic for this thing that we were trying to capture
 We captured this whole amazing speech that was not planned
 And brought me and so many people in my team to tears and so I actually wanted to share it with you
 I got the recording of it
 I want to plug it in right here so you can hear what Garrett said because I think it meant a lot to me
 And I locked those who are here and hopefully it gives you guys
 kind of a glimpse of
 Your business and my role in your businesses, right?
 like
 You know I was
 Over the last couple years I've had times are like what am I doing this for like what's the purpose like?
 I'm hoping we'll grow businesses. Why does that matter in the whole grand scheme of things and
 it's interesting because
 One of my one of my mentors and friends names Tara Williams
 Tara told me
 She said you have to look at your your mission check. I really think it's it's a couplefold one is like there's there's people
 that
 Have so much financial strain that they can't do anything else
 I figure figure out how to get a financial strain and you come in and say you give people the tools
 They need to free themselves from the captivity of debt or money
 and they free themselves that then they can look outward and start serving and helping other people and
 When she said I was like oh my gosh
 Maybe that is my thing because like who cares if you guys make million bucks or 10 million bucks
 It doesn't matter right what matters is that if I can get the stress and the pressure of you have to make money off your back
 Then you can start looking outward and start serving other people right and that's why you know our community
 I like all these people all people around states are all people who were who who had a vision they had a message
 They couldn't get it out and so they came somehow they they bumped into to us what we're doing and we were able to help
 facilitate to get them into a spot where they could take the pressures of
 Money off their backs they could focus on serving other people and everyone who was speaking there have now served
 Thousands and tens of thousands of people you know Stacy and Paul Martino have saved over 10,000 marriages
 Excuse me any grace has helped
 Thousands of people beat the chains of alcohol addiction on and on and on and so I think that's why I was so emotional for
 So I'm gonna actually plug in that clip right here so you can hear the speech that Garrett gave in the locker room
 Do you know why I'm here?
 I'm here because I believe in you
 Truly I
 Was already gone for six days. This is the longest I've been gone for my family in five years
 I'm here because of you
 You're called to do what you do. I
 Was not called to do what you do without you. I can't do what I was called to do
 Like I'm not here for promotion. That's great. It'll be great for me. I'm here because I'm in your
 Military force. I'm on your team. I'm in your unit. You're the general
 I run a unit my men listen to what I say in the way. I'm called. I follow you because you're called
 Like we say here inside I listen to your story like every single one of us have the same thing
 I know I know the backstory. I know what the story is. Yeah, the example is self-soap
 But at the end of the day you're sending a message to women
 Like this is serious for me
 When I shared with you earlier the piece they're not getting today and they haven't gotten so far
 They haven't gotten the reason why I follow you
 It's just thing man
 This thing. It's bigger than you and it's bigger than me
 Like dude, I love you. I respect the head of you
 Today I'll go to war with you
 But for something that you have seen long before I could see it
 It's not flowery speech for me to talk about how click funnels did something for me
 Hey, what can I get from this without click funnels? There is no movement of warrior without the frames
 There is no conversion to men to learn to live and marriages and families die in my world
 People follow you because of who you are and what comes through you
 The software is the weapon the frame is the game, but you're the reason
 And I love the reluctant hero. I do I love it
 But there's a piece in you too. That's ready to click
 This is the piece that you got an army
 Just waiting for that little click of fire and it's game
 over
 There's no one that will stand on this stage that can harness the power including me
 That you have access to right now because you built an army
 and you weaponize them and
 You believe in God and I believe in God
 And I know that all of us here are doing something bigger than we actually understand
 and so out there was a circus yesterday and
 It happened on purpose and it set up. What's about to happen?
 From the beginning when you walk on to the begin when Marlon you finish it up
 Every single one of us have an important role to play which is get into the state
 That's required that when you start speaking the thing that comes through him comes through you
 So that this is seen not as a Russell show or a gear show or any of us
 It is not even a click funnel show it is a movement of people been called to lead movements all centralized on one thing
 Which is waking people up?
 I see you man. I've seen you for a long time
 And I know you see me because in that we see the same thing
 And when I get to spend time with you guys that I haven't got to spend time with I see the same thing in you guys
 So all the frames to decide the frames everybody knows them
 35,000 people doesn't matter that means that on the other side of the game we cannot see
 There are numbers we cannot contemplate
 They're currently standing waiting for you simply to get out of the way and speak and
 They're sitting in the ears of everyone in their seats whispering
 This is the time
 So I'm here because I follow you
 My wife's life has changed because of you
 It sounds funny that she was reading your book, but you were the only one that could have got into it
 So I'm honored to be here
 honored to support you and your calling and
 I'm honored to meet all of you and be here with you and some of you I know better than others
 And this was supposed to be a locker room speech of a different kind and be funny and the truth is I don't really know how to
 Do that on cue?
 So anything funny ever say it's not on purpose. It just happens
 But this right here. This is why I'm here and I needed what you had to be able to take this that I feel and
 Take it to literally hundreds of thousands and soon millions
 Thank you
 All right, I don't know about you, but again in the room it had all of us crying and I'm just so grateful for Garrett
 Because it gave us it kind of regrouped us and gave us motivation like okay. Let's go out there
 We're gonna change we're gonna change all these people's lives and so we got done
 Then I had having slides off to Jake on my team and Jake ran it to their audio video guy
 And I was like okay, I can't touch the slides again here we go and so that's what happened all right
 So now fast forward three or four hours later
 I was supposed to be the last speaker before the end of the day and the very random day they have had a
 Some DJ or some Dougie fresh
 I don't know something like that I just be doing some rap thing after me
 But everything ran late so everything's like an hour and a half beyond were supposed to be but they're like
 You know what last things like this rapper so just do your thing and this is how we're making the big money
 If you think about this like again from a choreographing of the event
 You know this could have and should have been where
 This event made us money like it
 It should have been the big the big payday and everything should have been coordinated to that
 You know, but
 Unfortunately
 Things happened and so I got back prepared to do my my thing and a couple things happen number one
 It's right for a onstage. It just makes no logical sense and it's like the it's like the the backwards
 choreography but grab ones on stage and he told everyone said hey everyone we're doing two for one t-shirts right now
 But yeah, I get him in the next hour otherwise they're gone
 They're gone and literally like 30% of the entire audience stands up and runs out
 Right before like right when he's announcing me and runs out to go and like
 Go buy t-shirts make a $10 offer
 It's like you're blocking a $25,000 offer with a $10 offer
 So everyone's running out of the stadium to buy t-shirts
 There were two is like every speaker has been announced from behind the stage where the thing lifts up and you walk out
 and it's just big thing, right and
 So I'm back behind stage about to be announced that way and then grant messages his guy and says
 I don't want Russell to be brought out from underneath the the screen again
 How come out from the side of the curtain?
 I was like dude you're supposed to be positioning me to be doing the big sale and then you
 Diminished my my
 Positioning by having me come up from the side instead of under the like it's just
 Insane that he would do that and take anyway, whatever
 So I lost the positioning which hurts when you do $25,000 offer and then every you know a
 Fourth or third of the audience was running out of the stadium to go buy $10 t-shirts and then I was announced and I came out
 So that was anyway interesting choreography. I get out there
 I start speaking and then an alarm goes off literally
 There's an alarm someone like set the alarm if you're right first by 10 minutes my speech there's an alarm blaring through the hallway
 So this whole thing which is crazy and then one section of the stadium
 They decided to start doing the wave so everyone's up there doing the wave and I hear them yelling and shouting and I hear the alarm going off
 And I'm up there. I'm like what in the world is happening. This is like chaos. I know what to do
 It's crazy
 But I step on stage
 I saw my presentation and I started slow and I say a line boom deliver a line
 We've been bounced back the next line deliver it. We've heard about spec deliver it and like I could feel it like oh
 Like there's something about this presentation that was different. It was magical. It was like I just it was so good
 So we're delivering this the thing and then I bring my guests on stage
 I have Garrett white come and do his thing and then I have each person come and share their part and just beautifully orchestrated
 everyone's success stories and testimonials like we've been perfectly and it was like
 Like the perfect thing my ring comes on stage. She does his clothes. He's doing his thing and it's just it was it was magical
 in fact my earned leaned over to me at one point and he said
 Well one of the I think I think it was Natalie or maybe it was
 Or and he was giving their testimonial and he's just like he's like look at the audience
 I looked and like everyone's so engaged is like he's like the worst case scenario you get a thousand people and I was like
 Oh my gosh, that's 25 million dollars right?
 I'm freaking out and so we go through the thing and we finished the thing and we're going through the stack in the closing
 We had one more closed left and
 Grants to my guess was like the DJ's be up right now and he goes today like you have your else left stage
 Day comes right over and gives me this look like you have to end this now
 I'm like liquid one more like the most important close the entire thing we had left was myron's
 Like the best one and I just go to my arm
 I cut it off here to stop and so we didn't get to the last close
 Which is the most important close of the entire freaking thing so we missed that one
 I do last part called action and I drive everyone to decay everyone on the floor and people to pay like ten thousand
 dollars to be here I said there's a cell table right here on the floor go over here $25,000
 There's sales table over here and we got a table
 People start jumping up and running and upstairs till ever start running and like it was so perfectly executed ends
 The plot stage and I'm like film on top of the world like oh my gosh that the presentation was perfect the delivery is perfect
 People were running to the sides like everything was amazing
 I go back to the green room and kind of hanging out and relaxing
 Oh, and then all the people came on stage
 They were over at the sales tables like to go close sales and I told them it's like all the people
 He met up stage say are over at the tables come over and talk to them
 They're gonna tell you their stories if you have any questions how this work for you and
 So anyway, that's what happens people go to things
 I go back to the green room and we're kind of relaxing like waiting for the numbers waiting for numbers and
 Probably chemistry get white comes in he's like dude you got screwed like what do you mean?
 He's like they blocked off the sales tables
 He's like I was by the sales table and all these people trying to get to me and they completely blocked it off
 They wouldn't let us come back. He's I was trying closed
 I couldn't even talk to single person and I'm like what and the illness came in there
 Yeah, we got kicked out and then Dave comes in later and days like yeah
 The fire marshal closed off one of the sales tables because there's too many people supposedly on the floor
 So the fire marsh closed off one no
 I'll be the right table fire marshal block them and then the DJ who was who was prepared for the thing
 He bought his team blocked off the other sales table
 So both sales tables on the floor for with all the
 Like 3,000 people have paid 10 grand a piece to sit down there the best buyers in the room the two sales tables where people
 Just to get money completely blocked block the two sales tables. There's no way for people to give the money
 It was it was insane
 So I like what the world then finally when I think I ends up about to leave Dave comes
 I'm like how do we do how do we do like I'm saying I'm thinking like if we bombed we would end a hundred right if
 Based on the presentation and the feeling of the audience and people were running it like everything I was like worst case scenario
 We did a hundred which is 2.5 million which is you now will be whatever almost five
 I'm like that's this one halfway to where our goal was
 Dave comes at me and he's just pissed like so mad
 He's like I don't want to tell you but I'll tell you and I'm like what he's like 14 like 14
 He's a yep, they blocked both sales tables only 14 people who randomly found us in other spots
 I'm like are you kidding me?
 like
 There's no way is like yep and now I keep this out because there's a D
 You know there's a rapper is gonna wrap who will make them zero dollars this event and it's just like oh my gosh
 And so that's kind of how that would end it which was just like so frustrating if like we'd executed our site everything perfectly
 So that night we took our team all 40 of them who were killing themselves
 We were ended a yacht and we went on a three-hour yacht thing at night dinner with them and let them all dance and have fun
 It was a good time and then the next morning woke up and
 All of the our team went back and they started closing deals and in our team closed another they got 13 more people who they found the hallways
 To sign up so we end up with
 What's that 27 or so?
 I think I think we have six hundred seventy five thousand dollars and sales from the 10 X
 It's all said and done from the 8th and then it was 2.7 million we ended
 Which again is not bad. It's great, but it's just tough when you're expecting 10 to make you know about three
 Anyway, so that was kind of how it all went and then that next that day
 We just kind of wrap out the rest of the vacation because it was crazy
 All of our affiliates from the 10 X launch as well as the people who spoke on stage
 We put them on we ran these two yachts and send them to the hammers
 So they went out that morning and and on this this mastermind yachts that are master mining while they were on the yacht and then
 My wife and I had to go shopping for some lacking live clothes
 So we shopped and we dropped and then we jumped in a private in our sea plane
 The private plane is the sea plane though
 So it's like sitting in the water it takes off in the water and flies you over to the Bahamas
 Then we landed the Bahamas and then we hung out all night that night master mining with all those people
 Which was really cool like just amazing to bash reminded everybody which is awesome next morning woke up and then jump back on the
 the yachts and went back to to Miami
 And that's a whole other story in and of itself we had
 They smuggled somebody on to our yacht who we got close jumped off and swam off
 They wouldn't like let us a couple of them with their flights because they wouldn't let us off because of passport issues
 It was it was just nuts
 but somehow eventually at the airport but often I flew home and
 And the whole trip ended and so that was the 10 X experience
 It's kind of funny as we were talking about everything that could have gone wrong literally went wrong on this trip
 But same time like we had such an amazing experience like grandis team like I love those guys
 They work so hard, you know
 So many things are outside their control the echoing the different things had to get 35,000 people into a stadium like
 So things like that and they did an amazing job with the event
 I mean think the smashing success for everybody and always frustrated with some of the choreography of the event
 You know that's not their strong suit and it's something that you know
 maybe next time we'll work them a little closer on but
 You know anyone that can put 35,000 people in the room is is amazing like I don't even know how it's possible
 but somehow they did it and
 It was amazing the B roll the pitchers like
 I'm sure you will see for next year and every ad of mine
 You'll see pictures of the videos and all the the amazingness because we got captured some cool stuff
 So worst case scenario we got the the B roll and it was it was really a great experience. So
 thankful for for grant for Jared for allowing us to come and for taking that and be part of it and
 Thank you for everyone who's there and even though a lot of you guys couldn't hear me
 I hope that you heard my message and the love that we have for all of you guys
 We honestly want nothing more in this life than to change your lives
 That's why we're here and why we were doing this whole craziness
 Because I tell you what I can made $2.7 million sitting at home not doing anything
 But we wanted to come and have a chance to share our message click funnels with
 With you and with everybody who was there and
 also because
 It's been interesting, you know, this whole internet marketing that all of us are are doing is not mainstream yet, right?
 It's funny because I feel like
 I got started doing this 15 years ago. It was like it was like this this weird like thing and people thought we were weird and and
 You know one of the things I've been trying to do over the last four or five years is really make this a mainstream thing
 Make funnels a mainstream thing. I want it someday where people don't talk about
 websites anymore they talk about funnels and I'm doing my best
 I think this is such a huge platform for us to be able to share that with so many people and and
 You know, I feel like for all of you guys remember businesses
 You're in you know, I'm trying to lead the way by making what I do mainstream and hopefully you guys are doing the same thing with your businesses as well
 So that said I'm gonna wrap this up. My voice is almost gone. Let me get home play with my kids
 Thank you so much for listening to everybody and fun hacking live is now a week and a half away
 I cannot wait to see a bunch of you guys there
 I have five or six presentations. I'm doing now to get ready for fun. I can live. It's gonna be amazing and
 I feel like fun like lives are family
 I'm so excited to go that event and just fill it home with my people and people get me and get us and excited to
 to share that with all of you and
 Without said, I appreciate you all and I'll talk to you as August soon. Bye everybody
