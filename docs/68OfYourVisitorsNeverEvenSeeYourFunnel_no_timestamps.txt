 What's up everybody, it's Russell Brunson and welcome to the last of the
 Secrets I want to share with you from the affiliate mastermind. This one has to do
 with page load times. So the big question is this, how are entrepreneurs like us
 who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own
 pockets? How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our
 services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain
 profitable? That was the question and this podcast will give you the answers.
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing Secrets.
 Okay, so I hope you have enjoyed some of the recaps we've here to share this week.
 There's one more cool thing I want to share with you. I'm not going to actually
 do the video clip of it but I do want to explain the concept because I think
 it's pretty, I think it's valid and I think it's interesting and so I'm going
 to be testing and it's worth it for all of you as well. So this is actually from
 Trevor Chapman and Trevor is one of my historical members who was there and
 it's interesting. He was talking about, he was doing all sorts of stuff with his
 funnels trying to figure things out and he started putting Google Analytics on
 stuff to do a deeper everything and as he was looking at analytics he was trying
 to figure it out and couldn't find someone so he's like I got to dig deep
 in this entire figure some stuff out and a couple of things he found that were
 interesting that again I think it's worth listening to. So number one, he said
 that basically 68% of visitors were, I don't know if it was his page or this is
 the industry staff from Google Analytics but 68% people leave the page before
 finished loading. So see your ad there, oh they click on it come over to the page,
 page starts loading and 68% of them leave before the page finishes loading.
 Which is interesting and so he started going back in and start saying okay my
 page is loading too slow. What do I need to do? I need like increase my page
 loads speed because I get more, you know if I'm losing 68% of people before
 page loads like that's more, you know a two-thirds of my traffic or whatever
 the fractions on that never used to my ad and so he started doing stuff to
 lower the lower things like lowering the image size, is lowering page size and
 page structure, a bunch of stuff like that and increasing how fast the page
 loaded and he got his from whatever, I can't remember how much he decreased the
 low time but from like 25, 30 seconds down to 10 seconds down to 5 seconds and
 he did that, he did like 2 to 3 x his income not by changing the page or the
 ad or anything just by reducing like increasing the page load time which was
 like super fascinating fact and he kind of mocked, he kind of teased me because
 the clickphones.com homepage right now, I don't think I'd rather myself
 images but takes almost 34 seconds to load the entire page and he was like
 I'm like 68% of people never even see that thing and I'm like that sucks and so
 that was kind of interesting and then he made another observation that for me I
 thought was super fascinating so we talked about how people like me a lot of
 times say well ugly pages convert better or your pages and like webinar
 registration pages out of video on it, you know, increased conversion, all
 sorts of stuff and he's like, you see I always thought it was because you know
 because of whatever like ugly pages convert but he's like no the problem is
 like a lot of times pretty pages take way longer to load right like a beautiful
 size and background images and all these you know video files like all that kind
 of stuff just takes longer to load and that's why people are leaving one of the
 ugly ones it's just like HTML code there's images or there's text and some stuff
 they load faster therefore therefore you know instead of 68% people leaving
 maybe drop down to 23 so you get like twice as much traffic just by increasing
 loads to be time and I thought that was fascinating and interesting so I'm gonna
 do some more testing but I wanted to show you guys with everyone as you're
 doing because I don't know 100% of you know I would say I take everything in
 grain and salt but I do think he's on to something I do think the page low time
 is interesting I do know on the clickphone slide this is something should be
 comforting to you guys Todd spends time every single month trying to decrease
 page loads speed on our side of doing stuff to optimize the pages get the code
 out faster like all those kind of things for the page loads that have been
 faster in fact I've seen over the last in probably year I've seen him shave like
 across network wide the tens of millions of pages that we people view every single
 day in ours shaving time off by multiple seconds so we're always
 optimizing our side but you guys as you're building pages and click phones just
 know that know that like man if I have a background image like how big is that
 file if it's three megs I got three of those things that's nine megs just in
 background images that's not good especially with pulling your phone or
 mobile it gets really really bad in fact we just created a new tool inside a
 funnel university for those who are funneling you members should be there by
 time you were here with image resizer I had a door on my team build a little
 software app or basically take background image you throw in the scene and we'll
 do it'll take an image it's like three or four megs you click a button and it'll
 pop the image back out looks exactly the same but it decreases the image size
 right three or four megs like 300 megabytes or whatever so like one tenth
 the size and so I'm going back to all my own images like my e-cover image is my
 picture image like all with any image I upload a click funnel to have on a page
 I'm putting back to that thing you know and shrinking the size of it to increase
 page load time and so just know those are things that you should be looking at
 because man if you can increase your conversion by 10% 20% 30% just by
 images loading faster right that's a lot of money without having to learn
 you know write a better copy or do any of those kind of things just page load
 time so Trevor Chapman thanks for bringing that top of mind to me and
 hopefully everyone who's listening in the podcast something definitely worth
