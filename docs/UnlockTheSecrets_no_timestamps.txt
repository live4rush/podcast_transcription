 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast for you
 It's probably new day, but I'm still driving to pick up day from the airport
 And I want to share with you guys behind the scenes of how I'm planning and preparing for the unlock the secrets event
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody so I'm so heading to the airport the test was so quiet
 I'm doing podcasts now and my sound quality is probably a million times always makes me laugh people right Russell
 What kind of microphone you have to do your podcast on?
 I'm like I literally have my iPhone in my hand. I got a pop socket behind it
 I hold it my fingers and I keep it the same distance for my mouth and I just talk and so
 I'm not worried about audio quality. I just want to make sure that I give you guys cool stuff and
 And you know now that I'm in a Tesla the audio quality quality's probably got up a little bit
 So I'm pumped about that for you guys
 Anyway, oh crap, I'm gonna miss my freeway entrance clip. Hang out to you guys
 All right
 I made it good thing to test the Tesla so stealthy. I can swerve in and out of people just kidding anyway
 So today what I want to talk to you is about
 I've got a lot of questions about this people asking me because we have an event coming up this year and
 It's funny because I'm gonna share this part of it because this may inspire when you guys do something similar
 You know if you look it, I've always had this problem more like I hate teaching the same thing twice, right?
 So like that's why you know when we launched click funnels and I was like I'm gonna do the same webinar live
 every single week for next year and I need to do it at five or six times a week the first two or three months like
 I was like if I say these words again, I'm gonna kill myself
 I'm so bored of them, but it obviously worked right which is why I encourage all you guys to do that
 I also have something with events. I used to do an
 events here in Boise people come into them and
 I've teach this event it was amazing then the next time we do an event people could be a different group people coming in
 I teach a whole new event people always ask like why are you teaching a new event?
 I'm like I just teach you the same thing twice, right?
 You know by the way, this is that is stupid of me
 So I'm just gonna preface that now that I'm wrong
 So just you know like yeah, that's why I feel too Russell because if you say think that you're wrong - we're both wrong
 Anyway, so for years like how to fought that and then when we finally decided to do an events again
 Funnel Hacking Live was the event right and I love fun liking I've you all should go to it. It's like our I love it
 It's it's fun and it is again. It's the event where I have a chance every single year to create
 I usually do four or five presentations like create from scratch
 They're brand new stuff that I never shared before and so I have this really fun ability to kind of get my need of
 I creation and new things and all that kind of stuff and so
 And so I do that every year. I love it
 We have other speakers come in and it's really really cool
 But anyway about a year ago is hanging out with Brendan Bouchard and we were talking about events and stuff and he was talking about
 He does two big events a year
 I think it might be changing the name of them
 but one of them is called Experts Academy and one's called High Performance Havens and
 He was making fun of me. She's like yeah when I do my events I'm on stage all day every day for like four days
 It's just me talking and I was like why didn't you do that bring the other people and he told me you said you know think about
 Tony Robbins. He's like
 What was it 30 years ago or 50 years?
 I don't know whatever was that Tony he took all his material and he sat down and he created an event
 It was called Unleash the Power Within and that became his flagship event
 And he taught it like four times a year for the last 30 years, right?
 He knows it were for word and things made tweak here and there a little bit for the most part
 It's the same event right and he created this event that would fulfill all these things and then he produced it
 And that's why it's so amazing is because gets better and better because he's done so many times
 And then like I don't know ten years later
 As he was doing one of his geek out sessions
 He like figured out this whole this new event he wanted to do and remember he talked about this the day with destiny
 And he like spent like a whole week or something wrote the whole event and then he brought a bunch of people in the room
 He did the event for people that was very first
 Day with destiny event and then that became the secondary event
 And so he and that was created like 25 years ago or whenever it was he's been doing it twice the year for the last 25 years
 And Brendan said you know what he when he got in this business
 It wasn't about doing a new event every single year was about I'm gonna create an event and that event happens all the time and
 And so for him the first one was the experts Academy
 He's done it every year for however many you know a decade now and then he created the high firms Academy one a couple years ago
 Now that's his flagship program. He does every single year and and when he's told me this I was like
 Well, I want my own flagship course
 That's just me teaching and I was kind of bummed out because I didn't have one and I was like
 I don't know how to fit in or where I would fit it in or how it worked and
 Anyways, we were planning the Tukamakla coaching program for this year
 I thought what if I didn't event that was just for
 That group and it becomes my my kind of my flagship program and then I was like wouldn't it be cool if wasn't just
 The parents got a company were able to bring their children as well like their kids
 They're not like super young kids, but like 12 to 18 year old kids and bring them as well
 And I could do this event, but in a really cool way that's different
 You know, because I can stand up I can teach for three days and I'll be awesome
 And I think people love it
 But if I can do it in a way where it's interactive enough to stimulate the adults and give them what they need
 But they entertaining enough and broken down to a level that would be so powerful that the kids
 Congrats but as well and making a family experience like that's that's the goal, right?
 And I was nervous about it, but you know in the last
 And it's crazy in the last
 However long you know few years we've got tons of kids now making so much money as I did click phones
 We've got teenagers to come look up
 We've got a whole bunch of other stuff and it's just like it's really powerful seeing them
 And so like my teenagers, it's not like you know the future we do say it's like teenagers are here now
 They're having success now like we might as well come and cater to them and serve them and like help them to understand and be on the forefront of
 Of all that and so we decided to do that this year
 So this year's our very first one I think we have about six or seven hundred people register
 I think like 250 those are our youth which I'm pumped about and so this fence happening and now
 You know we planned the event we give everyone signed up for and then I start freaking out like oh my gosh
 I gotta make sure it's good and then my kids are coming as well
 So I got like now I gotta like really make sure it's good so my kids get it
 But then it's like all my inner circle members and I want to do comic book coaching
 Students are there which are like my top of a of a client's like I gotta make it stimulating and awesome them too
 And so now I'm all stressed out and by the way
 I'm also writing a book during this period time as well as running click funnels and
 You're taking care of my kids during the summer. So there there's there's a few things, but I'm really excited for it
 And hopefully see me come my flagship
 I do it once a year for all my two comic book coaching students and that just becomes like the thing that we do and
 That's kind of the the vision and the game plan. So anyway, that's kind of why I'm doing it. So
 The question is like how do we prepare for well for me? It's it's been interesting because I'm trying to not just be me
 On stage speaking right like a lot of incidents that way I'm like I want it
 I want it like four or five levels deep and so what we're doing
 And this is always give you an example
 There's one module because it's snapshot. Hopefully it'll give you guys ideas for your own thing
 But what we're doing basically is I'm teaching the strategy, right?
 So one of the modules would be probably half a day is like is going through these different core funnels inside of a value
 I was a handful core funnels. So I'll be teaching the strategy of each one, right?
 That's number one the number two is I'll be giving a swipe file
 I here's 40 of those types of funnels that other people have done you can look at me like oh
 That's what he's talking about. See how it works here and here and here you see mobile room again, right?
 So you can swipe file number three they get the share funnel links
 It's like now you've seen it
 Here's the link you click on it and then the frame works built for you
 Then you come in there and you can just replace things and make it all pretty and nice for yourself, right?
 So that's the third phase the number four is we partner someone who's really good at making
 Trello boards they make some of the most intense insane trello boards and so for each of these funnels with these insane
 Intense amazing step-by-step by step trello boards
 They go with it to make sure you get every single step in the process right to execute one of these funnels
 Then on top of that is every single step inside the the checklist we're going through making videos
 So somebody that stuck like I can't figure out the step there'll be a video for every single set they can watch and it's like
 Oh, that's about you know super simple like a you know 30 second to a couple minute video depending on the the task that shows it
 Right so now it's not just me teaching conceptually concepts
 Like I teach it and then I show it to you and then I give it to you
 And then we hope you implement it and it's like all these different levels deep right and then after the event
 We're gonna have our our coaches doing these hackathons
 They get on it's like anybody who wants to build that funnel jumps on and everybody's group builds the funnel together no
 No
 Memory gets left behind there's always people behind like hoping to you know like let's say you I can't figure out my domain purchase like
 Like the way we do these hackathons are really cool. It's like okay everyone on this right now in the
 They're usually smaller groups like you know 30 to 40 people
 It's like everyone go buy your domain right now
 Okay, everyone get it you didn't get it and like three people got stuck
 So like hey, here's the coach go go offline if you shoot with the coach real quick
 It'll get help you big offline coach gets done to jump back in the group
 Okay, everyone's got the domain done now step number two is do this we go step by step by step until everybody's got it done
 And over the course of seven eight hours the funnel's done. It's beautiful
 It's ready to rock and roll and so you see how we're layering all these different levels
 And that's just for that one module, but it's how we're trying to really make this so that this this program is simple
 It's powerful. It's useful and and it'll be the most amazing thing ever created on this planet
 So anyway, that's the game plan and that's what it is unlock secrets event
 I'm excited for all my two comic club Xers and all of my inner circle members
 I'm excited to see you guys there and if you haven't got your ticket check go get them
 We should have about a thousand people out of I think when all said and done
 So we're about a little less than two months away
 And I'm sure you're gonna talk more about it, but that's the reason behind it
 This is gonna become my flagship just like you know, Tony's got UPW a date with Destiny and and Brendan's got his
 This is now mine. It's called unlock the secrets we go through the doc on expert and traffic secrets books and I'm pumped for it
 So anyway, that's that's that's kind of the game plan. So hope that helps
