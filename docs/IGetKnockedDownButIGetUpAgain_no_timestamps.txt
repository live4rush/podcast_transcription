 What's up everybody it's Russell Brunson welcome to a late night marketing secrets podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is also Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Everyone so hope you guys are awesome. It's a beautiful night. You're the crickets out there
 It's gonna creep you get the darker spots anyway. I hope you guys are awesome. I want to make you guys a video
 And we're on a podcast today for you guys about
 something that I
 Think is really really really really important
 There you go there's some light for those who are watching the video version you're gonna podcast. It doesn't matter you're here my voice
 All right, so I want to talk about
 Something interesting that I kind of realized today that I think is what keeps a lot of people back and
 It probably kept me back a lot when I was first getting started
 You know one thing
 Sorry, I'm looking for a mountain the pool house drinking some Keto OS because I love this stuff
 So have one every morning and one every night. It is my sweets and
 that
 Yeah, so that's what I'm doing. So that's what I'm looking for if you're wondering what I'm doing and why I'm talking weird, but
 We'll talk about is today for example
 We had a lot of crap happen
 Like not like little things either like huge things things that are devastating like things that I think in my past would have crippled
 now to stop me like oh
 and it's interesting because I
 See people nowadays who are in business and they're moving forward moving forward and they're trying to do stuff
 And not just business honestly it's like all aspects of life. It's their personal life. It's their family life
 It's their relationships like it kind of you know, it bleeds in a lot of different things, but for this you know for this
 purpose it's business where
 Something really crappy happened you have these plans and things you think are gonna be happening and then you hit this wall and you're like
 You throw your hands up in the area and you're like, I don't know what to do and so you just stop right or you just give up and
 I said I think there was a time. I probably did more of that
 and I think I'm
 I think I'm lucky because I grew up. I was a wrestler as body as know and so one thing that happened to wrestling is
 And it's probably a good thing because I was really bad at first and so like I'd get beat a lot
 In fact my brother Scott who's gonna be in this video. We first started wrestling
 He's my younger brother and he was beating me at first
 Which is like as a big brother's really embarrassing, right? And then luckily I loved wrestling
 He didn't so I was able to pass him, but he would have been beating my whole life
 Which would have been really embarrassing
 but
 But because I was getting beat at first like I wasn't like the best kid
 So I like I got beat a lot and then I came back and then like I learned how to beat people
 Probably the best example is my junior year in high school
 I was gonna my goal was be state champ with I was gonna make it and then what's interesting is as I was going for it
 my
 first match my senior year or excuse my junior year I wrestled guy Nick Fresquez from 100 high school and
 I
 Sorry, there's ice coming out
 Anyway, I told everyone I was gonna be state champ
 I was you know talking all the you know all the confident stuff and my very first match
 I was a Nick Fresquez who's returning he took it in second place to stay a year earlier
 He's turning back and he beat me my very first match the whole year and I was like devastated like oh
 Luckily for me my dad filmed the match and so what we did for the next four months every single night
 We watched that match and then we practiced on how to beat Nick Fresquez and then I never saw him
 I never like never wrestled against the rest of the year
 but then
 At the end of the year sure enough he was on the opposite
 He was right first to say in our second and we came against each other in the finals I wrestled him in the finals
 I beat him because I knew exactly his moves. I practice him every day for four months
 And in fact, I actually beat him the actual days of the story before by beat him with
 The same move that he had been he beat me with which is kind of fun
 So I was used to like getting beat up and then coming back and then learning how to win getting beat up come back and went
 So like that helped me through my life. I think in business the same thing
 I was like I would start I'd get hit with something and it was just like sometimes like hitting a roadblock
 I mean as I felt that are like hitting a wall. You're just like good stuck and like I don't know how to like I don't
 How to overcome this like this is an insurmountable object. I can't like I don't know how to overcome this and we hit those things right and so
 like that that happens all the time like I said in business and
 What's interesting is most people don't get past those like they hit the wall and then they freeze up and they stop and then they go watch TV
 or they they quit or whatever those little things are and
 It's interesting because I see that a lot with our entrepreneurs who like a little roadblock a hiccup will come and then they they just stop
 And it's like like keep I don't stop keep going keep going
 But I think that what happens is more you do it the more like your capacity increases and your ability to handle
 Those things and take them and then like plow through and keep keep moving forward on them, you know
 I mean so today like we had so many things
 Like we're so we're just launched this this viral thing if you go to who knows if it's still laughing you guys watch this
 But CF goes viral calm was this really cool thing and so
 I want to do I want to make it with somebody they opt into the sing and then they get a referral link
 And then they refer other people and they get a dollar for everyone to sign up
 And there's gonna make this huge viral thing that would grow really really fast
 And so we spent the last man like two weeks getting all the things put together
 Create a video on the sales page and the structure and the flow and the funnel and like everything was working
 We tested it and I wanted to build side click phones
 We couldn't because it's like this is feature
 We don't have right now and Todd's like we could build the future
 But we don't have time to do it because all crazy stuff's happening for the launch
 So we didn't and there was some third-party service we decided to use we use this third-party service
 We're sure trying to test all these things aren't working. We got working so it pretty much worked then we do the launch and we send
 emails out and started to Facebook live was all exciting and like
 Instantly all people start coming and it gets what happened
 boom whole thing just crashed within like minutes and
 We call the guys up their services and like do our sites around like we'll call you back. Okay, that's not good and
 The whole thing is down 15 20 minutes is down and finally see like everything goes offline
 They reset their service comes back up and it's working
 But we like pause emails and everything at the times we comes back like 15 minutes there's a case in 15 minutes
 Nothing bad has happened like you're good to go like dude
 It's because we stopped everything like we stopped the ads stop that I can we stopped everything
 Or like if you look at this like I think we had five percent of emails been sent out and we'd crush their servers and it was just like
 Just done and so where I dude you understand like we're trying to get a hundred thousand options in seven days
 I'm like to get that it's probably gonna be a million to a million half
 Maybe two million people are gonna come through your links like can you handle that and like
 Like no like we can't handle like dude you told us like we told you the numbers ahead of time like
 We've always tell us numbers, but no one ever hits it like we didn't believe that was gonna happen
 I'm like are you like we just launched as far as contest people are signed up the sharing link like we can't stop this now
 But like service wasn't working and it's just like Kate most people like
 Me five ten years ago to the like we're screwed. We're gonna do like
 But it was like okay, we gotta keep moving forward
 I what we gotta do we're gonna fix since then I messes Todd and Todd's like alright
 I'm pulling it all night, and so him it went and Jamie Smith came in and they like spent the whole next four or five hours
 Coding this whole thing out and rebuilt from the ground up entire company software that we did and then built it into ClickFunnels and
 Anyway, the testing's all done and they're gonna roll out first thing in the morning
 They were gonna relaunch the viral campaign right afterwards and hopefully get the same impact
 But it's like that could have been like devastating right and then
 And I was like one thing and it's like four
 Four five things like that yesterday just yesterday that happened like insane like it's like the bigger company gets the more fires
 They're like they're like four huge fire. No five five huge fires. I put out say that was one of five huge fires
 one of them was some Yahoo
 Causing like fist fights and threatening to kill people in our Facebook group and it happens to be a friend
 And then he comes in this and then we block and starts threatening me and like all sorts of stuff
 And it's just like like that's happening and then like the next thing and the next thing and the next thing and like all these fires are happening
 And at the same time I can't stop because there's still this launch happening
 So like I spent probably four hours
 They working on the new sales letter for when the viral video goes live which is so cool
 I gotta see it so excited and then
 Top that I gotta record like 40 videos tomorrow
 So I was writing the scripts for those and like mapping out the sequence and the timeline plus
 We're working on the event funnel for the fun hacking live
 So I had to go through finish do another round of the edits for the schedule and then message all the potential speaker
 or the speakers and invite them to speak and then getting the flow done and then like
 Then the viral video party
 We had to shift the whole timeline so we're calling Boise State and trying to shift like it was all these fires
 That's fire to fire like any one of those should have crippled us or me or who are like our entire team and like today's just stopped
 But like we didn't and kept going forward and so I don't know why I'm sharing this other than
 I think most people stop way too fast and
 And I don't know if it's just like from doing it so many times and so often and like it's funny
 Is I remember someone told me what I think Dan Kennedy told me he said that like once every
 like once every quarter
 Since we're going to record an entrepreneur will will come into a place of crisis to either make or break his company
 I'm like once a quarter like do we get that like four times a day like four quarters of the day that and consistently like
 It's crazy like the bigger we get the more those things are so I'm you know the one nice thing is typically you don't have a company blow up overnight
 So I'm lucky that you know we had I had ten years of like
 Cutting my teeth and trying to sing and and bankrupting two companies going up and down and all sorts of failures
 So the one like I had the big success like I my capacity has increased and I'm handling things pretty well
 I script a lot. Some of you guys know
 You're today. There's public scripts where a whole affiliate system that we built out crashes in the middle of the launch and
 Anyway, there's just things that happened and
 But I think again like most people they just stop too fast and it's like the only it's kind of lifting weights like the only way
 To keep moving through those things some of you guys hit those things you stop and no
 I know you're so hopefully
 Hopefully at least one or two of you guys are hearing this and it's you're saying that's me like I hit an obstacle and I freeze
 And so what I want you to understand is like it's like lifting weights
 They're like you're pushing you're pushing you can't do any more and it freezes like you can't keep going like that's that's
 That's good. That's tearing your muscles then like they repaired you gotta go back again
 You go back again. You go back again and and if you keep doing that like your capacity or increasing it better and better till someday like
 You have so many problems like me that you'll have in four or five times in a day
 and you'll just show sure get off and it'll be fine and so um
 Yeah, like that's just
 Yeah, I don't know the exact process to doing it
 It's just doing it and it's just like when I think hits you and you're like girl that sucks. All right, let's go boom
 You know
 Like if you're gonna fight some punching the face like oh that hurts so bad
 But I'm in the middle of a fight
 Let's go and then you just go right back in like that's the kind of attitude
 You got to have when I think you punch it in the face or it knocks you down or whatever because most of those things it's like
 It's like you're this far away from success in fact on the new sales letter for the click-finance page
 You'll see it
 Some you guys know like the the viral videos about a gold miner and all the stuff so there's just one image
 We have this drawing it's it says like the miner who quit too early and it shows this guy pick axing and he's like digging into this huge
 Mountain and then he's turning around he's walking away
 And then you look at the side picture
 It's like a side cut of the mountain and you see he's like an inch away from all this gold
 And it's like sometimes that's how it is like we get punched in the face
 And it's like we knock back and then we're like dang I don't want to do that and you just stop and it's like oh
 like all you do is step back up and go back in that fight one more time and then and
 You're there like you're so close to it
 That's what most people don't get to because it's like the the closer you get the more resistance
 They will be to the thing you want it's looks like as you're coming closer and closer and resistance is coming is your ability
 To get back up and keep going
 There's a song in high school the 90s that we used to play in fact
 I played it today after like getting hit in the head like five times as I hey guys
 I got a theme song to keep us going right now and it was the song I get knocked down
 I get up again like that's it like you get knocked down and you got to get back up again as fast as you can because
 The more resistance you're getting the closer you are to where you're trying to get to and just know that and so know that like
 Whenever you desire right now the closer and closer and closer gets that the more resistance
 So you have to increase your capacity to handle that those attacks
 Otherwise you will crumble underneath it and you'll never get to your goal
 But just also know that like the harder those punches are the more frustrating like all those kind of things it means you're close
 And the closer you get hardest gonna be it all son boom you're gonna be there
 But you got to be willing to get knocked down and get back up again and take that next step take a leap into faith
 Or take the leap of faith and you take that step into the dark whatever the analogies you need that's you got to do
 And when you do that
 Then that's where it's at like I think most of us maybe wrong. I think I'm right though. I think most of us
 Like the times that we fail we
 If we fail and we don't we want we're probably
 One or two like why don't you knock out away from success? It's just getting back up
 Putting the gloves back on going back into the ring one more time. That's it
 Maybe again knock down again. You like one more step one more and just it's it's there. You gotta taste it
 You gotta feel it. All right, that's enough now. Just like 40 analogies. Hope that one of those connected with you guys
 I got sports analogy that got everything in there. Anyway, all right one hand in we drink my keto's
 I'm gonna go to bed. I got a big day tomorrow. I'm gonna film like 40 videos. Oh, so no, it's fun like this one
