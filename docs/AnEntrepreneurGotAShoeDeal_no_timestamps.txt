 Good morning, good morning. This is Russell Brunson. We're welcoming you to the marketing secrets podcast today
 I'm gonna talk to you about your role your new role as an entrepreneur
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way?
 But let's us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out of the world and yet still remain
 profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answer. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so hope you guys are in amazing
 It's morning time here, but I've been awake since 3 a.m. It's one of the side benefits of jet lag is that you wake up super early in the morning
 and I couldn't fall asleep and
 Actually what happened like roll out of bed went to the bathroom came back
 I flew to my phone and I got a message from Amy McLaren saying that they found my video card
 In Kenya, which is exciting if you listened yesterday
 Basically I recorded 10 days worth of video footage
 I left the video card in the tent in the middle of Mossamar village and I wanted to cry but they found it
 So I was excited and that's what was doing to a message from stew about this partnership where I try and work on this new software
 That you guys are gonna freak out about and then I got excited so I couldn't sleep
 So I went into the office and start working on the traffic secrets book
 I got the outline flushed out and I'm so oh so excited the biggest fear I had is like how do I make a topic that is
 most non evergreen topic ever known demand traffic into an evergreen thing where it'll stand the test of time so 100 years
 So now someone can be the book and will still be 100% applicable and I've been struggling with that for almost a year
 And I finally nailed it. I'm so excited and I started wire-framing you out the software anyway
 I got so many cool things so and then I'll try to lay it back down
 I can fall sleeps and then I decided to go get eggs
 We're out of eggs
 So I drove the store to buy eggs and a store was still closed who knew that stores closed at night
 I'd send there 24 hours
 So I came back to the office worked on the hour till the store closed when back on my a's went home cook eggs bacon avocado for the kids
 And now I'm getting tired by my striving to the office
 But today as I'm driving in I'm looking at my feet and I am wearing the new
 Case Swiss Gary Vaynerchuk shoes now you may be wondering why I'm doing a podcast about these shoes a couple reasons number one
 Some you may know I'm not the biggest Gary Vaynerchuk fan in the world and I'm not gonna go into details
 Why but it stems back to when we had him speak at the bubble soccer event and just
 Anyway, I'll leave it at that. That's a story for another day. Just
 Anyway, and since then I found a lot of people have a chance to work with him kind of felt similar
 I hope my my goals if any of you guys ever meet me in person in real life that I'm not like a huge extreme
 Letdown I hope that he doesn't meet me real life like dang Russell really is a normal nice person
 That's my goal. I know sometimes like I'm awkward when people meet me and I apologize for that
 But I'm trying I'm trying to be less awkward, but like I try to be like just anyway, so that's my goal
 I'm leaving that all right, so but why am I excited?
 So I got these shoes from Gary and they're really cool
 If you ever heard his little rant on the clouds and the dirt if you open if you look inside the shoes one
 Souls clouds and one soul is dirt and then tongue is his clouds and dirt and the bottom have two different quotes
 I can't read them right now from where I'm at and they're pretty cool shoes actually like I really like them
 so I'm wearing them, but the reason I'm really really wearing them is because this represents something really really big for
 You as an entrepreneur not about most of you guys, but I wasn't born six foot nine
 I wasn't able to dunk. I wasn't able to run really fast or smash people through the the offensive line
 I wasn't able to throw a football
 I was a good wrestler, but there's not many wrestling
 Sponsorships out there unfortunately, but for me it's like you look at all these cool amazing things
 Yeah, I call these athletes have these these these sponsorship deals and it's such a cool thing and most was probably never thought that
 That would be possible for us now with the onslaught of social influencers and people big followings like there's more of this happening
 Right people are paying influencers to other products and their services and to wear stuff and all those kind of things
 And it's pretty cool, but for me these shoes represent
 Gary Vaynerchuk who's a fellow entrepreneur getting a sponsorship deal because he's an entrepreneur
 Which is exciting it's exciting for me
 You know he was probably one of the first big ones and I want to be the second big one
 So it's now now a goal and a focal point for me to try to get like a legit sponsorship from something like this
 Like a shoe company or a clothing line or I don't even know headbands hats cars
 I don't even know
 But it's exciting and so it's it's come on my radar
 I just want to share with you guys because I want you guys understand that
 Entrepreneurship is becoming cool. I didn't used to be right used to be like
 Entrepreneurs were the ones that were an employee that could get a job, right?
 But now we're in a day at a time and it's it's a timing thing
 You know you with Shark Tank and the profit all these TV shows coming out like like
 Entrepreneurship is coming cool thing
 You have all the tech stuff happening in software companies and supplement companies all these all these cool
 things where entrepreneurs are like becoming the cool person they're becoming the role models and
 unfortunately for me
 And I'm not gonna want a huge rant about this, but
 A lot of people aren't good role models and I think most of you guys who are listening here are good role models
 Otherwise you wouldn't be probably paying attention to me
 I'm not the guy who feeds the ego of of
 those who just want to hustle 24/7 and not actually care about their family and friends and and society and and
 Actually impacting and changing the world and so
 I'm guessing if you're listening to me you're probably on the same the same bandwidth and the same listen the same radio station as I am right
 same frequency, but
 I think it's exciting because we have a chance to become the next wave of role models for for other people, right?
 I think
 Entrepreneurship's gonna be taught more and more in schools. I think it's gonna be more of a cool thing
 You know people aren't gonna be trading baseball cards of the favorite football players. They're gonna be trading baseball cards
 They're favorite entrepreneurs
 Which is exciting entrepreneurs are getting deals like this are gonna be speaking they're gonna be
 guest starring in TV shows
 They're gonna be the dancing with the stars. They'll be the they'll be the stars like I really do think that
 Entrepreneurship is the is the future. It's the it's it's the cool new thing and I think all of you guys
 Including me. We're in a good spot. We're gonna get spot right now. We're we're
 We're creating products and services with a goal to change the world. We are out there working hard
 We're having an impact not just selfishly collecting on many first cells, but hopefully we're trying to
 Have some kind of external impact you're focusing on your customers
 These are all things that talked about last three or four episodes
 So you're focusing more so on your customers than yourself you're focusing on
 impacting other people who can't benefit you by buying your products your services and you're being a good human being and the cool
 thing is that that is now being rewarded and I think as all of our
 Collective followings and continue to grow as the people we serve continue to grow
 we're gonna become more and more well-known and
 Deals like this that came to Gary will be coming to people like me and people like you and I think it's exciting
 So it's the new future of entrepreneurship and should get you guys pumped. You guys excited you're kids excited
 You should tell your kids like look like this guy Gary Vaynerchuk
 He got a shoe named after and before used to be just Michael Jordan and people like that
 But now an entrepreneur someone who's trying to change the world got it and now you can have it as well
 Just because you're not six foot nine
 You can still have something like this and hopefully it it feeds the dreams and divisions and the ideas and the and the excitement
 Of this game that we're all playing so
 I love this game entrepreneurship is probably my second favorite game in the world number one is definitely wrestling
 Wrestling's not really a game, but you know what I mean
 But I love this game. It's so much fun
 I love the people we interact with the people's lives we change and it's just really cool to see
 Entrepreneurs not being recognized more and more for that
 I think it will continue to happen in the future
 But this my friends is is a turning point. So if you didn't get in your case with Gary V shoes even feel like Gary V
 You should still support him and get some because they are actually really cool shoes and like I said
 It's the future of where all the stuff's going. So with that said at the office
 I'm gonna go try get some work done before I pass out for jet lag set back in
 But if you're gonna got a full day's worth work done already and it's just a little after nine
