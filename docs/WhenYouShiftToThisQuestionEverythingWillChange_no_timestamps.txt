 What's up everyone it's Russell Brunson welcome to marketing seekers podcast I'm going to share with you guys some good news and some bad news today
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still
 remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, everybody welcome back. I'm so excited for this episode and for a couple reasons number one
 We're making some changes to the podcast as you will see over the next week or so
 And one of them is I'm no longer gonna be doing the video side of the podcast the rock n'y post is on YouTube
 They're only gonna be here for my friends who are listening and plugged in your ear
 So this is now gonna be exclusive to the podcast which I'm really excited for
 It all seems I'm gonna be able to do more of these again when I had the whole video thing and stress out like oh crap
 I'm so much a jam is or like I were the same shirt in three days in a row
 And they're gonna judge me or you know just whatever and I didn't do nearly as many podcasts
 I have all this like line up of things I had to want to talk about I never did it because
 Like honestly because I had to do video every time
 So right now I'm going audio only and I'm so excited and we're gonna start moving back forward to this as the delivery mechanism for
 The marketing to use podcast which gets me excited. So that's number one number two Todd and Ryan are in town this week
 We are
 So fun. It's amazing what we can do in a night. We basically launched entire new service last night
 We just made up our head called funnel roll at X
 Which is gonna be a huge help to all of you guys here in the very near future
 We also rebuilt the entire two comic club X coaching program to make it more simple with accountability partners checklist systems like so
 So cool. Anyway, so many fun things happening, but
 I have a list of stuff from last week's there circle me like notes of stuff
 I want to talk to you guys specifically about and one of them
 That wanted to share because it's kind of short, but I think so important
 Was just the fact that
 I don't want to break it to you guys meanlier, but like
 This is the this is the news the news is that money is not gonna make you happy
 Oh crap, so me guys are thinking now
 I think we'll see I like of course not Russell
 But I'm as interesting as I was sitting through all my inner circle means last last
 over the last couple weeks
 Which was so fun and so many amazing people there and it's funny because like one of the big themes always amongst us
 Like how do we scale our business?
 How do we scale our businesses and and that's a question that I love and I don't steer away from that because I think it's important
 You know, I'm focusing always every day
 And how do I scale my business and like that's what's marking stuff is fun for figuring out a scale businesses and it's like
 There's a fun in like the growth, right? But there's one person specifically who's trying to grow and scale at the cost of like some things that
 that
 anyway, and and ask Michael why do you want to scale and and he was like well because like
 because that's the that's the point I might yeah, but when like when is enough gonna be enough for you and
 Because they're trying to scale like eight different businesses. They're all in different markets and different segments different things
 I'm like which one you most passionate about like and like well this one for sure
 But this one's more scalable and like I can't scale this one as much
 I can't see and I'll get it coming back like the one that they love that they didn't want to focus on because they couldn't scale it and
 As big as you know outside of kind of this confines whatever and I'm like, what's the point of scaling it and like we'll
 make more money like
 Like there's a point where money
 Doesn't matter anymore
 and
 If you're not doing it because you're passionate about the people you're serving and the impact you're having you're gonna burn out and you're gonna die
 For example like last week
 There's all those things we just like you get tired sometimes or I don't know
 I was kind of kind of burned out. I haven't taken a break for like two years
 so kind of burned out a little bit not gonna lie and
 Has Lane embedding the wife had passed out or maybe she was looking or I can't remember exactly
 But I'm like like I'm like thinking I'm in the point of life
 I could buy anything on earth that I want so I'm like what do I want? I was like
 Huh, but I couldn't think of anything
 So I'm like I'm gonna go to a place where all my magical dreams can come true eBay
 I'm like everything on earth that you could ever want is for selling eBay. It's my eBay
 That was on eBay for like three or four hours
 Looking for stuff to buy I could buy anything I want on this entire set
 Like I used to get in bidding words to people and like I had to have auction sniper software to be like
 You know try to save five cents by bidding before the other person the last second and all stuff
 And I'm on eBay. I can literally buy anything I want at this point in my life like how exciting is this and?
 and four hours like I
 Was trying to find stuff and try to find things are amazing this it fired me got excited and like
 After four hours of trying I think I spent like six hundred dollars mostly on old books
 And then I was like there's nothing else on this entire site that actually what like there's nothing
 So I was six hundred fifty bucks and I was out of things to buy and I was like what I like
 Like there's no like money no longer search if there's nothing that I could do with money
 I was like man
 If my whole goal is the scale this business to make money like that's really depressing
 When there's nothing else I need or that I want like in four hours of search
 I was able to spend six hundred fifty bucks and that was it
 So the bad news is like the money like it seems really really cool, but it doesn't like there
 They'll come a point when you're pursuing business and stuff. We're like oh my gosh
 This money didn't actually matter and it's not it's gonna be confusing to you like it was confusing to me
 I'm like huh and I was like why am I still doing this?
 Why was I up last night till three in the morning in the office?
 Why did I wake up early this morning?
 Why am I doing this stuff and it's like because of the impact because of the person because the people were serving another side like
 If you're picking a business solely because it's scalable because of how much money you think you can make you're dumb
 Like that's the worst thing to ever try to focus on if you're picking a market because you're like
 I'm obsessed with those customers and I can serve them better than anybody else in the world
 And I'm gonna serve them and I'm gonna like put my heart and my soul and my life's mission into the service of that human
 Then you'll have to fulfill me you'll be able to stay up till three and I excited because you're having so much fun
 And all the good stuff will come from it and what's amazing is when you're so focused is like how do I serve these humans the
 Group the people I picked to serve the thoughts the inspiration. It'll come to your mind is insane
 You want to worry about like what should I what should I sell this person? What kind of products should I serve?
 Or should I create because when you have this hyper folks? I'm like I love these people
 I'm serving them like I'm going to change their lives and they're not gonna hit him when that becomes the focus and that's like
 What should I create these people?
 Like that's when you're in that mindset and those are the question
 This is like the hairy fairy like hokey pokey woo stuff that like I used to make fun of people about when I'm like
 No, I just need to sell crap like what's the data say like to the data is gonna be wrong
 But when you're when your mind and your heart is in that direction
 Then the universe God whatever you want to call it
 I believe is God gives you direct revelation like this is how you can serve that person and it's like oh my gosh
 Like that's amazing and then hey, this is how else you can serve them like last night the whole funnel rolled
 Ex thing like I don't like yes, it'll probably become a hyper profitable
 Multi-million dollar year segment of our business moving forward, which is awesome
 But guess what like that wasn't the purpose the purpose is like I was like all my people are struggling because they can't do all the pieces
 They're like 20 different things you have to do to build a funnel and some of them are getting good at copy
 But they suck a design some good design this like a copy and there's people that are good the technical
 But they suck at the other part it's like ah and say what if we build a funnel rolled extra?
 We aggregated like here's 30 good copywriters. Here's 50 good designers
 There's 20 good funnel build and like made this roll it actually when come and they can find it
 I'm like oh my gosh like that would save everybody because now it's like no longer they get stuck
 They just go to funnel roll X they find a person to do the job
 They go back to the podcast. I did a couple weeks like a week or two go the who not the house like hey
 Sit figure out the how to do each the step who's the who okay?
 So fun roll that's like literally the the tag wide is
 The who not the house was like here's the who like they're all here categorized based on what they do and like that whole idea came
 I'm like how do I serve our customers like I had nothing to do like okay?
 How can we maximize revenue and how can we scale this is like no we love our customers?
 We actually want them to succeed. So how do we do that like what if we gave them this would like change their life?
 Oh amazing. That's like we make money on this like oh yeah, it's actually really easy
 This would be like a hyper-profitable part of our business
 But that wasn't the focus because if I were to have the folks like how do I scale this funnel rolled X never been born to call a club
 X like new stuff we're doing then never would have been born okay
 It all came off of like how do we serve these people we love them?
 We want them to succeed and then it's like God tells you like this is how you do it like oh my gosh
 I never thought of that. Thank you very much for the inspiration. So
 Shift your focus you guys from the money because the money does not matter
 If the money really matters go get a credit card for 650 bucks and go to eBay spend four hours blowing it all and then you'd be like
 Huh that sucked now now what I'm I can do the rest of my life
 And it's gonna be really hollow and really really empty if it's about the money
 I promise you that can't they how many multi millionaire people I know who are broken and they're empty
 Because they were focusing on this thing they were chasing the almighty dollar
 The weirdest thing is when you stop chasing the almighty dollar it starts flooding to you and you'll get more than you can ever dream of
 So there you go serve your customers have fun with it
 They are amazing people and they need you to change their lives
 They can't do it on their own they need you and so you got to figure that out
 It is your mission is your calling to figure out how to serve those people
 So number one if you don't know who's people are it's time to get hyper focus on that
 Figure out who your avatar who your customer who are the people you're gonna be obsessed about serving find figure out whose people are and
 They start thinking how can I serve these people how can I serve them and you do that?
 That's the right question. Yes the right question you the right answers
 So folks on that and you'll change their life and you'll be forever remembered because of that
 So there's your legacy, which is what we all really want. So anyway that said I'm heading in to go work on my life
 legacy appreciate you guys we love you we care about you and
