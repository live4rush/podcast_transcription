 Hey, what's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the marketing series podcast today
 I'm gonna recap some of the cool stuff that happened if I'm like in live 2021 day number two
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so last episode I told you guys some of the cool stuff happening in day number one
 Why can't you kind of the structure the outline the reasoning why we did a lot of those things?
 And talk about some of the speakers who are amazing
 And I'm gonna talk about day number two. So day number two
 This is the day where typically we have our mini reveal of something right usually click funnels related two years ago
 It was funnel flicks
 The other years it was like action edX other years it was things like that and
 For day two here we're excited because it was our big reveal day for click funnels 2.0 and so everything in this day was kind of
 Just tied around that and getting built into the hype and excitement and like the energy
 To release click phones 2.0
 And so the day began in the morning as it normally does
 with Trent Sheldon and Trent is
 Such an amazing speaker and I want him to talk about building a following
 We're not just like a following like if you look at Trent by hanging out with him privately. It's crazy. He'll spend
 I don't know an hour an hour and a half every single day
 Just responding to all his fans and followers and like social media people which is crazy because his following is not small by any stretch
 Most people myself included like we push things out
 But we don't really good at communicating and stuff like that and the reason why Trent's fans are such die-hards is because
 He's their form and he's communicating with them and so he talked about that but a lot of other like amazing things and
 It was interesting because
 Trent I want to speak like from stage a couple times and he usually does this like
 What's it called like a spoken word thing and I didn't ask him to do that
 But I was like hoping he was going to and as yet on speaking he got the pointers time ran out
 I was like ah dang it
 Like I was really looking forward to that and then the very end of his presentation with time ran
 He ran up on stage and then also the music started playing and I was like oh he's gonna do it
 And he did it and it was amazing and the very end of it even tied in like one funnel way into
 It was so cool. I show a podcast up
 So just playing that like spoken word thing that you just listen to over and over and over and over again
 But it's all about like making sure that you don't die with like these
 You know like things that you wanted to do like the dreams and the aspirations and things like that
 Like make sure you go and do them now while you while you can so anyway, Trent was amazing as always
 after that we started
 kind of
 Getting into publishing stuff and so
 first was the next speaker was Krista Mashor who was talking about how she creates ads and videos
 And drives paid ads to him there aren't so much to sell but they're to like build up the relationship to people and then from there
 You know ideally they'll go and they'll they'll buy stuff from you and add number two add number three and things like that
 And Krista's got as much energy if not more than me. She speaks faster than me, which is awesome and she's a great job
 after that
 McCall Jones came and spoke about charisma hacking and McCall was when I was really excited for because last year
 She showed up at flanak and live just as an attendee to support her sister-in-law who was speaking
 and
 then
 she like fell in love with what we all do and created her own movement called charisma hacking and it was really cool and she had
 developed this whole like
 Christmas hacking system and process which was
 Really fascinating to see
 She took this thing that was an idea
 She had a year you know a year and a half ago the first thought you know
 I can get live that she came to and turn into like an actual science and so I think not only was her presentation cool
 It was just cool to see
 How each of us have like these frameworks that is ideas that we have right?
 But it's like how do you keep developing and developing and developing make it better and better and better and more?
 You know more clear more simple and I didn't really realize how of all of her charisma hacking frameworks had become until she shared
 It shared with my collab and I was like oh these are just like so exciting so cool
 Anyway, she crushed it and and so that was all about cruising hacking
 Like how do you look other people who have different types of charisma?
 And how do you how do you model those because from most of us me included?
 You know I wasn't born this way didn't have talent that know how to speak on stage or do podcasts or any of these things right and
 A lot of it came from modeling people I look up to and like and that's what charisma hacking is a lot about right
 It's looking at those things and finding the patterns and finding who you resonate with is you're kind of figuring out your voice
 And how to speak and how to present things like that, which is awesome
 After McCall spoke JLD from entrepreneur fire spoke about podcasting and podcasting for funnels and a whole bunch of cool things like that
 He crushed it as always
 It's been fun because JLD's been a lot of fun hockey lives
 And it was the first time he's actually had chance to speak and it was awesome
 I've hit him on him on stage and then to wrap out before lunch
 We had Mike and AJ come and do a presentation about a funnel hub and some people
 We're wondering like didn't they speak last year about funnel hubs and the answer is yes
 They did and the reason why I wanted them to speak again because funnel hubs is a big part of
 ClickFunnels 2.0 and so I wanted to kind of bring back people's
 Minds that intention this concept of a funnel hub, which was really cool. So Mike and AJ came and spoke on that
 And then from there broke to lunch
 And after lunch we started shifting over more to like e-commerce supplements things like that
 So the next speaker we had a dual speaker. It was Matt and Jason
 he or they
 they are
 Uncle cousin or I uncle nephew or whatever
 I think that they've I think it's like one out of every seventeen two comma club awards goes to them
 And so they talked about kind of how they how they figure out their stuff because it's interesting like most people go and like oh
 I'm excited by blah. I'm gonna go build a business around blah. We're there the opposite they
 They go and they do the market research figure like what's what's hot?
 What are people buying today?
 And then they figure that out when they figure exactly where they get the traffic from they're not trying to you know
 Think those things, you know, they're not trying to guess they don't this is the this is the where we can get traffic
 This is what people are buying right now
 And then they go and they reverse engineer that and from there they create products plug them in and boom to comic club awards over and over and over and over again
 It was kind of cool to see their process. I do wish they would show a little more
 They're kind of secretive about what they do
 And I wish they would have showed us their landing pages and stuff and fortunately didn't but
 Conceptually they did share kind of their process, which was cool
 After that brave in our grant spoke
 He has a bunch of cool supplement funnels
 And then I had him talk about the difference in funnels and cars because this is where people getting all sorts of fights in our world
 It's like well, I have the Shopify store like well, I have a funnel. It's like blah blah blah
 It's like no you have to understand make these two things actually work hand in hand one thing
 He talked about that was really cool
 We talked about when he read the doc on seekers book and you learn about value ladders and back ends and all these things
 He's just like this doesn't make sense for me because I have a supplement company and then later he realized
 Oh my gosh the cart is the back end for supplement companies funnels what you use to acquire customer profitably
 And then the card is where you actually make your profit
 And you kind of showed the how these two things work together which was strategic for a couple reasons number one
 It's how he has built his businesses as big as he has which is cool
 but he's used Shopify first cards, but
 Todd and I were about to reveal click from a super no which actually had shopping carts built in
 Spoiler alert and so after he talked about that then Todd and I came out
 And we did the actual big reveal presentation where we had a chance to show people how click from super no how all these things
 That people talk about today like funnel hubs is the key like everything is based on the funnel hub
 And then from there we got our shopping cart you put in that and from there you build out your funnels
 And like it's just thought through differently and it's it's really really cool. So
 Yeah, that's kind of taught and I did the big click once you put on reveal people freaked out
 We could give everyone beta access for free with whole to bonuses and challenges
 And it's another weird reason why you need to be a fun-working live because everyone now like literally thousands of people all my friends
 I know like everyone's messing big how do we get click folks 2.0?
 I want to freak out how do I sign up my god?
 Well if you're a fun-working live you'd have one otherwise you don't so be a fun-working live
 So even to my friends you keep begging me. Sorry make sure you don't miss the event because we reward people who show up
 And so yeah everyone who was there has access to it kind of we're doing a drip release and so next month
 We're gonna be releasing funnel hubs and we'll do a challenge with that and let people access to it
 They can kind of see it they can play with it
 They can use it and then I'll be the first feature and then the next month will do courses and unlock the courses and they can do that
 and not that it opens up the shopping carts and then
 Other things so on and so forth. So that's kind of what's happening there, which is
 Which is awesome?
 So we had a good time there
 Give them these cool t-shirts and stuff when they sign up for free
 And I think we signed up like almost everyone was 100% of the people that they've had signed up for a quick follow
 2.0, which was cool
 And then we broke to dinner and after dinner we actually normally we do our award ceremony to comic awards on day
 Day three, but we decided this time to do them on day number two
 partially because it's really brutal on me usually is date your day to your day three like I
 You know we do the award show take picture a thousand people and then from there then I do my sales presentation
 And after that we get pictures everyone who bought and then after it's like the longest day of all time and so
 We just had shifted around and kind of see if it would work and it did which was great
 So we did the word ceremony Tuesday night
 Give out two comic club awards and we told everyone make after the two comic club awards that we have a guest can't tell you it is yet
 You're gonna freak out like make sure you're
 You know make sure you show up for it. It's after the words were done
 Then our special guest showed up and the special guest was
 it is
 Dan Kennedy and we made an announcement at the funnel I can live that we actually purchased Dan like I bought Dan Kennedy's company
 Which is crazy when I got into this business
 That's who I learned from initially in fact this day still who I studied the most
 But it came up for sale and I thought it'd be really good
 You know marriage and partnership with ClickFunnels and so
 We bought his company recently and then we announced it here at the event and then Dan spoke and some years
 I've done almost died two years ago and so
 But man, he's still sharp as a whip. He was awesome
 And because that he didn't he used to just get on stage and speak
 But I want something there to kind of help interview and facilitate
 So I got a chance to actually interview him from stage and facilitate it which was like insanely cool
 and
 It's just go for an hour. I mean going for over two hours and it's like it was so funny
 I think it was the first time he'd been in front of a big stage big audience like that since since his
 You know since he got sick, which was probably four or five years ago now
 Me three anyway pretty covid for sure and it was you know a year year to before that as well
 So anyway, it's so cool to hear a lot of the stories
 I've been hearing for you know for years
 I gotta have a chance like ask the questions and set up the set it up from tell like the story that I knew that I wanted to
 To hear you know and that was really special really cool
 And the fact some people were just like oh my little Dan can he was out of I would have showed up
 It's like yeah, that's why you have to show up because you have no idea what we're gonna do
 We're always surprising you guys are always making this better and cooler and all sorts of stuff like that. So
 anyway, so that was
 Really special having having Dan speak and I was gonna do another presentation at the end called follow-up funnels
 And by the time it was just it was late everyone's tired
 I'm like, you know what I'm not gonna do this
 But we made this really cool book that basically showed everyone like my 64 email email sequence or whatever it was
 So we gave him a book and I talked about for two minutes
 I was like that's it. Let's go to bed. That was the end of
 Day number two and so man
 It was like it was it was magical the whole thing was just cool ending with Dan on stage was was amazing and
 And gave people excited about the click from super no give them signed up like it was just it was like a perfect day
 So anyway, you haven't been to fun hiking live yet in the past
 Not that I'm trying to sell you on tickets, but I used to get your tickets next year's gonna be even crazier
 we were gonna be back in Orlando again and
 We haven't launched the sales video anything so tickets are there kind of a discount funnel hacking live calm
 That's funnel hacking live calm
 But make sure you take it because we'll sell every year we sold out this year
 We more than doubled as many tickets as we sold last year
 Which is crazy because we've because last year was like our best sales year ever so we've already we're already almost
 2000 tickets sold for next year's event so
 Yeah, if you're thinking about it, you should just go get a ticket because they're gonna be gone and you don't want to miss it
 anyway, but that said that's a recap at a number two and
 Tomorrow's our next episode. I'll share with you guys
 happen on day three day four and
 Yeah, give you guys a little glimpse behind some of the magic that happens on a lucky life. Thanks so much you guys and we'll talk to you soon
