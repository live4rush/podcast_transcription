 You're listening to marketing secrets with your host, Russell Brunson.
 I can't believe it's been a year, so we're hanging out.
 Welcome back, you guys.
 How are you all feeling today?
 This is crazy.
 So just, you guys know, this is the biggest photo hockey live we've ever had.
 You guys know that?
 This is so crazy.
 I'm like, there's no way we can get more people.
 There's no way.
 And like, every year, you guys see coming back and you're bringing your friends, you're
 bringing more people.
 I am so just honored and blessed to be here today.
 And for the next four days, to serve you guys, we've been working so hard on our side to get
 everything prepared and ready for you guys.
 I know that there's going to be people in this room who are here.
 Some of you guys may be unsure, you're nervous, all the different things.
 But my hope and my prayer for the next couple of days is that so many of you guys have
 a chance to change your lives.
 And not so much just for you, but also because I believe, and I'm going to talk about this
 today, but I believe every single one of you guys have been called to change a group
 of people's lives as well.
 And so I want to change your life so you can change their life and so we can keep the
 world an amazing place.
 So that's going to be happening over the next couple of days.
 It's going to be so much fun.
 And I just want to just watch to you guys.
 This is the coolest thing in the world.
 Thank you very much.
 So to begin with, I wanted to start with showing you guys the throw slides up, the quote on
 the back of your guys shirt.
 When we built ClickFunnels, one of the biggest things we wanted was we wanted to create more
 than just like a software product or something like that, we wanted to build a community
 of people.
 And so for the last two or three years I had this quote on the back of your guys' shirts
 me first come in because I want you guys feeling this way that we're here, or a community,
 we're a family.
 On the back of your shirts it says, surround yourself with the dreamers and the doers, the
 believers and the thinkers.
 And most of all, surround yourself with those who see greatness within you even when you
 don't see it yourself.
 How many times have you ever been there?
 I see it in him and her and all these other people, but not myself.
 You're in a group right now of peers of people just like you.
 You have over 100,000 people inside of ClickFunnels and you're the five or six thousand who are
 the crazies who came here who are the most excited and most passionate who want to change
 the world the most.
 And so even though you may not be able to see it, I see it in all you guys.
 The people around you see it.
 So remember that we're a community, we're a family here and I help raise and elevate
 each other all together, which is so cool.
 Yes.
 [applause]
 So my presentation, I've been really excited about this presentation and very nervous at
 the same time.
 The presentation that I wanted to give you guys today, the title of it is called The
 Drifter versus the Driven.
 If I can pull that up there.
 And before I get into this too deep, I wanted to tell you guys a story.
 Yes, cool.
 Just a story time for a few minutes.
 Okay.
 So I've got something really special here to show you guys.
 And this is something that I've been freaking out about.
 I didn't think it was going to be possible and this morning it showed up here at the
 hotel and it's something really, really cool.
 How many of you guys know who my favorite author is?
 Say a lot.
 I can't hear you.
 Okay.
 So Napoleon Hill, one of my favorite authors of all time.
 And it's been crazy for last year or so.
 I've been working with the Napoleon Hill Foundation and Don Grady, a bunch of things.
 Like two weeks ago, I believe Justin bent one of our inner circle members to Justin
 Round of applause.
 So Justin flew out there and had a chance to meet with all of them and negotiated a
 deal with them where we could actually have here on the stage today the actual typewriter
 that Napoleon Hill wrote, "Think and Girl Rich" on.
 Do you guys want to see it?
 To check this out, this is the actual typewriter that he wrote that book on.
 Is that crazy?
 Do you know the camera soon?
 Yes, show everybody.
 Okay.
 Now, Justin, we love you.
 And not only that, so "Think and Girl Rich" is an amazing book, but actually my favorite
 book by Napoleon Hill is a book called "Outwitting the Devil."
 How many of you have had a chance to read "Outwitting the Devil?"
 Yes.
 This right here is the original manuscript "Outwitting the Devil."
 It was typed on this typewriter.
 Is that the craziest thing in the world?
 Can you imagine, like, yes.
 Like Napoleon Hill sitting on this typewriter typing these words that became this book,
 this changed my life and changed so many of your guys' lives as well.
 So this is just kind of a special thing that Justin was able to pull off before this whole
 event started, which is really cool because, like I said, the title of this presentation
 is called "The Drifter vs. the Driven," which is the whole thought that I kind of got
 when I started reading that book.
 When you read that book, it's really interesting.
 If you look at the timeline of events, it's really fun.
 So Napoleon Hill sat down in 1937 and wrote "Think and Girl Rich" on this typewriter
 right here and then published it to the world and became one of the greatest selling books
 of all time.
 I think it sold over 100 million copies at this point.
 And then the next year, he sat there, he was inspired, he felt this calling, he sat
 down, put a piece of paper and started typing the manuscript throughout "Witting the Devil."
 And he wrote this book, which is, again, one of my favorite books of all time.
 And when he got done writing it, he said, "If I publish this right now, he's like,
 'People will destroy me.
 I get snot ready for today.
 Like if I do this, it's going to be really bad.'"
 And so he never published it during his lifetime.
 He passed away in 1970 and his wife ended up getting the manuscript and she looked at
 it and she was like, "I can't publish this either.
 It's too controversial.
 It's too many things.
 It's not like the world's not ready for you."
 And so she had it when she passed away, got passed on, next person and next person finally
 eventually got in the hands of the Polio Foundation and they decided it was time to
 actually publish it.
 And so they published this book and it was a book that was written, like I said, 100 years
 ago that was written for today for all of us.
 And it's just such an amazing book.
 And in the book, it's interesting.
 I'm going to be careful of the stages she's.
 I'm going to lose my clicker sometime.
 I'll leave it somewhere.
 In this book, the premise is he's having this conversation with the devil where the devil
 has to tell him anything he wants.
 And so Napoleon Hill has his chance, like, "I asked the devil anything I want.
 What should I ask him?"
 And this is what he asked him.
 He said, "Tell me all the tricks by which you enter into and you control the minds of
 men.
 You want to know, like, what do you do?
 Like, I've seen this happening all over the place.
 Like, what are the things you do to get inside the minds of men to control them from not
 doing good, from not living up to their missions, their purpose, to what they're capable of
 doing?"
 And the devil wrote back or talked him back and said, "The greatest weapon I have over
 human beings is I established the habit of drifting."
 And then in this book, he goes on and talks about people who are drifters and people who
 are non-drifters.
 And I started to read this and, like, as he's going through, like, people who are drifters
 and they're like, "There are tendencies and what they do and why they do and things like
 that."
 Like, I did not resonate with that.
 And I didn't resonate honestly with the word non-drifting as well.
 And I was like, "What's a word like that?
 I don't want to be a non-drifter.
 I want to be something more powerful, something more amazing."
 And so the phrase I started using about a year ago is like, "I'm not a drifter.
 I'm driven.
 I'm the first person who's driven."
 And so that's what this title, this presentation, is the drifter versus the driven.
 Because you guys are here in the room of a whole bunch of driven people.
 And I'm curious, how many guys before you came here, there were friends, people you love,
 people you care about who are like, "Why are you going to this event?"
 You're going to Florida to go talk about marketing with a bunch of nerds in a room for four days.
 How much did you spend over here, right?
 Right?
 Most of the people we love and care about, they're not driven like we are.
 And I think that we're crazy.
 How many of us have someone you love that thinks you're crazy or being here right now?
 Okay.
 But we are the driven.
 We understand that we're a little bit crazy.
 We're a little bit different, right?
 And so the first thing we want to talk about is this concept of drifting.
 Because I want to make sure that we are careful that we don't become drifters and we don't
 fall back into those ways.
 Let's see.
 So throughout this weekend, you're going to hear a lot about this principle of the hero's
 journey.
 Have me hasn't heard about the hero's journey before?
 Okay.
 I'm going to talk about Bill Allen's going to talk about a lot of thinking two days from
 now, which is like, he's going to geek out with you guys.
 I have so much fun.
 But the basis premise, those who don't know, is throughout history, throughout time, they're
 every generation, every cultural group around the world, when they went back and started
 studying everybody's stories and things like that, every story kind of followed the exact
 same story timeline, right?
 And Joseph Campbell was the first to kind of identify it.
 He wrote a book called The Hero with a Thousand Faces.
 They kind of mapped out like every hero in every journey, every single story followed
 the same process.
 After that, a whole bunch of other amazing people have taken it and figured out different
 ways to teach it.
 I taught a lot about it in the expert's secrets book.
 But if you look at that, it's interesting because in every single journey, it starts
 with you, right?
 You are this person.
 You are the hero.
 Okay?
 You think I had any book, any movie, any story, your story.
 There's a reason I used to hear today, right?
 We all start and we start in this place called The Ordinary World.
 That says Ordinary World.
 I have a horrible handwriting.
 I apologize to advance.
 But now there's the legend.
 That means Ordinary World.
 So we start in this thing, right?
 What is the Ordinary World?
 And we all want to achieve something.
 We have some dreams, some visions, something we want to go for, right?
 We have this thing over here.
 This is this target we're going for.
 There's a target.
 We want to achieve this thing, right?
 It's our journey of achievement, right?
 We want to achieve this thing.
 And sometimes in our life, we're sitting here and we're in our normal world.
 So for all of you guys, your normal world is wherever you live, right?
 You're in your home.
 You're doing something, right?
 So you're comfortable, everything's fine.
 Nothing's bad, but you're just like, "I'm comfortable."
 And all of a sudden you hear the call.
 Okay?
 He calls it and they call it in the heroes' journey called the call of adventure, right?
 And to hear this call of adventure, the call happens.
 And all of a sudden you're like, "Wait, what is that?"
 And you feel it.
 It may not be an audible call, but you feel it.
 How many of you hasn't felt that before?
 You felt that call of like, "Ah, I'm made for something more."
 Right?
 I'm made for something great.
 And you feel that calling and you're like, "Ah."
 And all of a sudden, if you look at the timeline of the heroes' journey, it always happens.
 It's the hero hears the call of adventure, right?
 And they get excited.
 They want to move forward and then something happens.
 Immediately, every single time in every single story, throughout time, throughout history,
 throughout every single culture around the world, after the hero's, after the hero
 called adventure, the first thing happens is the hero refuses the call.
 No, no, no, no.
 No, I'm not ready for that.
 I'm not worthy for that.
 I look like I'm 11 years old.
 I'm scared to death.
 I talk too fast.
 I don't want to be on stage.
 It's like, I'm so introverted and scared.
 Like, no, no, I don't do anything but not that.
 I want to achieve that, but like, I'm not willing to do that.
 The first thing hits every single time is refusal the call, right?
 And so this direction right here is faith.
 Like, I'm going to do that thing and also I'm here to the refusal the call, which is
 fear.
 And that fear hits us, right?
 I'm not ready.
 I'm not worthy.
 I don't know if I can do this.
 I don't have the talents on the abilities.
 Like, what am I going to do, right?
 We have the refusal of the call.
 Okay.
 The difference between the driven and the drifters, the driven in spite of that, they
 have the same fear, right?
 But instead the refusal of the call happens and they say, no, like, I'm going to do it.
 I feel I hear the calling so loud, so like, it keeps happening, it keeps beating, it's
 pulsing.
 I got to follow that thing, right?
 And we still go, we pursue it.
 And those who decide to not follow fear, we follow faith, these are the driven, these
 are the ones who are going and trying to achieve something.
 These are you guys here in this room today.
 Okay?
 You give yourself some applause for that.
 And so, yes.
 So that's where this whole thing begins with, okay?
 Those who drift, it's not because they're bad people, it's because they hear the call
 and they get scared and the fear overcomes them, they don't do anything.
 They stop and they hold back, right?
 Ryan Moran, who owns capillas.com, one of my friends, he says something so powerful
 at one time.
 He was trying to define what an entrepreneur was.
 He said, an entrepreneur is somebody who decides to take personal responsibility for
 a problem that's not their own.
 Is that powerful?
 Right?
 We hear this call like, why?
 Like, I think about, man, like 20 years ago when I got started in this game, I was 20
 years old.
 I didn't know anything about business or marketing.
 I had a, I shouldn't tell my, I have three of my kids in this room, kids being covered
 years.
 I had a cumulative 2.1 GPA in college.
 I was not smart.
 I had a lot of people who had a lot of people who had a lot of people who had a lot of people.
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 What?
 I was like, what?
 I was like, what?
 What?
 What?
 What?
 What?
 What?
 I was like, what?
 I mean, like, when I got started in this game, it didn't make any sense at all.
 I remember, in fact, I was going to tell you a little bit earlier, but when I first got
 into the, oh, I'm going to come back to that because I don't want to miss it.
 They'll only forget.
 So I'll come back.
 So this is what the devil said back to Napoleon Hill because he asked me, what does the drift
 or what does that mean?
 It's the drifter of someone who accepts whatever life throws in his way.
 He doesn't know what he wants from life and spends most of his time getting just that.
 The opposite of that, the driven, we know what we want.
 We have definite a purpose.
 Like, that's the thing I want.
 That's the goal I'm going for.
 That's what I'm moving towards, right?
 We know what that thing is.
 You guys want to be in this room if you didn't know something like, I want something different.
 I want something more.
 Maybe you don't know exactly what it is yet?
 You're like, man, whatever these people in this room have, I want that.
 Like, what experience I want to feel that, right?
 And so you have a direction, motion, you're moving forward, which is unique, which is different
 than most people.
 Okay.
 So faith versus fear.
 The next piece of the puzzle.
 So you have each of you guys here.
 You have the drifter.
 You have the driven, right?
 And then this is you as a person.
 Like I said, every single day you have this disability, right?
 To choose to move forward in faith.
 Like, in faith is a fascinating thing.
 With faith, you don't know what the answer is.
 You don't know where you're going to go.
 Like, I mean, he's got this business like, oh, no, exactly what I'm going to do.
 I know exactly what I'm going to do it.
 None of us do, right?
 We just have a goal.
 The thing you want to accomplish, then you start going like, I hope we figure this out
 somewhere before I run out of money, before I get tired, before like my spouse kicks me
 out, or I'm trying to figure this out, like you're moving forward in faith because we
 don't know what it is yet.
 We're moving as best we can.
 So the drifter moved forward in faith.
 The drifters, they stop.
 They get paralyzed with fear.
 Okay.
 Said in another way, those who are the driven are those who act.
 And those who are drifters are people who are acted upon.
 Okay.
 I want to be someone who is someone who acts.
 Now what's interesting, if you look at this, it doesn't matter which direction you go.
 As you start doing either of these things over and over again, if you start moving forward
 in faith, consistently over and over and over again, you're going to develop a pattern of
 moving forward in faith.
 If you start to use fear over and over and over again, you start building a pattern of
 fear.
 Okay.
 And to pull a hill call this hypnotic rhythm.
 You said if you're going here, you start building things like hypnotic rhythm.
 It's like a, almost like a whirlpool, you get stuck in this thing, right?
 It's like a tractor out in the field that's going around and it's in the mud with this
 big tires, these buildings, ruts, the ruts get deeper and deeper and deeper and eventually
 it's hard to get out of it, right?
 But saying these through, if you're over here moving forward in faith, you start building
 these patterns that go over and over and over again and you're able to move forward
 and to be someone who's driven, right?
 And so it doesn't matter which direction you're going, you're getting these rhythms,
 either positive rhythms or negative rhythms.
 It all comes off of like, what is the thing we're choosing?
 Which direction are we going?
 Okay?
 And so I want to talk about this because so many times in my life and your life, like,
 we have this opportunity.
 This is us every single day, right?
 We're here and an option comes to us.
 Do I show up?
 Do I not show up, right?
 Do I choose faith?
 Do I choose fear?
 This is not something you pick once and that's the pattern for your life.
 You pick it over and over and over again until it becomes hypnotic rhythm, until it becomes
 something that's part of you, right?
 That's not going away.
 I start thinking about just different times in my life where I was scared, right?
 Where I heard the calling, do the singing, and also I got the refusal to call like,
 "No, you're not good enough, Russell."
 Like, "Oh no, I know, but like, I feel like I need to do this thing.
 You're not ready.
 You're not worthy.
 You're not like all the things I know.
 I know, but like, I want that thing really, really bad."
 And so I decided to move forward in faith.
 Okay?
 The first time in my life that I can say that this actually happened to me because I literally
 was a drifter my entire life until 8th grade when my dad convinced me to go into wrestling.
 And I started wrestling and very quickly I found out that I loved it and I wanted to do
 it.
 And after my first year I told all the guys on my team, "So I'm going to be a state champion.
 I'm going to be a state champ."
 And they all started laughing at me.
 "But dude, you're like the worst on the team.
 You're not going to be a state champ."
 Like, "Yeah, I am."
 Like, "No, you're not."
 And they made fun of me and they teased me and they mocked me and they beat me up over
 and over and over and over again.
 But I was like, "That's the goal.
 That's where I'm going."
 So I kept moving forward in faith and moving forward in faith.
 And eventually the people were beating me up.
 I got better.
 And I got better.
 Eventually I was able to get spot where I could beat them.
 And I could beat the other people and eventually I became a state champ.
 And I was like, "What's up?"
 And I was like, "What's going on?"
 And I was like, "What's going on?"
 And I was like, "What's going on?"
 And I was like, "What's going on?"
 And I was like, "What's going on?"
 And I was like, "What's going on?"
 And I was like, "What's going on?"
 And I was like, "What's going on?"
