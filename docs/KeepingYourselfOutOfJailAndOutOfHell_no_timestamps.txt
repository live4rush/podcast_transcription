 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing secrets podcast and as you can probably tell if you're listening
 We're finally once again streaming from inside of my Jeep which gets me excited
 And today's episode is called
 How to stay out of jail and hell all right let's have some fun
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Okay, so
 We're gonna close fourth in July my sister and her family are over and it's been fun
 and we're hanging out last night on the fill watching our kids play soccer till like midnight and
 We're talking about business and things and it was funny because she I was teasing her and I teased my wife
 And he's a lot of my close friends who are rulekeepers. I was kind of teasing him like you guys like like you follow
 Every single rule and it drives me crazy and I'm like I'm a rule breaker and my sister came back
 And she's like she's like you you are kind of a rule breaker
 She's like but also like I know you I've known you since before you were born. You know, you're my entire life
 My sister's known me and she's like you're also like you keep you keep the rules like you're very strict
 like I have rules around you know anyway, I have these rules I keep and
 I thought for a second I said, you know what it is and I said I think I think I know what it is and I said
 Okay, if you look at this like imagine a circle right and inside that and then around this circle
 I have all these barriers right and these are all my my moral rules
 And so I have these moral rules of things that I that I will not break right my thou shall not like thou shall not kill
 Thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not fornicate thou shall not write all those kindings
 But I have my own that there that are in there
 I and these are all the rules I have to keep myself out of hell because I don't want to go to hell someday, right?
 So it's like and and we could talk forever about like what my belief is on that but
 Anyway, but I have these I have a moral compass these moral blocks and and I'm very strict on those right like
 I'm a rulekeeper like I when it comes to those kind of things like things I believe came from God
 They're like thou shall not I follow those rules very very very very strict because I
 Believe that they are vital and essential right then if you look at circle then you go out to like a bigger circle
 Like like imagine the little circles inside that has all my thou shall not said like my my moral compass
 And then you go in the outer rim like a bigger circle that's that's out
 So the little circles inside of that one right so they get the outer circle big huge outer circle
 These are all the things that the rules that if I break will put me into jail, right? And so it's like
 You can't you know, you can't you can't steal from people you can't lie
 I guess these are probably moral ones as well, but like these bigger rules right like you can't
 I'm trying to think of the best way explain it
 We went to explain to my sister yesterday. I said
 You know, I'm I watch shows like American greed
 I love American greed if you guys haven't watched that you should watch it
 And the reason why it's so good is because it's like all these scams that happen to people end up in jail
 And what's amazing is that like half the time I watch those and I was like, oh, that's a good idea
 And I'm like, you know halfway through the show you're like, oh my gosh, that's illegal. Whoa
 I didn't even know that was a law. Holy crap. Okay, note to self. There's an outer limit
 Like there's a rule I can't break, you know, and it's like all these brilliant things that try out there illegal
 a lot of things we don't know what's illegal because we're just like we're entrepreneurs
 We're just running it and and if you're not aware of like the outer limits of like if you break these you can and we'll go to jail
 You can you can trouble in fact there were probably seven or eight years ago
 I made this offer and I was like this is the greatest offer of all time and we launched it
 we sold it and we sold the crap out of it and I
 Was so excited I remember I came back and I was telling my dad about he was trying to have me explain to him
 So I explained to him three or four times and my dad's like you you can't do that
 I'm like when I was like what you just sold is security. I'm like, I don't know that means he's like
 He's a gift of securities license to sell securities and what you sold technically is a security and if and if the government finds out
 What you did like you can go to jail for that. I was like what?
 Okay, I had no idea and so I started freaking out like I don't understand security law
 So I was like trying to learn those and understand them and like figure out like oh my gosh
 She sings I did and this is why what I did was illegal
 I didn't even know but now I know and so I had to go back to everyone
 I'd sold this thing to her like hey turn that what I'd sold you the legal
 But if we make these shifts and these changes to then it's it falls within the the bounds of like what's like what's okay?
 and so when I shifted those things and but I spent a lot of time studying like and
 Like you know entrepreneurs who go to jail and try to figure out what they did wrong and why they didn't like where
 Where they they pushed the boundaries too far and all those kind of things
 You know I've got probably half a dozen friends
 They've spent a time in jail who were amazing entrepreneurs who just they didn't understand the outer the outer limits of what's what's okay to do
 And not do and sometimes they were they were
 Aware of it sometimes they didn't they weren't aware of it. And so for me. It's like okay
 What are the what are the boundaries like what what should I not be doing?
 And you know I want to make sure that I don't that I don't go to jail and so I have those rules as well
 Right so I have this outer ring of rules that are like all the things will keep me out of jail
 Now this inner ring of rules of all the things that'll keep me out of hell and then in that space between you know
 What are the where the inner ring ends and the outer ring inside of there?
 This is like there's a whole bunch of rules that are like society norms and and the way things are supposed to be done
 All kinds of seven in there. I break all the rules I want and because I don't believe those rules matter right like those are like
 Yeah, and so for me. It's like I look at that and I'm like
 I think it's important to have rule and law and order and things are important
 I think it's it's very good for you guys for all of us including myself to really define okay
 Here are my thou shalt's knots. I will not break these rules under any circumstances
 I want to I want to keep my soul. I want to make sure that I'm a good human being and things like that right?
 I'm not gonna lie cheat still. I'm not gonna be an ethical
 I'm not gonna like all those things that are core right and then the outer rim or all the things that if I were to break
 You don't ever agree with them. I'll go to jail
 I'm not work it's not worth any risk to do that and then in that gray area between is where we get to play
 We can break the rules and be creative and do all sorts of amazing fun things to actually change the world
 It's funny. I was reading Aubrey Marcus's book the other day though in the day
 Which is really good book, but as I'm reading it Aubrey has different belief patterns than me, right?
 And so most people happen if you read that and if you're if you're a rule keeper
 You read some of the stuff and really quickly a lot of you guys get turned off like no
 He's you know like a couple examples like Aubrey
 Has an open relationship so him and his wife they go and have sex with lots of other people and he's totally cool with that
 Right for me. It's like oh like that breaks all of the moral compasses that would make me go to hell
 so instead I just take that and I throw that out my okay, I'm not gonna trust his opinion on dating advice because
 It breaks my moral compass and therefore I don't believe I throw it out right and then like in his book
 He's talking about
 Like for him. He's like the best new tropics in world one is nicotine and he's like don't smoke cigarettes
 Because they're really bad for you, but you should be taking nicotine supplements
 I'm like er that's against my moral compass therefore
 I shall take this piece of knowledge and throw it out the window right and all the things that break my moral compass
 I throw out the window anything I learned is amazing
 It breaks my legal compass. I throw out the window and everything in the middle now we could have fun with right
 So the side of that his book is amazing
 But he does his moral compass is different than mine
 So he breaks things that I don't believe with I don't agree with so if I throw in the baby out with the bathwater
 I just say look
 These are things that I don't align with because they break my thou shall not therefore I throw them out
 But the but in here there's some amazing stuff. I'm learning from him that I can I can actually use right?
 And so for me, I just I don't know I want to show up to you guys because I think a lot of times even in my head until last
 Night like I had broken the world down into two types of people like there's real breakers and the real key person
 I'm like I'm a real breaker, but it's not necessarily true
 I break rules within within the confines of what I'm not willing to do right?
 I'm not willing to lose my soul. I'm not willing to go to jail
 I don't want to go to hell or to jail right like those are my two confines but everything in the middle there
 I'm gonna play I'm gonna move things around and have a lot of fun
 Because because those don't matter to me right
 When you're we're in Amsterdam
 I was telling Dave and Brent and John this story about one of my friends Dave Lecani and
 Dave told me the story he was
 This is back when like there's tons of these computer stores, you know
 And he would like you'd go to all the stores and buy all their liquid like go leftover
 Stuff right like hard drives and computers and monitors and all kind of stuff and maybe tell them story kind of wrong
 But the concepts right so he'd buy all this stuff right and then he'd go to the mall and he'd go in the parking line
 He's big huge Saturday sells on Pronomite crazy and you get people from all around the city to come and he'd see
 You know he'd make who knows fifty sixty thousand dollars in weekends selling all this old computer stuff, right?
 And so he's doing that so again, there's nothing morally wrong
 Nothing legal like legally wrong like he's not gonna go to jail for that
 But he was breaking rules in between so the guy like the cops came said hey you you can't
 Have a like you can't do a store out here like that's you can't do that
 It's why nice that well because it's against the rules and he's like well
 What happens if I break this rule and the cops that I'm gonna have to give you a fine
 He's like well how much is the fine the guy's like hundred fifty dollars a day?
 And he's so Dave's like done give me the fine and so guy gave my hundred fifty dollar day
 You know fine to go and make fifty thousand dollars on the weekend so it's like like that's a rule
 I will break I'm not gonna go to jail or go to hell so I'll break that rule to get done the thing
 I need to get done right so they're like a practical example of this
 and so
 Anyway, I just want to share with you guys because I think that for the rule keepers
 I think if you if a lot of you guys are struggling from success because you're stuck with these are the rules
 This is what's okay and a lot of times creation and entrepreneurship and growth comes from like bending or breaking rules
 So for the rule keepers it's like okay. Let's let's set your moral compass here
 You're now shall not to keep you out of hell. Here's the thou shall not so keep you out of jail
 Set those as the outer and inner limits and in between that space there
 Let's go and create and do and and don't worry about the rules that you may get in trouble for so I may look down on your society
 What I do whatever those things are like be okay with breaking those rules
 But not the ones that are gonna you know get you into into hell or out into jail right and then for the rule breakers
 Who are breaking all sorts of rules like I said a friend who's got a big company who just got shut down
 But I see see last week and it's like they they they were on the outer limits
 They were breaking the these rules and their things I I'm aware of like I assume they were aware
 But there for some reason they were looking at it and they were like oh, you know
 We're big enough we could fight it in court or whatever they they have these things
 But the government don't does not care they don't care if you you know
 I mean like if they want to shut you down they will like they click phones for some reason like I don't like you
 Like I can't do anything about they can shut me down like by snapping their fingers and it is over so
 So it's like I need to be very aware of like what are the outer limits the rules and then try to stay off of those limits as much as I can
 right and so
 For again for the
 For the let's see what sorry
 Yeah, the rule breakers like set like make make some rules
 So make your inner your inner circle rules that are like keeping you out of hell and then your outer circle rules
 Keep you out of jail and then only break the rules in that in that space in between
 And that's where that's where amazing just comes from so I hope that helps you guys a little bit
 and
 And yeah, if you're if you're if you're not aware like what are the laws you know to go read the law books because they're confusing
 But go watch American greed go watch shows like that that talk about
 entrepreneurs who who try things and end up in jail because it's that you start seeing the pattern of like okay
 If I'm selling this kind of thing is a security I have a securities license that is curious and I have a credit investors
 I'm selling I got a friend today. There's pitching me on this whole thing
 I was like dude, that's illegal. It's like no, it's not like no
 It's illegal and he's like and I had explained to him like secure you laws and how they worked and all stuff
 And I still don't think you believe me
 But I do you watch an American greed you not you know
 Studying up stuff like the shirts in the patterns you rise. Okay, that is a brilliant idea
 But that will turn to a Ponzi scheme because of this this and this this is a brilliant idea
 But that's illegal because of this and like a lot of times the brilliant ideas are illegal
 And so you got to be aware of the outer limits and then again the other side is like you need to have a moral compass
 in this industry
 Unfortunately, it's not a thing that people focus on and I see people who
 get into drugs and sex and partying and they
 Stab each other in the back and they will steal from their customers and they will sell things to people that shouldn't be selling things to
 They do all sorts of stuff
 Because of the the almighty dollar that they they worship and for me, it's like it's not it's not worth
 It's not worth it when you get hit by a bus and die and all that money disappears like you'll find out really quick
 It's not it's not worth it. So my question for you guys is what's your moral compass?
 What are your thou shalt nots and you're just gonna be different than mine
 Like I'm I'm very strict on a lot of things right like things that I believe in a lot of comes from my religion and my faith
 And like I don't believe in drinking. I don't believe in doing drugs
 I you know and I don't believe in in in lying cheating or stealing like I believe in doing anything
 It's ethically I believe in treating people right like and so these are my oral comp my moral compass
 I'm not gonna go and break those those rules
 Because they're they're important to me and I believe this what keeps me out of hell
 So keep yourself out of hell and out of jail if you do that you have fun in between
 So hope that helps you guys appreciate y'all
 I'm going into the office to go have a ton of fun in the gray area between those two and
 Breaking some rules changing the changes in lives and having some fun
