 What's up everybody it's Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast it is late at night
 I'm not ready to pull right in my book and
 I just saw a post on Facebook and I made a response and
 because I wanted to make a podcast
 Talking about this concept for you because it could be the reason why some of you guys are failing in this journey
 And so I want to kind of nip it in the buzz quicks I can I'm gonna call this title
 The skeptical frame and how it's gonna keep you from success
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet
 Still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All
 Alright everybody so like I said in intro I'm outside right in the traffic seekers book
 I'm breaking away
 This is fast as possible and everyone's well when I get stuck or tired or whatever I will jump on Facebook
 Whatever just read the comments and it's fun right now. We're in the middle of the one-frontway challenge
 I see everyone's testimonials and feedback and I just thousands of things coming in that are positive
 I see people from the last challenge is completed having success. I see
 Members coming I see people in our two-comical coaching programs like tons of success flowing through
 So I got some normal my feet is filled full of full events was fun to go through and just
 Makes me happy to see the success stories that are they're coming from this movement and it makes me really happy
 And then as I'm scrolling through there's one one post I'm not gonna I'm not gonna read the post but
 but the person who posted it
 As things like day two or day three of the challenge right now and
 She's skeptical about the business model and skeptical about the funnels
 She's got to go about this and that and that like and it's talked about whole thing and she's mad at the affiliate program
 and because
 anyway, just it's just
 It's so funny like and and I heard her
 She's the word skeptical like a dozen times and a bunch of other stuff and I don't really don't post on those kind of things
 I usually just let the community kind of you know have fun with it
 But this one bugged me and it bugged me because
 I know that there's people who are struggling because of this and
 I'll read part of my post
 I'm not gonna read the whole thing because it's not applicable to you guys but the last thing I said
 So number three I would comment on it had a lot of things but it all comes down to you being skeptical
 I've yet to meet a person who is skeptical about any topic ever go on and be successful with that thing
 Those were skeptical about a diet never have success with a diet
 It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy the skeptical frame that you are that you are taking this challenge from will guarantee that you won't have
 Success with it. I suggest you changing your frame or let my team know and we'll give your money back because you're just wasting your time and
 Oh, and then the last thing I said those who walk in faith and believe in the system are the ones who somehow always find success
 and so I want to show because
 There there's this weird thing like it's it's funny
 I have so many people I know in this world that are skeptical about whatever right and it's not just
 It's not my you know things I share but it's comfortable anything right about thinking about weight loss or about
 finances about making money you're about
 Running faster getting stronger like insert anything right and the people who are skeptical have you ever noticed that they're never successful with it
 It never it never serves you to be skeptical
 Like I don't know how to say like I'm I'm probably the least skeptical person in the world
 I just take people and like I believe they're probably they're probably right
 I believe they're probably not talking about and and sometimes it's got me burned
 Maybe two or three times the last I got burned by it, but the majority of the time because I'm not skeptical
 I don't go into a situation like I don't think this is work
 I don't believe it and then like it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I come and saying what if
 But let me just change that frame from from I don't think this is gonna work
 Like what if that worked? What if that was true?
 Then what does that mean? What does that open up?
 Like what are the possibilities if that thing is true and I shift my my mindset?
 I remember going to my very first Tony Robbins events by 12 years ago now
 I remember the I walked in and everyone's jumping around like crazy doing their Tony Robbins thing
 I remember like I'm not doing that. I don't jump. I don't dance. I don't I'm not I'm not playing
 This game, you know with everybody I remember sitting there for a long time
 And I just think I'm not gonna you know and I kind of thought I was skeptical
 And so I was looking at this whole thing through the frame of skepticism and
 As I was sitting there, I was like I'm not getting much value on this look around
 I see everyone else like having these breakthroughs and crying these emotional things. I'm like like
 I don't get this like why are these people like they're all dumb like they're morons, right?
 I'm thinking that they're they're dumb and it realizes like I'm the one that's being done
 I'm the one that's coming into this situation being super skeptical and so I've ever seen I was like five or six hours
 And I thought you know what?
 I'm just gonna change my mind just for a moment and say what if instead of me saying nope nope nope
 What if I just change and said wait, what if what if that's true?
 What if what are you saying is actually true then what like what is that?
 What does that look like and I shifted from from the no to the what if and it it literally changed my life?
 I was able to like be open in a moment as it will learn and grow and I didn't take everything at face value
 There's something I'm like I don't think this one doesn't doesn't drive my belief system
 This one doesn't fit but but I didn't shut down every good thing coming at me because of my skepticism
 I kept it open and because that I got so much value so many gifts that came from that because I
 Got rid of my frame of skepticism and so what I'm encouraging you guys is whatever aspect this is in your life
 I don't care if it's business or marketing yourselves, whatever
 you have the ability to to
 Experience whatever it is you're learning or trying to learn through a frame and so you give a frame of belief saying
 I'm gonna believe this person. I'm buying the product. I'm putting trust into them
 I'm gonna have a I'm gonna I'm gonna believe that what they are saying is true and I'm gonna go into this with with a with a
 frame of belief and
 Then or I'm gonna go into the frame of skepticism and when you do that one way or the other
 It'll change your your response. I guarantee if you go into the frame of skepticism you will not be successful
 I'll give you a million percent guarantee. Okay. I don't care what the topic is if you go on skeptical you will not have success
 So why be skeptical?
 Skepticism is one of the worst qualities anybody could ever have I'd rather get burned once or twice my life but open up this
 You know this huge world of possibilities
 Then be skeptical at everything and because that I never get to to experience the amazing thing that that I that I'm trying
 I'm testing them trying to figure out it's gonna work right and so I just turn out at the edge because I know that
 You know it's a real thing a lot of people are raised very skeptically a parent so we're skeptical
 You have family members of skeptical I want you to look at them for a little bit like they successful they successful
 They successful and think I want to be successful like maybe maybe it's the frame of skepticism
 They have in front of the situation is keeping them from success and they pass it on to me
 So either I can be skeptical to get the same result they got or what if I destroy this frame?
 I smash my skepticism I go with belief and faith and then see what happens I guarantee you could pick any diet off the shelf
 I go to reality in fact
 I saw a whole study one time of like which diet is the best diet and guess what?
 Yeah, when all of a sudden down over like a six-month period time
 Like all diets work pretty much the same the only the only thing that that really mattered is the person stuck to the diet or not
 It doesn't matter if you're keto or you're paleo like whatever it is you pick it as long as you stick with it
 And you're belief in it you're gonna be successful with it. Isn't that crazy?
 And so it's the same thing in all things in life like the frame you enter the situation in will affect if you're successful
 It's not and if you go into the frame of belief and trying and openness and willingness
 You have a shot at being successful you go in with skepticism you have zero chance at success zero not even like a half a percent
 Like you are zero percent chance of success. So why would you even?
 Like all you're doing like the definition of the word damn is to stop something right?
 You're damning yourself from the success you want like you're putting up this huge damn to block you from success
 That's all that skepticism is and it's what you're creating when you do that
 So I just want to share this with you because I want to encourage you guys to break down those frames
 You know whatever aspect you like you're trying to change and you're growing because it will stop you from it becoming who you need to become
 Skepticism does not serve you in any situation
 Now I would say upfront you can be skeptical about like I
 You know like don't jump into every single you know
 I've seen a lot of friends get burned so don't jump into every single thing
 But when you look at something you see the fruits of you see like oh my gosh
 Just think it looks like it works
 I see tons of people having success like you like you look at the fruits of something and when you decide I'm gonna commit
 I'm gonna go this way
 That's that's when your skepticism goes off right? It's kind of like somebody told me when I first got married
 I said you know when you're dating you need you need to um
 Notice every single thing but after you get married you have to become blind everything right like or something
 I can't there's a more eloquent way to say that but you know when you're dating you should be looking every single flaw in your
 Potential partners can try and feel that right person
 But after you find that person boom blinders and everything needs to be perfect if you do that you have a successful marriage because if you have this
 You know the the frame of looking at every single problem with your problem with your with your partner
 You're gonna struggle in marriage
 And so it's the same thing like when you're looking at opportunity like I'm gonna lose weight K
 Look at all the different options look at you know be skeptical at that point until you pick like this is the direction
 I'm gonna go and then you have to smash your skepticism and only lead into that with belief
 Otherwise you're gonna struggle so hope that helps hope that helps somebody who's listening appreciate you guys all for listening
