 With that said let's jump in the theme song and I got something really fun to talk to you about today
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital?
 We're spending money from our own pockets. How do we mark it in a way?
 But let's ask it our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain
 profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so my lesson for you guys today stems off of going to watching my daughter play soccer this weekend
 now my daughter Ellie she's into soccer and she loves it and up to this point she's always been on like the I
 Don't like calling out the league teams, but it's like the the local Boise league, right? So it's like
 Not a super hard league and so for the last couple years the team that played together got better and better at the point
 Now they just thrash everybody and so this year they decided like hey
 we should go up and we should go to a bigger division and and
 So click funnel sponsor them well, I say click funnel is really me
 I don't feel good taking money out of click funnel sponsors, but we sponsored them and
 Now they got these cool jerseys that have click funnels logo on the back
 which is kind of cool and they're playing in this new league and they had their very first game this Saturday and
 They've been working really really hard. They got a really good coach
 They got good people around and they're they're they're practicing hard and the girls are doing just awesome
 And they're trying to figure out like you know this next level like where am I at like am I gonna be good?
 I'm I gonna be bad like what's gonna happen? There's all that fear of like the new thing, right?
 And before we left him or Ellie saying well this let this this leagues way better this team's way better than us
 We're gonna get killed and she was told me that was we're driving to go to the soccer game
 I'm like you can't you can't say that you can't go into a game
 Thinking you're gonna lose or you're gonna lose like that's just how it works like you have to like you can't do that and
 I remember watching as they got out on Saturday started playing
 They did really good at first
 It was the tide game for a long long time and then the other team scored once and then it was like boom boom
 scored a bunch of times in a row and they fought well, but they end up losing at the end but as I was watching them it reminded me of
 This video I used to watch this movie back in my wrestling days
 and it was a VHS tape that I bought that
 That was talking about
 Arguably one of the greatest wrestlers
 And definitely the greatest wrestling coach has ever come out of America and his name's Dan Gable
 Dan Gable if you look at he's like I've talked about him before his podcast
 He's like the Michael Jordan of wrestling right like his name's synonymous with wrestling when you hear who's a great rest of all time
 people say Dan Dan Gable right so Dan's Dan's amazing and
 And as good of a wrestler
 He was he then went on and started coaching Iowa Hawkeyes and they won like I don't know like 20 championships in a row afterwards
 He's like one of the most winningest coaches of all time of any sport and just as good of an athlete as he was he was even a better coach and
 And so this video we used to watch it was him coaching his athletes in a total gable story
 He talked about his only loss he ever had who lost once in high school and then or excuse me lost once in college
 It's very senior year last match he lost and he got so upset
 He started training to for the Olympics and he would work out seven hours a day and he went to the Olympics and
 The Russians specifically said like we're gonna train an athlete just to beat Dan Gable and he went to the Olympics
 And not only did they not beat him not nobody even scored a point on him in the Olympics
 And that's why Dan's like this legend in our in our sport right and then I started
 So it tells that story in the beginning of the movie and so you're excited and then it shows him switching to coaching and then
 What do you do with his athletes?
 And I still remember there's some quotes like we like Tom and Terry brands are these twins who?
 Tom's now the head coach Iowa Hawkeyes now that Gable is retired
 But remember him saying in the video said we used to do stuff to make a billy go puke
 like that's how tough Gable's practices were and
 And they show the practice they talk about everything and they talked about the mentality like the mindset and the
 mentality and all things you have to have there's just one quote that I remember I didn't get when I was a teenager
 I used to watch this all the time and Gable said I would never lend athlete step on the mat unless he knew he was gonna win
 And I remember thinking I'm like but what if you lose this like you know and and I didn't get it at the time
 But I used to watch that like literally at least once a week
 We'd watch that sometimes multiple times a week because it gets all motivated and pumped up for wrestling and for our tournaments
 So we always watch ahead of time me and my wrestling buddies and every single time that line would come up
 It would stick in my head. I was like I didn't quite get it. He said I would never let an athlete step on the mat for me
 unless he knew he was gonna win and
 and
 as I got through you know my later years in high school and started competing at the college level I
 Start understanding that it was interesting cuz I
 And I'm sure if anyone's done sports before he probably had this before but like for example one of my one of my best friends
 My favorite people we would wrestle together wrestling practice and I had some weird mental thing where I just
 Am in my head subconsciously I thought he was better than me
 And so every time we'd wrestle he'd beat me and not like a close match like he'd beat me like I was a little girl
 Who would never wrestle before like it was it was it was bad and then me and we go to a tournament together
 We're the same way class and like I would win the tournament and he'd take like fifth right or we go to this tournament and like he would
 He would lose to somebody by five points. I wrestled that same person
 I would tech fall and which means I win by more than 15 points
 They saw them after early and it was like but for some reason like every time I step on the net on the mat with this one guy
 My friend in my head. I didn't think I was gonna win and so I would lose it was so frustrating and so like
 Just drove me crazy. I'm like I'm I beat all the people you lose to
 But I can't beat you what's going on and that's when I started like hearing this message in my head from back from watching this
 Gable video of just like I you know, I've never let a wrestler step on the mat unless he knew he was gonna win
 before he stepped out on the mat and
 I started thinking that with my daughter like she stepped out on the field and she did not know she was gonna win
 In fact, she thought, you know, I'm probably gonna lose and so they went out there and then they lost and
 I thought about how that like how many times in life that
 That that message applies right and obviously for the context of this
 This podcast it has to do with your business right like how many times do we get into business right?
 I hope I'm gonna succeed. I hope this is gonna work. I hope I hope right
 Now that's the quilven to me stepping on the mat saying I hope I can beat this guy
 Which means I don't I don't know if I'm gonna win or not, but I hope I can right
 Take that's the mentality that I that you're stepping on the mat
 And if you if you do that most of the time at least the majority of time you're gonna lose because you're hoping you can win
 Dan Gable said they said I don't let any athletes step on the mat unless they know they're gonna win and they may not win
 But they must step on the mat knowing that they're gonna win right?
 I step into a business. I hope and be successful
 I step in knowing I'm gonna be successful knowing I'm gonna win knowing that no matter what happens no matter what the what the trials the
 problems the the ups the downs the sleepless nights things like like I know I'm gonna win because if you go into like hoping you're gonna win
 When those things pop up the trials like I knew I wasn't you know
 I was I hoped I was gonna be successful, but I kind of knew it wasn't in the back of my mind
 I knew it wasn't gonna be successful right?
 You know like you let yourself off the hook if you're hoping it's gonna be successful
 You can't go into something having hope and thinking like I hope I'm gonna win and especially going in thinking like I may lose
 Right you've got to go in believing a hundred million percent that like I'm gonna be successful
 I'm gonna win like I'm stepping on this mat. I'm gonna beat that person. I know I can beat him
 Okay, otherwise Dan Gable wouldn't even let you get on the mat. He would look at you and be like nope
 You like I'm not like you have a doubt in your mind. I can see it therefore
 I'm not gonna let you compete for me
 I'd rather lose this match like have a forfeit than let you step on the mat not knowing you're gonna win
 And that's the kind of mindset he demanded out of his athletes
 And that's why they won the 20 whatever NCAA championships in a row because he'd never let an athlete step on the mat
 List they knew they were gonna win
 So for you as your coach in this marketing sphere in this business realm
 I want to make sure that you guys had go in with the same thing like don't step into a business unless you know you're gonna be
 Successful if you don't know you're gonna be successful
 It means you got to step back and spend some time on yourself on personal development and understanding yourself and your own skills
 That believing in yourself enough you can go out there and have success
 Otherwise, it's gonna become it's difficult like if I didn't know I was gonna be successful every single
 Walking into the clique of pedals office if I was scared if I had fear and anxiety all these things and and a lot of things
 Things aren't there like there are times I'm definitely scared or nervous or excited or like all those things
 But I know when I step out on the mat. I'm gonna be successful right at 10x growth con I stepped on the mat
 I knew I was gonna be successful. Okay, and you've watched the first one we did I made 3.2 million in 99 second when I failed
 Okay, I've fell flat on my face, but regardless when I stepped on I stepped on that stage
 I knew I was gonna be successful. It's anything a fun hacking life. Same thing
 I speak other places same thing I'm selling on a webinar like I don't go into that like hoping it's gonna be successful
 I go in knowing I'm gonna be successful
 And that's the mindset you've got to have and so if you don't have that mindset yet now and might be the thing that's holding you back
 Okay, you're hoping you'll be successful because you're hoping you're you're you're willing and able to let yourself off the hook
 And that's why you're not hitting the goals and the things you want
 so
 That is my my message for you guys today is it for you to go out there into and
 Again, use this as for business. Use it as a metaphor for all aspects of your life, right?
 There's the girl you want to ask out on a date if there's the the the
 Business venture you want to the partnership you want to do if there's the the the relationship
 You know, whatever that that thing is you got to step into that having absolute confidence absolute certainty
 Knowing that when you step on the mat, you're gonna win and if you do that
 Your likelihood of winning will go up. Okay. It's it's the weirdest thing
 And you know me losing to my buddy over and over and over again because I had this the seed of doubt in my mind
 I'm like man. He always beats me
 Let alone the fact I beat all the people he loses to because I had this belief that he was gonna beat me
 He beat me
 And it was just that it was a belief and it's something that you can shift you can change
 And I wish I would have understood that in a deeper level back then but I understand it now
 And I want you guys to understand it now because it'll make your jobs your business your growth your relationship
 Whatever you're looking for so much better when you go into with absolute certainty knowing that you're gonna win
 Um, and that's my message for today
