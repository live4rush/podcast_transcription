 What's up everybody, this is Russell Brunson.
 Welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast.
 During today's episode, we talk about funnel hacking live.
 I recorded the first episode talking about day zero and I got so much good feedback and
 more people want to know behind the scenes, what else is happening, the ups, the downs,
 the chaos, the excitement, what they missed out on, what they didn't see behind the scenes
 and a whole bunch more.
 So today I'm going to be diving into day number one, funnel hacking live.
 So I told you guys about day zero, right?
 The day I came today, all this stuff that happened there, how great it was.
 And you know, that night it went to bed super late, started working on my presentation because
 the next day, day number one, I was leading the event with a presentation I've been thinking
 about for like two years.
 And one I was excited for and nervous for and one that I didn't want it to be like a super
 like heady presentation, right?
 I wanted it to be something that's very heartfelt and like, which you know, a lot of times I'm
 teaching tactically, you know, a lot of slides, several months, two, so three, I was like,
 I want to do something that's, ah, that's different, that's going to help set the identity
 for the room, help get people the, like the minds of the belief that things are going to
 need to be successful for the rest of the week.
 And so that night I was working on it, trying to figure this out and it was, you know, one
 of those things was just nerves and anxiety, and stress and excitement and all the things
 wrapped up to it.
 And then finally passed that one to bed and it was cool about fun acting live, it was
 day number one, we don't start till lunchtime, which gives me the morning to plan and prepare,
 which is so nice.
 If you do a big event, starting day one at like nine a.m. is so stressful and hard, plus
 there's still people flying in and registration and so we started starting day number one,
 kind of like again, lunchtime and it's so nice.
 So the morning I had a chance to wake up to like relax a little bit, kind of focus on
 some things, keep working my presentation, you know, getting my, you know, first day,
 at least for me, is like, I'm the most nervous and excited and so I've got to go and get
 all, you know, my, get my clothes, make sure they're working, all that stuff happens.
 And so I had the morning to kind of do all those kind of things.
 And I gave you any text updates to my team throughout the, throughout the morning, like
 how many were registered, right?
 Because the night before people registered, I think we had two or three thousand, they
 pre-read or they'd registered night before.
 So based on that, we knew, you know, how many people were, should be registering based on,
 you know, years past kind of what the numbers end up being.
 And so it was nice to be able to, to get those texts on the day, just knowing, okay,
 there's people here, they're in the hotel, they're going to show up because my biggest
 fear is doing an event and coming there and not having people be there.
 And the reason that's my biggest fear is because it's actually happened to me twice.
 Once was, we did an event in Salt Lake City, this is probably 15 years ago now, crazy.
 Anyway, we had 300 people that registered for the event, they had paid to buy a ticket,
 so I was like, oh, we have 300 people.
 So we set up 300 people and when we got there, we opened the doors, there was about 100 that
 actually showed up, which means the room's like sparse and empty and it's just like,
 ah, like, ah, not a good feeling at all, right?
 And then a couple years later, I was in a company called Riplin, we did our first intro
 event and there were like 1200 people at it and then we launched the company and we
 had like 1.6 million people registered for this app and then we didn't event on the back
 side of it.
 So we did the room, I think we had the room set by 2,000 seats, we had 1.6 million people
 registered, this is going to be easy to fill up and I remember getting there and we, like,
 five minutes we're open door, we looked outside and we're like, there's not 2,000 people here.
 There's close to 300, I remember Brian, who was his company, he messaged me, we ran back
 and so we spent 15 minutes pulling chairs out of the room just because like, we're going
 to be people there, right?
 So we're pulling all chairs out of the room, we got like 500 chairs in the room, they open
 the doors and there's this huge empty event room all the way up to where, you know, people
 run in and sit down and it's just like, oh, it's so painful and hard and embarrassing
 for me, like, it's just one of those things, right?
 And so I've always, every year had fear of our events, especially year number one was
 the worst, right?
 We were in Vegas, I had been in the event since the two they'd crashed, I was like, I'll
 never do the event again, but you funnel hackers talk to me to do in one and I just
 remember like, yeah, just the, the fear I have every year is like looking out and like,
 okay, people are here.
 And so for me, you guys getting those texts like columns and all, okay, no people in the
 in the hotel, they're here, they're registered, some amazing is going to happen, right?
 And so anyway, that kind of led up and then, you know, finally it's like, okay, I send my
 intro slides down, we have our bodyguards that follow us, you know, we follow us down
 and had some of my kids there this year too with us, so, you know, bodyguard, it takes
 us all back, back hallways, it gets down to the room, we walk in and walk in the room,
 you see like, how amazing the room is and you can hear people outside, you hear all the
 the emotion and things happening and I was like to peek out the doors and people were
 crazy screaming and it's like, oh my gosh, this is happening again.
 And then we had something really fun, I think I mentioned it a little bit during the podcast
 talking about day number zero, but Justin Benton, who's one of my inner circle members,
 had acquired for me Napoleon Hill's actual typewriter and the outwitting the devil the
 actual manuscript, which are two priceless heirlooms, right?
 It's like just like some of the coolest things ever, right?
 Some of you know I'm building a library slash museum, so like these will be in the library
 museum, in fact this is kind of cool.
 Dan Kennedy told me the other day that he bought a new fax machine and so I was like,
 can I have an old fax machine, he's like, well it's not dead yet, I'm like, okay, why
 I have no point in Hill's typewriter, I would also like to have Dan Kennedy's fax machine
 in the library someday, like, how cool would that be?
 So anyway, so Dan told me the one that dies, I get first dibs on it, so that's gonna be
 amazing.
 So like we're about to open the doors and all of a sudden Justin Benton, like, messaged
 her, tack hammer, he's like, I'm here, I got the stuff, so he ran in and I got a hold
 of the manuscript, I saw it and put it down and then the typewriter's in this huge box
 and so we like unboxed it, there's like those foam peanuts falling everywhere and like
 pulling it out and like, this is crazy and the here, the people of doors banging like
 ready to come in and we're like, we need open doors, open doors, like, ah, so I put
 the typewriter up, put the manuscript, we found a tablecloth to hide him and kind of
 cover him because my intro presentation that's so excited for was called the Drifter versus
 the Driven and I think you probably heard it, we played this podcast, I had my brother
 turn it into a podcast, you guys probably had a chance to hear it here.
 We also streamed that first presentation on Facebook's like, it's a sob but I talked
 about Napoleon Hill and about how we ended up with a book and how out, you know, we didn't
 devil talks about drifters versus non drifters and for me I was like, I never connected with
 non drifter but I do connect with them driven so they drift over to the driven and the
 like, all this kind of stuff and so, anyways, crazy.
 So then we opened the doors, my kids were there on stage watching, we see people like
 running in, jumping over each other and the chaos that always ensues when you have the
 fun of hacking live, it's like a normal event where people slowly walk in, it's chaos and
 anyway, so it was fun watching it all happen and then we went backstage and Devon comes
 out and does the intro while getting nervous and then my name happens and we had a wall
 this year in the wall instead of like opening, the past year where the wall, you know, it
 breaks down and it opens, this year the wall went up and so standing behind the wall, all
 the smokes coming out, it's going crazy and I said boom, it starts raising and yes, we're
 because the light breaks from under the bottom of the thing and it, you know, because of
 it's your feet and then it's your knees and then it's your chest but you can't see it
 yet because your eyes are being covered by the wall and it gets a little higher, a little
 higher and all of a sudden like it passes your eyes and boom, you see the smoke, the
 lasers, the Devon clapping, you see the entire audience going nuts, you hear the music, everything
 and you're like, oh, like it is the craziest, you know, I explain it like, it's like all
 the nerves, excitement, all things happening and all of a sudden boom, it happens and then
 you step out into that and you just absorb it and it's just like the coolest man, it's
 just a cool feeling and so that's how the day began, it's crazy like, oh so much extra
 anxiety, all things that went out there and I know I'm in the little nervous eye, I watched
 the presentation later, I love the presentation but also my first time giving it, I was nervous,
 I didn't have to have a slide, it was more me trying to doodle and draw and like explain
 these concepts and so if you heard, I was like, I did sound nervous but at the same
 time I felt like it landed, like it was the right message was right, identity giver, really
 like beginning, I had so many friends messaging people at home, people here who were like in
 tears like that was the thing I needed, like I've become a drifter, I was focused, I was
 driven and I fell off the path and I'm back, I'm going to do the things and it set the
 tone that I wanted to set and it became the theme of the event, right, like the drifters
 versus the driven, like we are the driven, like we're here to drive and to push and to
 change our lives and the people's lives we've been called to serve, so that was the intro
 event and like after that I could have gone home and it would have been amazing but then
 we had like day one life, I wish I make day one like if you go to day one you're just
 like day, that was day one, this is amazing, so I thought we broke a CEO from the Life
 Coach School, Brooke came out and if you know Brooke she's one of the most successful info
 product businesses I know, she's got two products, one funnel and does multiple eight
 figures a year, it's amazing and she does it all by teaching one framework and so I had
 her come and like teach the framework, like here's the framework I use which teaches people
 how to become like, she teaches people how to use her framework to be a life coach, like
 how to coach herself and then she also said and here's how I took this framework and built
 it into this huge multi multi multi eight figure your business, that's how many multis, you
 can do them after your head but her is amazing, she was so much fun and her energy like all
 the things and like, she did such a great job, it was fun because like my mom's back
 like I love Brooke she's so much fun like my mom doesn't have nothing about what we're
 doing, she's loved her energy and Brooke's session was insane, it was so cool and then
 I think we gave her more time and she was planning on so she'd Q&A at the end and she
 was working with people in the audience, it was really cool, it was special, so Brooke
 came and it was cool, you could see why she's so successful, you can see why people love
 her, she was amazing, so one thing to know about Brooke, it was like the most impressive
 to me, she's probably of all the speakers and the people that are there, probably the
 person who makes the most amount of money, at least up there, like one of the most successful
 people in the room and then it's funny because like other people will come and then you're
 backstage talking and they're wandering the halls and stuff like Brooke was on the front
 road the entire event all four days, she was taking notes, she was like watching the process
 studying, doing all sorts of stuff, engaged and everything and then when I made a coaching
 offer she set up for $250,000 coaching program, like everyone else was like oh I wanted to
 comic club, I'm too good for coaching, oh I'm too good and it's like she wanted to
 comic club every 30 minutes and she's still there front row, paying attention, taking
 notes, doing the things and then goes and joins the coaching program on top of that,
 and in fact right now we're doing the one final way challenge this week and she's here
 in Boise, like in the audience, like experiencing just to like to learn and to like, anyway
 she's an impressive human, like just super impressed with her and like she killed it,
 which was awesome and then after Brooke spoke this was one that was like magic for me, so
 in basketball you got Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, right, in wrestling there's Dan Gable
 was the Michael Jordan and the person nowadays is Jordan Burroughs, Jordan was in Serbia
 wrestling at the world tournament, he won the world title which means he won the seventh
 world title which is Bates in the the go, the greatest wrestler of all time, greatest
 American wrestler, John Smith was the old greatest wrestler, he won six world Olympic
 titles and Jordan broke his record, three days before fun hockey live, flew from Serbia
 with his family after he won the medal, directly to fun hockey, hadn't gone home yet and shows
 up and I got a chance to meet the night before during sound checks, but this is my guy, like
 this is if I could like, anyway he's my hero and so it's so cool to be able to have a platform
 where he could come directly after becoming the greatest wrestler of all time and come
 on stage and he told me like, well you don't tell people that I won, so I'm like, I wanted
 to, I wanted everyone to understand like the magnitude of who he is and what he accomplished
 and all kind of stuff, but he asked me not to, so I didn't, which was cool because his presentation
 he told the whole story and the end of it, like the buildup and the deposits and stuff
 that didn't work and the frustrations just point him back and forth and back and forth
 and the end of it he showed the match that he just won three days earlier and showed
 how he won and became the greatest wrestler of all time and people went crazy and he's
 someone who's never done public speaking before, he speaks short form things, he's
 on podcast, he does stuff out in the wrestling community, he's never had a chance to be on
 stage and he'd never seen something like fun hockey live and he went out and experienced
 it and it was amazing, his presentation was, it was flawless, it was so good and so, yeah
 even if you didn't know anything about wrestling and care about wrestling that you left that
 presentation moved and changed, it was insane, I can't even, I could talk for days about
 just that experience from being back stage, him and his wife and his kids and watching
 his dad on thing and then afterwards he brought his kids on stage, his wife on stage which
 was cool, one really interesting thing, we had these metal key cards for all the staff
 right and they could have and so one of Jordan's sons was like, I want those key cards and
 so Jenny gave, Jenny my assistant gave him the key card and the key card was silver and
 he's like, I don't want that one, I want that one, he pointed something at Goldwood,
 he's like, why, it's the same thing, he's like, we don't wear silver in our family,
 always see his gold, which is, that's Jordan's, his Instagram handle is always see his gold
 and it was so cool because like, his little kids have been trying to like, we don't like
 silver, we only like gold and so we went down to the gold key card and he came out on his
 neck because they only wear gold in that family, which is so cool and like, just anyway,
 there's only magical moments there, they're awesome and I was able to pull a few wrestlers
 that I knew behind the scenes, like to get pictures with them and stuff but Jordan's
 just a classic, I gave me some signed Jordan Burrough shoes afterwards which was amazing
 which will be hanging up in my wrestling room, my house very very soon and that was,
 yeah, I mean that was the first three presentations, Drifter vs. Driven, oh we had Todd, I forget
 Todd came out, we talked about ClickFunnels 2.0 and then from there Brooke Castillo and
 Jordan Burroughs, I'm like, how do you make this day any better, it's crazy and then
 we did, after that, Daryl Eaves came out and if you don't know Daryl Eaves, he is the
 greatest YouTube mind on the planet, he is business partners with Mr. Beast who is the
 biggest YouTube channel but Daryl is the genius who understands the algorithm.
 Daryl also started a mass movement you may have heard with the TV show he created called
 The Chosen, which is the greatest documentary series, whatever it is about the life of Christ
 and it's, he created it in a way because he wanted to make Christ relatable to the world
 and it is this movement that I think he said did it at $100 million just in T-shirt sales
 alone, just craziness but it's this, yeah he did it using YouTube and using things to
 build this huge mass movement so he talked about how to use YouTube and how to use the
 algorithm and how he did it to build Mr. Beast's business and how he did it to launch the
 Chosen and he showed Myron Galtme help Myron's YouTube channel blew up and just, man, that
 was one of the most tactical like, like, Daryl is amazing and yeah, like that was insane
 too, like, it's just like how do we, how, anyway, day one was crazy and by the way,
 when I'm done yet, so after Daryl came and showed his stuff and he gave everyone's blown
 away, I was blown away, everyone was just freaking out, then Stu McLaren came on and
 Stu shared nine different funnels that you can use to launch a membership site in like
 30 minutes, he was like boom, boom, rapid fire and all of them were just like crazy,
 Todd's after taking notes, like ooh, if we had this click from Super Mario we can do
 that one, if we had this we can do that so like watching Todd brainstorm while it's
 Stu's training and teaching was really, really cool and so that happened and after Stu got
 done sharing all his membership, had a launch membership funnels, then we went from there
 and then we, oh, Stu and his wife Amy came on stage and if you know, every time you build
 a funnel site, click phones goes live, we donated a dollar towards Villagint Impact,
 which Stu and Amy's chaired it and so we had a chance to bring them on stage, give them
 a huge chat for like $150 something thousand dollars, which is really, really cool and
 then you think that was a good day, but wait, we're just getting started, it keeps on going.
 After that we broke into breakout rooms and we had four of them break out rooms this year,
 all theme and topic based, one of them was Stephanie Blake, she ran a whole room talking
 about agencies like how to run it and how to run and build your own agency as a funnel
 builder and her group was amazing, she messaged me afterwards and you probably hear I talk
 about all the time, how like how funnel hackers are 1% crazy and she's like, I think she said
 interbox, I told her they were the point 5% crazy, who served the 1% crazy and it was
 anyway, she's just amazing and her session, it was packed, all the people wanted to build
 agencies, start an agency, things like that, Stephanie came and delivered, spent an hour
 with them in that breakout room and it was amazing, feedback, so good.
 Number two was Dave Lindenbaum, he ran the second breakout room and Dave is an e-commerce
 expert, he does coaching, he's out of our coaching group, he helps me manage my e-commerce
 companies, but he also in fact they had like a kombucha making kit company and a candle
 making kit and Tabasco making kit and he just is amazing at e-commerce, he's also like one
 of the most brilliant, no time I said this could have go to his head, but one of the
 brilliant marketing minds ever, he'll look at something, he'll have like the craziest
 ideas for split tests in tweaks and things like that and it's always like just pure
 goal, like he's brilliant, so Dave's there, Anthony Morrison ran a breakout room on webinars,
 Anthony's got a really cool software called webinar fuel, so he went and taught people
 all the biggest things to increase webinars, make more sales, he's like that which was
 amazing and then Preston Lauren Anderson, they built a whole info product business teaching
 people how to make cookies, they hit two comic club I believe with like a $37 info product
 with no upsells or downsells or anything and like they're amazing and so they showed how
 you can take any passion including how to make cookies and build into a huge empire
 do what they did and so their story was so cool as well and they, yeah like those breakout
 rooms are awesome as we had, if you want to run an agency one group, if you want to
 run a physical product another group, if you want to run webinars another group and if
 you want to sell information products and yeah everyone did, the breakout groups are
 awesome, I didn't have a chance to send all of them, I kind of popped in and out of
 each one of them but my goal is we just go back to and listen to all of the trainings
 because I just heard nothing but amazing this from all of them and then you think the day
 was over but wait there's more, after we got back to the breakout rooms then Mr. Dan
 Kennedy came back out and I had a chance to interview him for two more hours on magnetic
 story selling which is tied to the book that me and him just put out, it's a high ticket
 book so the people who were at the event who donated charity got it, we'll be selling
 in the future for I don't know thousand bucks or something but we did a whole session and
 presentation around that and it was really really cool, I think I was tired at that point
 I think Dan was tired, it had been a long day but at the same time like you know every
 time Dan opens his mouth gold falls out so he had a chance to listen to Dan and it was
 amazing so I know I was done, I went to our room and I passed out and that was day number
 one so between day zero, day number one as you can see Funnel Hockey Live is crazy and
 amazing and intense and all the things but I want to shout out to you guys for getting
 folks who were there, hopefully rekindles some of the thoughts and memories of those
 who weren't to kind of give you guys behind the scenes of what happens and like what's
 like why I pick the speakers I do and why we work shooting the things that you learn
 at a Funnel Hockey Live event, if you haven't come in the past make sure you come next
 to your next year's going to be whatever you're right, how do we make this better than last
 year?
 I'm not sure how to do it but I promise you we will so do not miss it but that's it, I
 hope you guys enjoyed this episode, Funnel Hockey Live day number one, I will have an episode
 of day two, three and four coming out here in the near future as well, that's what I
 think you guys much and we'll talk to you soon, bye everybody.
