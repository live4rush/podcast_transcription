 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing seekers podcast today
 I'm gonna help you guys to actually do some hard things
 So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, all right, I'm head to the office today
 I'm so excited this is first day and like five days I have a chance to actually go and
 Move forward on plans for world domination because it's been weekends and holidays and school things and today
 I get to actually work. We also have two common club X program here
 so we got about 250 entrepreneurs here in Boise working on getting to their million dollar funnel, which is exciting and
 It's exciting everything just everything's amazing
 But today I want to talk to you about something that I think we are not talking enough about
 I was a church on Sunday and what's crazy is so I grew up in Utah and
 when I was when I was in
 In Utah my high school wrestling coach. His name is coach Lee Leslie
 football coach, sorry and
 I wasn't that good a football I'm not gonna lie
 But anyway, it was really great coach and then after I or I think a year after high school graduated
 He left apparently and I didn't see him for like 20 years
 And then I moved to Boise Idaho and then I move around and finally we'd my new home
 And I go to church the first day and guess who's in my ward?
 The Mormons we call our church's wards. So in my ward in my church and I'm sitting there
 And I hear this guy talk and this is voice from the past. I was like wait a minute. Is that coach Leslie? I'm like
 And I'm like dude you have no idea who I am but you were my rep my football coach in high school
 How crazy it's so kind of reconnected and now it's a jake who's amazing designer works for us
 And it's just really really cool, but anyway, he was he's actually moving away and
 Sunday he had chance to speak and then now they're basically moving to a different
 different area and
 Anyway, he spoke at church was really really cool, which that could be a whole topic for another day, but
 afterwards in one of the classes they asked the question like if you were gonna die what what feedback would you leave your kids and
 What coach Leslie said that was so cool. He said it is
 Masculine manly voice. He was like I would tell my kids to do hard things and that was it
 And I was like huh I start thinking I was like most of us like
 We just don't do hard things anymore
 Especially our kids and our you know like I'm afraid for our kids kids like we just don't do hard things anymore
 And it's like if you really want to become amazing what you do you have to do hard things
 It'd be okay with that and I was thinking like why do we have to do hard things and it all comes down to this word
 Which is like the coolest word ever for at least for today and the word is capacity
 Like when you do hard things it increases your personal capacity to be able to do harder things
 And then you do harder things and it increases your capacity to even harder things and you and you keep going through this process
 Right like I can't think I'm back like if I would have started click funnels
 Let's say I met Todd when we were both like 11 years old
 Back in the day and we would launch click funnels. It would have been a colossal failure
 Right because we hadn't done hard things our capacity was not up to snuff like we wouldn't have been able to handle the load of what's come
 Like I got no everyone's like oh click funnels is so fun and amazing and nice and it is and it's amazing
 But I can't tell you the stress and the pressure and the things that come down upon us almost on a daily basis
 That we have to figure out and it's hard and we do hard things and it increases our capacity and prepares us for the next thing
 And so we can do hard things so we can increase our capacity from the next hard things
 We keep moving forward and eventually take over the entire world
 Which is the goal in the game plan and yeah people right what's your three-year goal might take over the world?
 Come on now like what's yours? Anyway, so I want to share this because you I mean we know this is true right like you see it in
 in aspects of life like if you want to lift weights and
 And increase your capacity with weights you do hard things you tear the muscles down your muscles build up right and then you want to get stronger
 So you do hard things you tear the muscles they build up stronger
 But the same is true in all aspects of life
 You want to be amazing if you want to change the world if you want to grow a company if you want to sell products
 If you want to be famous if you want to be an athlete a super star
 Whatever it is you have to become really really really really good and comfortable at doing really really hard things and being okay with it
 And so my message for you guys today is just simple
 Okay with those things that you look at you like I don't want to do that's gonna be hard
 It's gonna be tired. I'm already tired. I don't want to do that
 All those things come out of our face you guys stop and say you know what I'm gonna do hard things
 I'm gonna go and I'm just gonna take this thing on and I don't know how I'm gonna do
 It's gonna be painful and I'm not not fun necessarily
 But I'm gonna do hard things and then you do it and then guess what happens
 You figure out way to do it and increases your capacity when your capacity capacity increases
 Then you do the next thing and then you figure it out and increase your capacity keep doing that day in and day out
 Week in and week out month in a month out year in year out guess what happens?
 Okay in a year two years five years ten years from now
 You will be amazed at what you've been able to accomplish and we've been able to do
 I look back now like my challenges from ten years ago
 I'm like dude how such a was like I was whining about this thing that really nowadays
 I could do it, you know juggling backwards on my head upside down
 I could be super easy because my capacity has gotten to a point where I can actually handle it right and
 And so it's true for you guys too if you want over the next year ten years decade
 You know whatever it is if your life to really accomplish what you do is you want to accomplish it to become good at doing hard things now
 Because the only way to increase your capacity so you can be prepared to the next hard thing
 So you can increase your capacity so you can be prepared for the next hard thing and everything in life is a progression
 Right, it's like walking up a flight of stairs and get closer and closer and closer to your mission to your goal
 Whatever it is you're trying to do and it all comes down to doing hard things
 Which will increase your capacity which then you can do more hard things and keep going through the cycle again
 I was thinking a lot this week about Tony Robbins. He said something that most people
 They they overestimate what they can do in a year and they underestimate what they can do in a decade
 I started thinking like I think a lot of us that way like okay
 I gotta be but like we have these big goals for what do the next year and it's like look chillax on the whole year goal like like
 Let it come work hard came before but like don't stress about like the year goal
 But if you but if you're doing what I'm talking about and you're like doing hard things
 You're stretching your capacity and you're consistently doing it over a decade you'd be shocked at what's possible
 Okay, I mean click funnels now
 It's like and we're not even three years old or you know, or excuse me
 We're a little over three years old not even four years old yet
 And I look at like what's been happening, you know and from the time we started so probably five years
 So we're half a decade and half a decade from idea to where we are today
 We've built this huge company and we've changed, you know thousands of people's lives around the world and I guess it's it's fascinating
 means to happen
 but if I would have been like, you know, my year go I'm looking at my year goal because we're because we're spending all this time developing this weird thing called click funnels and
 And you know, we're losing all of our money and I had to fire all these people and make all the stress that came around
 At ahead of time we never would have got here, right?
 But we did hard things increase our capacity got better did some more hard things increase our capacity got better to eventually boom out pops click funnels
 And then boom out pops the next thing and the next thing and the next thing, you know
 I'm grateful to click funnels didn't start with 65,000 members or I probably would have crushed personally under the pressure of it
 I'm sure the Todd would have and Ryan all of our team like we wouldn't be able to handle it because our capacity wasn't ready
 Okay, but we were able to grow with it. That's the nice thing about having kids like everyone stressed out about having kids like
 It's gonna be so hard. Like the good news is when the kids come out they sleep most the time
 So like you don't have to be amazing. Okay, but as the kids get bigger you increase your capacity
 You get a little better at it and eventually by the time they're walking and totalling you you can keep up with them
 Right and the time they're teenagers you'll keep up with them because we're growing with them
 We're doing hard things with them and we're increasing capacity. So I want you to think about this
 Okay, the mission that you have in life the goal the reason why you're here on this planet
 I guess is right now you are not ready for it
 You could not handle the strain of the capacity would take for you to actually be successful in that thing today
 Okay, and so for some of you guys like I'll screw that and I'm gonna try I'm gonna go back and watch cartoons, right?
 I understand that but instead like okay
 I have to figure out how to increase my capacity so that someday
 I will be worthy and able to handle this mission that God or the universe or whatever you want to call it
 It's gonna give you and you got to be prepared for that right?
 And so the way you get prepared for that right now, which you do hard things
 So my question fuse. What's the hard thing that you're looking at right now?
 They're like I don't know if I can or if I should do that it's gonna be so hard
 Mmm, right what is that thing? Let's go and do it
 Let's freakin just tackle it head on and destroy that thing and own it look at that thing like dude
 I own you and then go and dominate it. So there you go you guys
 Today is the day to do some hard work. Okay, coach Leslie told me if he could give us kids one piece of advice
 It would be do hard things and so for you your message for today is do hard things
 And I know a reason why because if you're gonna prepare yourself for the mission that's eventually gonna come to you
 You got to do hard things today to be ready for it
 There's a quote I'm a slaughter because I don't have to go on top of my head, but Winston Churchill said
 There comes a time in every man's life when he'll be figured to be tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do something
 You need to him into his talents and his abilities
 What a tragedy that moment finds him unprepared or unqualified for that work which could have been his finest hour now
 Is the time you guys start preparing you do that by?
 Doing hard things with that said appreciate you guys all have an amazing day today, and I will talk to you all soon. Bye everybody
