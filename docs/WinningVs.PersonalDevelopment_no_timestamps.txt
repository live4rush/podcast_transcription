 Hey, everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast. I hope you guys are having an amazing day
 I had a fascinating conversation with somebody who was at the top of their game yesterday
 And I got a couple insights from it. They were so interesting. I want to share with you guys here today
 So that said let's queue up the theme song we get back
 I'm gonna share to you guys some really cool insights about developing your team and developing yourself
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own
 pockets
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right everybody welcome back
 Okay, so Sunday
 most of you know at this point if you don't I am a Mormon we call ourselves members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and
 in
 In my church
 I have a calling where I get to interview people and and check in with them
 And so on Sunday after church I had interviews with a bunch of people and some interview in them all and it was really fun
 He had no no
 much people go to church thus kind of a different level and then the last interview I had is with this guy and
 We were about to start the interview and we started talking about
 Soccer he's a soccer coach. He's a soccer coach here at the high school
 but he's also like
 runs the soccer organization here Idaho and he's also one of the main guys in the national level and
 We start talking about what he's doing. He's like you know
 Every weekend he's flying to New York and find his replaces for soccer and on top of that. He's a doctor
 So he's also doing his you know his business and these doing soccer stuff because he's he's super passionate about it
 Anyway, but it was really fascinating. We were talking about
 about soccer and wrestling and just different things about different sports and he started telling me that what they're what he's trying to do right now is
 to adopt a lot of what
 other countries do
 In soccer here in America and it was interesting he told me about and I didn't know this
 We talked about in in other countries outside of America with soccer program works
 Which by the way said soccer is the number one biggest sport in the world
 I didn't know that either so there you go another interesting fact for you guys today, but what he said was interesting
 he said that um
 he said that in other countries let's say you are a
 Little league coach
 I don't know what they call them soccer
 But like you're coach for kids team right and you you are
 You get a team and you find some of his talent
 And if you are the person who discovers that person so the way that organization structures if you find the person then you
 You help develop them at a certain level and you move them up next level
 Say hey
 This guy's a rock star and you put him on the next higher level team
 And then if he gets if that person is really good there and they get up next level next level all the way to the professionals
 And then eventually they become professionals and then they go from team to team and they get sold the long way right
 I think the basketball like if you you know if you're traded in the NBA from the Chicago Bulls you touch jazz
 You get paid, you know, whatever 20 million bucks to be transferred over to this team and you know you knew you knew player contract
 Basically what happens in soccer is interesting. He said that
 And he was telling me the name of some soccer player that I probably should know but I had never heard the person's name before
 he's like recently he just got he got traded from this team to this team and
 The cost to trade him was 70 million dollars and I was like, oh my gosh
 That's crazy said but what's interesting he said that the way it's structured in soccer is that 70 million dollar contract?
 They they've moved him over and you know the player will get whatever that whatever his percentage is like 20% right
 But then all the rest of it goes back to the people in his career that brought him up
 So, you know the person is at the college level and then the high school level junior
 How all the downs like the Pee Wee levels and said that if you were the the Pee Wee coach who found him and developed initially when you
 Got him to the next level like you think you had a contract with him saying like I get 5% of his future earnings
 Because I was the one who found him so he said he was talking about the the people who found this guy
 You know 20 years ago. It was his first coaches when they got the 70 million dollar
 Contract 5% that went back to this this original coach to his club team or whatever and
 I was like, oh my gosh
 He said yeah because he said that's how soccer works in in Europe and in these other countries, but not here in America in America
 It's you know, there's none of that happening
 He's like I'm trying to develop that here because you so it happens is that that
 They treat the game differently over there because of how how they're rewarded, right?
 It's interesting you said that you know in America
 Whether they do they take the kids and their whole goal here is to get the teams to win, right?
 So when you start soccer they'll hey, you know, you're a big kid. You're gonna be the goalie
 You're the fastest you're gonna be forward and you're this and whatever they put people in these spots, right?
 And this is like when they're whatever eight years old
 And then they start playing and say okay, we're gonna make you the best world of this spot because you're the fastest kid
 So they do that and and at first they start winning because they got the best kids and best spot and they start beating all these other kids, right?
 That what happens is that they're eight year olds and they're nine ten twenty you know twelve fifteen by ten to eighteen years old
 What's interesting is that the kid who was the fastest as an eight and eight year old isn't necessarily fastest as an 18 year old
 And so but they've been training in that one spot for the last
 You know, whatever however many years and they get the bigger levels and they start losing
 Which is why I guess apparently America doesn't do as good at the the national levels
 I think they're getting a lot better now, but they haven't been as competitive because because they train all their kids to win
 and
 Because of that they're not developing them as as athletes all like all-around athletes as much
 They said if you look at what happens over in Europe and these other countries
 You said because of the way they're financially rewarded they look at the whole game differently
 And so they bring these people players in and they don't care about winning at first
 So the only thing they care about is player development. How do we make this player better if we make this player better?
 And then it's more likely they're gonna go on the next level and different levels
 And we'll get paid some somewhere, you know in the future
 And so so that they they bring people in and they don't say because you're the fastest
 You're the for us is like we need to develop these players
 You're gonna play for and you play goalie you play this you play this and they move people around and they focus a lot on character
 Development making that person better and better and better and better
 And what happens is then all these rock stars start rising to the top and all the game developed because all the coaches focusing on the personal
 development of the player that's makes them amazing and by the time they get to these higher levels everyone who's made it through those levels have
 Been developed so far that they're amazing they can play anywhere and they're just better athletes and better soccer players
 And that's how these guys win these world championships and titles and all that kind of stuff
 And I thought that was so fascinating. I told them I said oh my gosh
 There's such a cool life lesson there. I count many times do we focus on winning right in business like I gotta make a
 Million dollars I gotta do this I gotta do that. You know focusing on winning, which is the short term win typically as opposed to
 Development and so what that means for you guys initially it's your own personal development, right?
 I a lot of times people are trying striving so hard to make a million bucks or hit to comma club or whatever the thing is
 To win they don't focus on what's wrong with them, right?
 How do I develop myself personally?
 I've been in this business now 15 years
 And if I could tell you the amount of people that I had known who've come in this world made a crap ton of money and then lost it
 All because they never developed themselves like you wouldn't even believe it
 and
 That's kind of the first phase and then you know so but those who focus on personal development
 It's why you know
 I think one of the really interesting and fascinating things about network marketing industry is that they're so heavily focused on personal
 Development which is why some people some of the great leaders come out of that profession because they focus so much on personal
 Development and you know think about me like when I was getting started
 I struggled in business and I started going to robins events and stuff like as I develop myself as a person better
 As I saw reading more books and started studying started like learning stuff
 Then my business grew as a byproduct because I became a better person
 Right and so that's kind of the first phase of the second phase is now you start having your teams and your people right?
 I think this is a mistake that
 That unknowingly I made a lot in the last decade is that I brought people in on these teams who were good
 And I said okay, you're good at this you're good at this and put people in and and then I just assumed they were gonna be amazing
 And I didn't focus on the personal on their personal development, right? I focus a lot more on the personal development of
 Honestly, you guys of my my customers, which is why I think we've been super successful
 But I haven't spent nearly enough time and attention focus on on the personal development of my team
 Which something I'm rectifying and changing now. I'm now sending a lot of my
 Internal team to different events to learn how to come better what they're doing. We're we're sending books to our people
 We're doing more personal development
 We're bringing in a coach to specifically just work with our with our team and our leaders and our people like that
 And so I'm trying to do more of that in some of our business
 So anyway, I thought I was just fascinating to look at this lesson from soccer and like how the best of world are doing this thing
 But then looking at that how do we apply that to business? It's like man. I need to work not just on like my business
 I can go win and make money
 But how do I focus on the my own personal development and then development of my team and as you start shifting the focus to that?
 All the stuff you're trying to do will come right again over
 Apparently, you know in European countries as kids
 They don't care if they want to lose that's not the focus and because that by time the top levels
 They win right and it's all the same thing here
 I stopped focusing so much on like money money money money and folks are like how do I don't develop myself?
 I've heard Stephen Larson say so many times that like business is like the best personal development
 Course of all time like you get smacked in the face. You learn so much about yourself and your abilities
 By by being part of it
 Anyways, it's fascinating so all right. That's what I got for yesterday
 So hopefully that that you just thoughts and ideas for yourself and for your team
 Something I'm gonna be focusing a lot more with my team and hopefully that'll benefit you as well
 So thanks again, you guys and I'll talk to you all soon. Bye everybody
