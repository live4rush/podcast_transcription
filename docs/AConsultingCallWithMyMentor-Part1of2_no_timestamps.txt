 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to a very special episode of the marketing secrets podcast
 Today I'm going to let you in behind the scenes on a really special conversation. I'm excited to have
 With my very first ever marketing and business mentor the guy who helped me go from you having a dream of
 You know somebody starting a business to really give me the foundational tools and insights and knowledge
 I needed to be able to launch would eventually became click funnels and someone I'm super grateful for his name is mark joiner
 He's been called the godfather of Internet marketing
 but for me he's someone that I respect as a friend and a mentor and
 I'm really excited to share this episode with you guys here as soon as we get back from the theme song
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everyone, so let me give you some context so when I first got in this game almost 15 years ago
 when I jumped in it was kind of the wild wild west there's a whole bunch of
 Stuff happening, but no one really it was just kind of crazy out there
 It was it was Google was kind of there. There are a bunch of other search engines though. No one who's gonna win
 You know before then it was before my space. There was a social network coming out called Friendster some you guys may remember that
 There was you know a couple people talking about marketing and stuff
 but there wasn't like there wasn't a lot out there and
 I got on it was kind of like the wild wild west and I was looking for stuff and I found a couple people talking about things and
 There wasn't a lot that could I could really find like today? I feel like you know
 so much of of what we do online has been very defined there's clear lines like this is what you do and how you do it like a lot of the the
 foundational
 Frameworks and things have been have been figured out they've mastered over the last 15 years and like you know a lot of you guys
 Who are jumping in the game now like it's lucky you can just jump in and here's the framework what to do
 But before that even before I got on like there were people out there trying to figure this stuff out and
 one of the early early early pioneers was a guy named Mark Joyner and Mark is I
 Mean he's got a military background. He's written a bunch of books. He's just
 an amazing person for so many reasons and I remember as I was starting my search online trying to figure things out I
 Can't hear you his name pop up and I didn't I didn't know who was who I didn't understand the whole you know
 Any of any of the landscape of who was important to not but I remember I heard his name a couple times and all of
 Then I saw this campaign come out and seemed like everybody's who email us
 I had joined at that point where all of a sudden emails out
 Saying the mark joiner the godfather of internet marketing is retiring and and he's leaving behind everything and he's you know
 He wants to shift what he's doing in life
 he's selling off all the source code all the sites and projects and and I would I remember it was probably one of the best hooks I've ever
 Like heard I was like what and we're going to the sales page and reading this thing
 It's called the mark joiner farewell package and we're reading the sales page and I was like I have to have this
 Like if I had this if my life would change, you know, and I was like I have to have it
 I was going crazy because I wanted I needed to buy it the problem was with a thousand bucks
 I just married my beautiful wife. We were more than broke. I was a wrestler who was making zero dollars an hour
 she was a
 Secretary making nine dollars and fifty cents an hour and we had a
 Little house we were that I just read rich dad poor dad so I bought this like duplex
 I was renting out half of it, you know, so we were mean
 It was like as poor as you could get right
 and
 But it was you know same time as my wife I talked about was like the best time of our life
 Like it was just so much fun like I sometimes like we missed that part of it
 But I still remember I'm in this house. I'm reading the farewell package
 I want to buy it
 I can't afford it and I don't want to do I don't have a credit card at the time and my wife had one
 But she had like, you know before we got married she had a credit card
 So we had like had some help us pay it off and we were paying that person back
 So we're trying not to get to debt and all sorts of stuff and I remember reading the sales pitch and then all these people
 Promoting it and it's got a mic chin kept promoting like crazy
 And I remember I listened this interview with Mike Chen and Mark Joyner talking about how to have success in in business
 And basically like yet like you need two thousand dollars at least get started and part out some go to buy the farewell package
 for thousand bucks
 But he needs to start a capital actually do something and I listen to sing all night and bet my bed over and over and over again
 I was like I have to invest in this thing and
 It's funny now like looking back on how scared I was but like how grateful I am that Mark was willing to be a
 marketer and to sell a product he believed in that he had created and and that he had given me urgency and scarcity and like
 desired for this thing because
 You know that next morning woke up and I told Kled I was like
 I think that this is the thing and she's like you try to tell the stuff like you really think this is it
 I feel like this is the this is the thing I need and she said okay, and then I trust you and so
 You know we called the bank we upped the credit card limit a little bit and I went and bought the defer well package and
 Remember a week or two later showed up right when my wife and I were leaving
 It was like our one year anniversary and my parents were flying to Hawaii
 They were taking us with us and so I had my little CD Walkman player and on the flight and listening to the CDs in the in the air
 From this farewell package is mark. You're telling the the war stories to how they built his companies back then again
 Pretty everything he was building search engines and like getting him index and building huge email list without you doing
 I would love to actually go back and maybe I'll do that I should go back and re-listen that whole course
 He had so many these brilliant ideas. They're like when you can't run Facebook ads
 How do you how do you build a list right when they're when there are no paper click search engines besides the one that you built by the way?
 He's one of the first paper click search engines you like like
 How do you do it?
 And so he had to be super creative and he had all these amazing ideas and ways and he had some websites of blip
 Do on the top like 30 or 40 websites in the world highest traffic websites like just all these amazing things that he he developed
 So I remember listening to these CDs and just getting so many ideas about what to do and how to do it
 It was really foundational for me
 And you know I think of all the lessons I learned from marketing I learned a ton of them
 but what the one that was the most impactful was was the focus point like building an email list like you have to build a list you have to
 Build a list and that season of the internet marketing game is when AdSense sites became this thing and you know
 Everyone's crank get these ads in sites and making insane amounts of money
 And I kept wanting to like shift my focus that I just kept hearing his voice in my head
 I didn't know him yet personally, but from listening to his course so many times like folks. I'm building list folks
 I'm building list like that's what you got to do
 And so I went backless fundamentals and I was annoyed as everyone else was making millions of dollars around me doing nothing building garbage sites
 And then when when that dried up and disappeared overnight
 I was so grateful for him as a mentor who stuck me to the fun to the fundamentals and
 You have to mark did this farewell package. He sold off all the source code stuff
 And he disappeared for like a year
 I have no idea where he went and then a year later he came back and and was just kind of like helping some people and you know
 I jumped in and like dude you have no idea how much you've helped me
 You know and we had a chance to connect a little bit there and talk a few times
 I had a chance to interview him and it was just such a cool
 It was cool for him to do that it meant the world to some like me who you know
 He was he was he was everything to me and it was so cool
 He was willing to come back in and to share and and then about a year later
 So he he launched a new company and it was in more than the personal development space was called simpleology
 I remember when he came back. There's all he you know all the naysayers have to come in like oh
 I thought you were retiring from the internet marketing like I was retiring from teaching internet marketing wasn't retiring from using the internet
 Like I'm not an idiot like I've heard this internet things probably gonna last a little while and he created this cycle
 Simpleology he launched it grew really really big really fast and then
 You know I said I don't know exactly what happened. I have my assumptions. I think he you know
 I think he had had so much success and earlier things than when they start happening as you know
 I don't know maybe it was relationship things
 Maybe his family things I don't know but but I don't feel like he was really engaged in in the game for for a long time
 I think that simpleology, you know was working
 He made a bunch of money built a big list
 But he didn't really tend after for I mean who know maybe a decade or so and it's there
 It's been it's been doing its thing, but just hasn't hasn't
 You know like I don't know just it just hasn't had his attention his focus and
 You know I was lucky enough to two or three years ago
 He came out we spent a day or two together
 I helped him build a funnel which was really fun and just super cool to go back and do that with my my original mentor
 In fact we launched that funnel, but it's funny. We've filmed the whole like funnel after TV episode
 We haven't got that live yet. I'm gonna have to go back and
 Y'all branded on my team to see when get that thing live because it's really cool like just the whole thing and I had so much fun
 having him here Boise and just
 Yeah, back to one of the things I remember his one of his original books was a book called mind control marketing
 Which was the book we actually did the funnel for it and I remember he opened up and he signed his name
 And I looked at like that night. It's just something like to my number one student. I was like, oh my gosh, that is so cool
 There's enough for me for fanboying. So let me let me talk about what the point of this of this podcast is
 So it's been interesting like I feel like when Mark came out to Boise we spent the day or two together
 I feel like you know we kind of caught him on fire got him really excited about stuff
 I think you saw how much excitement we're having with click funnels and like the team and like everything and I think he was
 You know kind of getting getting excited to get back into it
 And I've seen him do more and more stuff over the last year or two since he came out here and and I can feel like
 I don't know
 I know it's it's like the Phoenix rise in the ash like this rebirth of excitement from him and like and I feel like right now
 He's in this momentum or he's like hey, I want to do this thing and so the other night he posted something on Facebook
 It was what was that about almost a month ago right now?
 So he posted this thing and so I'm gonna read you what he posted so he posted marketing gurus
 This is your chance to humiliate me number one. I've been stepping up my game lately number two
 This is just the beginning number three. I want your advice on how to step it up even more better PR better offers better social
 Brought a reach better copyright and better public speaking better. Whatever the F number four be brutally honest skin is thick AF ego
 And check mind wide open and then just don't be a yes. There's no be a jerk about it
 I said bonus. I think it's supposed to get some wide attention
 See this as a free advertising arm to me for yourself. It also is deposit to mark join her favorite bank
 I'm not a Lannister, but I was paying my debts so
 That's kind of what he posted. I remember reading that's like oh man like
 so so
 so interesting and
 Then I kind of sat back and I watched I saw his comments started flooding in and as of today
 There's 167 comments and tells you we get advice tons of games some bad advice
 But all of all the vice that there was it were in there
 There was one from actually my first one of the first people I mentored
 It's Justin Brooke and and I think his
 His was the closest to what I would say in a short form and then then if I had more time with Mark
 I would sit back and I have come a long form of a bigger bigger strategy things that I would talk about with him and so
 And so what I'm gonna do I'm actually gonna read Justin
 I'm gonna share a couple of quick thoughts I had based on that and then I wanted to sit
 I basically record this if I was sitting down with Mark
 I told him ahead of time I was gonna record this I said look I would love to do some more of a long form right
 I like this is consultation. I'm gonna go through
 Six or seven things I would really look at if I was you and I love I could record this and I'll send you the audio
 And then and then you can basically have it
 But I want to publish this podcast too because I think this is gonna help so many people who have kind of a similar situation
 And he said yes
 And they came back said what if we do that and then I go implement much stuff
 You said and then we do a read you know an update podcast later kind of showing the results
 I was like do that be awesome. So I'm totally into that
 So this is the first podcast of a two-part series probably which would be cool. So all right
 So let me read you what Justin Brooks said. So Justin said
 Said with the most with the utmost respect and love I am your rating fan
 But I do see some things that can be improved number one you seem to be falling to the trap
 For all great marketers are doing too much high-level advanced stuff and not enough of the basics
 Maybe your goals are different. Maybe you don't want the attention
 But your pages your profile sales page even the ui of simple. Oh, geez very dated. It's not keep me up with what's currently popular or best practices
 It's number one. Number two is confusing who you are today. Are you in the fitness niche? Are you marketing your personal element?
 I know you was the godfather of internet marketing. What happened to that messaging?
 Where's the story on my where's that story in your profile pictures bio cover what cover photo website YouTube channel?
 If it's not that anymore than what how do you want me to brag about you to my friends?
 Which is the cool line and then number three?
 Simplology is a great productivity soft is the great productivity software on the market
 But it looks like the oldest productivity software on the market. It should be an app on my phone. It should look like Trello
 It should be easy and intuitive like workflow
 And it should have comparison pages to to sauna to do late to do list Trello work flooring
 I love you dude. You do no wrong my mind, but since you asked
 alright, so
 Three really good things
 number one was it he's lost of the mark does a marked brilliant which is the curse of most geniuses is it he's gotten he speaks a very high level and
 And for people who are seeking improvement
 We love that we plug into it. The problem is most people don't seek for improvement people are looking for new opportunities
 I'm talking about here in a minute and
 The new opportunities needs things that a much basic more basic level again number two
 I think there's some huge confusion like where he fits in the market and number three is a simple analogy
 They said it looks very outdated
 So let's come into three things now a couple things
 I had some like fast things
 I wanted to kind of throw out there like if I was to write a post to follow suggestions
 I'd have like a quick thing before I dive into like the longer more fun detail geeking out on
 Strategy and principal stuff. So I'm gonna go through some of the core things really quickly to Justin's three the things I would I would probably add
 The first moment I'm gonna go with simple. I'll do it kind of what he talked about with the
 It said the simple. Oh, geez the great protein if you saw for the market
 But it looks like the oldest protein you saw from the market and I would say something similar
 Mark after you came out. I'm gonna speak to mark just directly for the rest of this probably hope that's okay
 so mark when you came to Boise and
 We were geeky actually all click funnel stuff
 You kind of the same thing with simpleology you logged us in and created counts for me and my team
 And we were all excited to kind of use it because you know we started doing it and you know the the word
 like the root word is simple simpleology and it
 By default isn't very simple like it was it was by far one of the more more most complex like project management task
 Imagine the thing that I had used
 Because that we didn't get traction like like me and Stephen Larson as you know
 We were like geeking out like we're gonna do this and we try for for week two weeks
 I was going through all the black belt white belt all the training and stuff and and the by the time I choose
 We see in like literally what the phrase we says like this is not simple at all
 This is this is very complex
 We're gonna go back to Trello because it's simple and so that's what we do
 We shift it back to the system that was that was actually very simple
 And so that was like one big piece of feedback
 Well why we didn't get traction when we didn't stick is because
 The simplicity wasn't actually there especially for product as simplicity like we're simple in the name
 It's like we have to make it more simple and you know I say that
 Looking at at click phones which once again is very similar to like most complex software on the planet
 And my biggest hurdle I have in click phones to gain people to consume the software the point where they can actually use it
 And so I totally understand that and it's funny
 You know we're trying to do more of this now, but it's hard this deep in the game for us
 Is instead of like giving people all the complexity we were like if I could build click phones from the ground up again
 Like I say I sold it for billion dollars. I had a five-year non-compete or whatever
 I was starting over five years from now
 I would make click fun. I was so simple and I would force people to opt into complexity
 Right, so I was like I would basically make click phones look like lead page
 It's like you can create a page that's it and they would go in there
 They could drag and drop new things around like oh this is easy and they're like oh you have a page which I do a funnel
 I'm like yeah, that'd be awesome
 I click a button and it's like okay. Let me coach you on what a funnel is first
 We explain the concept behind it and then you then they click a button to unlock
 That complexity would add it to it. Right, so that way
 We have a basic saw that way all I have to do like for my onboarding if people stick with the software is
 Get them to come into the very simplest easiest thing just convince them of that and they use that and they get it
 They get a quick win like oh my gosh, that's easy and then for them to add next thing
 It's not just like click the button and go into it
 It's they have to watch a video get trained on it
 And then when they when they we they often that complexity it's not complex because they just went through training cycle to understand that right
 And I totally finally again if I just do click phones from scratch today, that's what I would do is I'd make it simple and then
 And then every time they want to add complexity to opt into it
 They watch the training then unlocks and I wouldn't sell them for each upsell
 I would just I would just opt in to complexity and keep getting those things
 Um as they as they do it so for for you
 I know you said you have a new version coming out and so I would just look at that
 It's just right now super complex
 For something that's called simple and I would look at like okay
 Let's actually make it simple and then unlock the complexity as they go deeper. That's number one
 uh number two
 I logged in tonight to
 Simple objects. I haven't used it for a while
 Is I logged in and put me immediately to an upsell flow
 Which I respect as a marketer
 But as a consumer drove me crazy with the three upsells and the third upsell was if sells video with comments down below and I couldn't even get in software
 And so I had a lot and I logged out and re logged in and then took me to software
 I was like I can't even like this software because it's pretty many two upsells
 And um, you know someone who who loves upsells and downsells more than anyone on on human earth on planet earth
 I also know that um my lifetime value of my customers
 Um if i'm not careful upsells and downsells will destroy the lifetime value
 Back, you know in in a pre-click funnels life when we were before I you know before I
 Um really understood in fact I can tell you the story behind this is every one of my funnels back
 They would always have three upsells and three downsells
 So if you said note everything went through six things every single time and like we were pulling out tons of money
 So I thought it was right and it was interesting is um one of my friends came out with this new software
 Um it was Garrett Pearson and Scott Brannley and they came out this new software called shopper proved and they were like
 Hey, put this on your thank you page. You know, this is when people are most happy
 They just bought something that's so excited and then they review you and you get really good reviews
 I was like cool. So I put this thing on my on my thank you page for one of our funnels during a launch
 And um and then awesome the reviews start coming in. I was like this is awesome
 So I let it run for you know four or five hours in the middle of the launch and then I logged in to see what my
 My stars look like I think my overall rating was like two and a half stars
 And I was like what like these are my best buyers these guys should love me right now
 And I show me in the comments people like if I see one more app upsell
 I'm gonna kill you like like I don't even want your product anymore
 I like all these things and I was like oh my gosh my customers hate me
 And it's because we took them through so complex um upsell process
 and so for me I always look at like how do I
 I go on as many upsells as possible without making the person angry
 So if you look at like like evolution of funnels for me, especially like funnels when we have upsells and downsells like um
 I'm very very carefully. That's why we kind of pioneered the whole order form bumping because someone would buy a product
 You know they in a two step order formula they put in their shipping address then right before the submit
 But we have an order form bump and we start putting those things in because um it would it would increase our cart value
 But people didn't look at it as an upsell and so didn't decrease customer happiness, right?
 So like we had bumps those bumps that we plugged in there
 And then I used to go on from having six upsell downsells to the max like I have an internal rule like the most we can have is two
 Okay, if it's an upsell downsell that's it if it's upsell upsell that's it like but we can like for me
 I we never go more than two. That's like an internal rule. Everyone company knows like we do too. That's it
 Um and from that point
 Um our happiness level our lifetime value our customers have dramatically gone it because they're not sick of us by time it's over
 So that's kind of thing. Just look at like for me log in I went through three upsells and then I couldn't even get the software
 And this is me long in I'm sure it's similar not signing up for the first time
 I would just look at you know when someone's creating an account my software
 It's more important for me to get them using the software than for me to make revenue immediately
 Okay, no, that's not always true in in the sixth thing I have here for you
 There are front and funnels with it with a goal the focus of upsell downselling
 But then from there I push them into into my software and click funnels is is
 Very light on any kind of upselling to sign a process
 Because I just want them to have a good experience and to stick that's the most important thing for me
 Okay, and then the third thing I would say again. This is my quick my quick feedback my my facebook poster
 I would have made is um is the concept of significance and I share this this is one
 I've been kind of nervous to share, but I think it's really really important
 and um
 And it's
 I don't want to name names because this podcast republic and things like that, but
 It's been interesting in my journey like
 um, I've had a lot of I've had a lot of chance to work with people who um
 who um
 In fact the first time I heard about this I was I was in a car ride with Tony Robbins and and Tony was talking about doing um a partnership
 Somebody asked my opinions on I was like, I like that person. They're pretty good
 You see yeah, the problem is that person's significant driven therefore I'm not gonna do the deal with them
 I was like, oh my gosh, like am I significant driven? I was freaking out and you know
 I'm having Tony Robbins looking at my soul. I'm like my significance driven and made me really really nervous
 I've always been cautious that ever since like I don't want to be significant driven
 I want to be driven by by other needs right like like other things and and all of us have just
 Significance like it's part of what we do. It's what drives especially as entrepreneurs and significance
 Um, but what I found is a lot of people especially from the from the old their time, right?
 Like um the the foundational time and these are offline gurus for I respect I love
 Um, and some of the early online guys is that um, they got a lot of significance where they did
 and um, and I know that um, and you specifically kind of told me this before when uh, I think I had an event I wanted to speak at and
 and
 This is before click files came out. Be said, you know, I can only do it if if I'm if I'm the keynote speaker because I need to maintain my my branding and my
 my
 um, my positioning and I was like
 Oh, that's I understand that but the problem is that it if you're if you're not careful with that like it ruins opportunities
 And it's funny. I was talking to Dave Woodward on my team about this. Um, pretty in depth
 I said, you know
 It's interesting like how much significance I have right now in my life like more than I could ever even hope for and the less I try to be significant
 The more significance I get right the more I push it away the more I get and it's funny because I see I see a lot of people who hold on
 Significance and they want to be significant feels significant because of that they they they um, they disappear from from the from the
 The public face and and so for me the biggest thing I'd say that I feel like you're doing it now
 if I just post is a great example of it is being willing to be vulnerable and um
 is
 And like coming off of that like like breaking posture is what draws people towards you
 And in the early days the internet was different because it wasn't social media, right? It was it was um, it was ads and it was
 emails and it was clicks and so it didn't matter as much but in today's world where everything social like
 um significance actually repels people it's like a magnet that pushes people away where vulnerability
 Um is what draws people in and so and you can see that from this post right here alone
 And so for me, it's like when I talk about my significance and my achievements my accomplishments stuff like that
 Um, it never draws people towards me when I talk about my failures my my things I struggle with
 um things like that it draws people towards me and so there's a part of this there's a point in your stories and things to have that
 significance where it's like
 Hey, I did this about you know, I did blah blah blah blah blah, but if you look at any of my webinars or my my stories my videos
 Like I touch upon significance like I I I say things to so people know that i'm significant
 But then I I jump off that as fast as I possibly can right?
 Like I'm basically like oh, here's here's the you know, here's I had a chance to build a funnel for Tony Robbins
 So that he launched his new book boom
 There's like a huge significance hit but then I jump back and like oh my gosh
 It was the most stressful thing in the world. This is why I'm scared
 This is like and I go into that and awesome. They're like oh my gosh. She's human
 He was scared. She's like I would have been scared and that's what draws them in me doing something Tony does not
 It gives me the credibility but significance actually pushes pushes things away
 And so for you, it's like the more vulnerable you get
 The more your audience is going to connect with you and they're going to build with you and the more you kind of put significance away
 And again, I feel like you're doing it now anyway, which is awesome
 That's something that when you were in Boise, I wanted to say to you. I didn't know how to say it to you
 I've just like
 Because I look at you and I'm like man, I have so much respect for you like
 Like why why does most people in our world not know who who mark joiners right now?
 It's like because
 You know partially it's obviously by design like that wasn't your goal that wasn't your mission at the time
 But it's like but but part of it was just because it's like you were trying to to maintain a certain positioning
 Um, which made you lose your positioning, right?
 I always tell people now like like by trying to be significant you'll lose your certificates by giving it away is when you become significant
 And um, it's kind of a hard thing to explain but I hope that hope that kind of makes sense
