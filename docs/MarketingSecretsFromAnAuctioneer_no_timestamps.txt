 What's up everybody this is Russell. I just jumped in the Tesla and drive into the office and I got something cool
 I want to share with you
 We had a chance to go to a wrestling auction this week and some of the salesmanship and marketing principles
 That I saw we're amazing and someone talked through them and how you can plan to your business
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everybody welcome back. I hope you guys are excited. I've had a good week this week
 I'm working on some fun projects with the
 Mustifying of Dan Kennedy's company with ClickFunnels and a new offer is coming out and a bunch of stuff
 And so I wake up every morning at five this week and I just been excited and got a lot of work done
 It's been good. You know feeling like when you're excited about something how much easier just to wake up and do the thing
 It's been a while since I felt that way in fact. I was last night's thinking I learned last time
 I was just excited about working on something in the business and if I'm honest myself
 It was one of the traffic secret book launch which is now almost like two years ago now
 Not right a year and a half ago anyway
 So anyway, it's still good. We do some fun. So hopefully all you guys got something fun
 You're working on because it just makes everything else better
 anyway, okay, so as you guys know, I'm a wrestler my ears are all caulf-floured up and my
 Kids some of them like wrestling some hate wrestling, but I've got one stronghold who loves wrestling and so
 Which is great and so we went to the wrestling bank with this year where they were raising money for the wrestling team and so
 We were there ready to support and hope donate money so that the team can you know get the stuff
 We need to be a good team and I also helped coach. So I'm one of the coaches too, but anyway
 We go to the wrestling bank way and in the past these two do a spaghetti feed
 They have spaghetti everyone come the wrestlers are the people and they have like a silent auction and I think it said the best year ever
 Was like $6,000 raised I think the average years like four or five thousand so that's kind of a context of where we're starting up
 so this time around they
 They met one of the coaches the coaches wife or someone met these guys who do
 auctions they're an auction company and
 We're basically go up there and instead of just like having a silent auction where you people bid on stuff
 That's like an auction you're up top and he's like doing the yeah, can I get five?
 I get five all that kind of stuff like that they do, right?
 And so it was weird because it was it was in a bar so they didn't like kids
 So just the parents the first of a kind like this is weird like I don't know how it's gonna work like
 They still have silent auction and we bid on some things whatever
 And then we had dinner and after dinner they had the auctioneers get up and start the process
 And this is where the marketing gold started happening
 And as a marketing nerd that I am I was just like freaking out like watching the process and how they did it
 And how they were able to get the room excited about giving up money and
 Spoiler alert when it all said and done they raised almost $40,000 for wrestling. So yeah, like yeah a lot
 Um and that's not counting we gave extra donations on top. It's just like the rest of the people right?
 Which was really really cool. And so
 Um
 A couple of things the first thing they did the auctioneers got up there
 First thing they did is they had to build a rapport with the audience because by default you're like oh these
 Those are gonna sell me something and so there's no rapport
 So they get up there and they start telling their stories who they are and how their family business and how they get into this
 And they just kind of told these stories and jokes
 Really quickly to try to build rapport as quick as they could right? So the first thing second thing is they had to train everybody how to buy
 And this was really fascinating
 What they did initially is like we're gonna get the auctions process started when tch is how it works
 And they held up $500 cash. We're gonna start at $500 cash
 And uh the way that you can win the $500 cash is uh if you buy a $20
 Thing like you bid $20 or you pay $20 and you um you get a chance to to win this $500 right?
 So who would pay your $20 for a chance win 500 and all the money goes to wrestling so it's gonna be good right
 They started doing this and um
 I don't know how many people did it, but you know most of the audience put in there $20 to win this thing
 And they had a lot of energy and it's fun. It was exciting and the end of it um
 You know they drew somebody in someone with a $500
 They got $500 and the person like gave the $500 back to you know
 Just put it in towards wrestling and so from that one little exercise they raised $1,500 for wrestling
 Right the the $500 came back and then um the $20 bills like was $5
 There's a thousand dollars worth of of $20 orders that went through really quickly and so they made $1,500
 But that first thing it was interesting because you're paying $20 for a chance to win 500
 So it's like a no-brainer like I'll just try it
 But what they were really doing if you look at the strategies they were teaching people how to bid right for some like me
 Who'd never been in auction before I didn't know how to hold the paddle or how it worked and you know all those kind of things
 And so this gave us the ability to learn at a very low risk thing with the worst case you lose $20 right
 Best case win 500. So it's like a really you know risk reward thing was was very very very easy to say yes to
 and it's interesting because
 Training the audience is so important in everything you're doing. In fact, um
 I remember I learned this originally from bill glazer at their super conferences
 Uh day number one they would do a charity offer where he had this whole swipe file book
 He's like hey you panted allers to charity you get the book and everyone ran back and and they closed like most of the room
 In fact, I remember running back and had a hundred dollar bill and get given the hundred dollar bill getting this book
 And um it was like the first time I had uh
 I had seen that happen
 I didn't understand it until my next match my meeting when bill glazer got up and explained his strategy
 He said day number one my biggest goal in the event is to train the audience how to buy it
 Because I don't want them trying to figure out how to buy when i'm doing my high ticket $25,000 sell right?
 I want them to know how to buy on something that's low risk
 That's not scary
 And so he's like day number one. I would do a charity thing because number one it builds rapport because you're helping people
 Number two you're actually helping people which is awesome and number three though it trains the audience on how
 To um to buy and so they learn how to stand up they learn where to go
 They learn how to go and where the forms are at they go through the whole process once
 And then when you ask them to buy two days later, they're you know how to do it. They're not confused, right?
 And so you're training the audience how to buy it so
 Um again, they auctioneer did that they trained us how to buy it something that was super low risk
 Um, we do it at our fun hacking live events bill glazer did their events where we're training people how to stand up
 Go to the back of the room give money on something that's that's very low risk, right?
 Um, so that's how we did we've done it events but how could you do it during your webinars? How could you do during?
 You know, uh, there's so many things that you could you could leverage that idea of like how to train the audience how to buy
 Something small before you're asking them for the big purchase
 That was the first thing next thing they go out there and they start auctioning off these different packages
 And I wish I would have had a pad of paper notes that night that it happened
 I was just like freaking out about everything but I kind of just remember the core the core things are stuck out
 So next thing is it wasn't just one dude on stage doing the auction, right?
 That's how I would have thought it was going to be but the auctioneer had like four or five people in the audience walking around
 So people the audience would do a couple things number one is they were making noise
 So it felt like even though there wasn't a lot of people bidding it felt like there was because you could hear the
 The auction of the people on the audience talking and uh, you know, the that there are seeds out the audience talking and creating energy and creating momentum and social
 Proof that people were bidding and so
 They were walking around and as they were doing that they started figuring out who are the people that want this offer, right?
 And so the people in the audience would see like okay, this person bid 50 this person bid 100
 150 to start lay looking at the people who are bidding so then it starts isolating from the entire audience like here's the
 The five or six people that are bidding and you get closer and closer the the people within the audience walking around the auctioneers is partners or whatever you call them
 They start identifying okay. These are the these are the three people who want this and so then they
 Owning all those people and as the auctions happening they're like like he's a 250 only three three three and then like they're kind of like
 um helping nerd, you know, uh push and like urge them to bid up and so pushing bids up next person goes back
 And so now it's the elements auctioneers are standing side by side with the with the two or three
 You know whales in the audience who are going to buy and using that as a way to up the bid
 They can move it higher higher higher higher to the point where you know these things that probably would sold for 50 bucks at a silent auction
 We're selling for 1500 or 2000 dollars because of the way the process worked and was really really fascinating
 um and so I started seeing that so um
 You know, how could you replicate that you could replicate in a lot of ways right like in an event you could replicate that when you
 Um, you know, it's creating social proof like you think about
 um
 You know when you get a table rush if you don't get table rush is hard because nobody moves right
 But if you can get people to stand up and run to the back of the room as soon as a couple people run back and people see that it creates social proof
 like I remember um
 During my fun hiking live presentation and I was speaking a lot on stages and and doing the whole process like that
 Um, I remember I would usually the very first time I dropped the price
 It's weird because usually like one or two people to get up and at first I was just like I was like
 I like filling all awkward like oh man like only two people got up
 I don't want to say things like everyone through the rest of my pitch and going through things
 You know and and over to the pitch more people would go more people would go
 And I remember just one time I was doing a pitch
 And I got up and I was I got the point I showed the price and there are two three people that jumped up
 And I don't remember why but some reason it startled me or I was like, oh wow and I kind of stopped and I said whoa
 I'm like those those people are there they get it
 They've already started moving and I pointed to the the people who were walking towards the back of the room
 You know like jogging towards the back of their nearby and everyone else stopped and looked back and they saw like
 30 people running and also like oh my gosh, this is legit
 And I don't want me to back the line. Also the next person popped up next from pop
 And also like it was just like sprint to the back and it created this table rush
 And it's kind of the similar processes like it's like if you get one of the people who are in who are going to buy
 Right they're starting to walk the back of the room. Don't just like be secret about like all the like oh my gosh
 Like I've got the pitch in look at these guys already in the back room buying
 Um, dude, you know the price is that you're already in and they're like yeah, I'm already in like oh my gosh
 Like they get it if you guys get this you know, this is the way and I just like you
 Have my permission stand up and go right now, right?
 And we create this thing and they start moving it was just really cool to be able to
 To see these marketing and sales principles that we use in different places used here inside of
 Uh, this this auction raised money for wrestling and so I started thinking
 Um one of my first mentors
 I've had a lot of really good mentors in life. One of them was jabraham
 What jabram taught me really well was to look at things happening other industries and how do you model them for yours?
 And so really like
 My goal with this was to kind of share with you guys a couple of just quick examples from the auction
 But hopefully open up your eyes so you start seeing all the sales and marketing happening around you, right?
 Um, you look at click phones
 We launched our dream car contest like people are like how do you come up with that?
 I'm like because I looked over at this other industry the network marketing industry
 And they give away cars to people and gets people to go crazy to build up their companies
 I was like we're gonna take that concept from this industry and move it over right from the auction industry like I saw what they did over here
 Next time we do our fundraiser fun like you live i'm gonna do things differently because when I learned over here, right?
 So it's looking at other industries beside drone looking at what they are doing. How are they marketing? How are they doing sales?
 How can you replicate that and pull that into your business?
 And I hope that's the principle I kind of got to today is just understanding that like this
 There's amazing marketing sales happening in so many places there's businesses the industries that have proven stuff right in this auction industry
 You guys can do this for a decade. They have all their whole family does they they tested they tweak
 I'm sure that they've done a you know a thousand auctions a year
 They test all these things and how to say and when to say and all the the different
 subtleties how do you say that word of how to make it work?
 And so you can come look at that and see the process and just be um, it's like sitting there
 You know at school learning learning how to increase your sales online
 So keep your eyes open watch other than issues see what they're doing
 Click on every ad you see because you have no idea what where it's gonna
 You know what rabbit holes can take you down what you're gonna learn what you can discover for your own for your own business as well
 And uh, I hope that helps one other side tangent. I did this recently. I had my wife's phone
 I thought it was mine. I grabbed it
 Open up facebook and I was like this is not my facebook because she follows different ads and from people so the ads
 She's retarded with her completely different than mine and I was like fascinated and started clicking on her ads
 So taking me on this magical wonderland of of offers and ad and products and funnels
 I never seen before um all because it looked from a different lens
 So same thing look at you know go to facebook creative fake profile and like things that are the opposite
 You don't really look and start seeing an ad show up and what things you can learn from different industries and
 It gets really powerful. So hope it helps. Thanks so much for everything and I'll talk to you guys all again soon. Bye everybody
