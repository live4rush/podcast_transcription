 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome to marketing seekers podcast today. We'll be talking about the seven-day launch
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out of the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 Hey everyone, this is Russell and welcome you back to the marketing seekers podcast so today I'm gonna be talking is about
 This launch right here and the reason why is my inner circle members keep asking me here
 Russell can you please show us what just happened behind the scenes of the seven-day launch they want the stats numbers of details
 And so I thought I'm gonna kill two birds of one stone
 Because I wanted to talk about some podcasts anyway, and so this is for my circle members and for those you guys who are listening to the podcast
 I hope you love it. So I might then go deep into the numbers
 I will just tell you that this launch in seven days at over a million dollars in coaching sales
 Which is exciting and so it worked
 I initially learned about this concept from one of my friends Brendan Bouchard
 If you watch funnel hacker TV the behind the scenes show you'll see some of the behind scenes of us kind of going through this
 He was in Las Vegas and I flew out there and there's a whole episode on funnel hacker dot TV
 You see me flying to Vegas hanging out Brendan kind of get his ideas on how he did this
 So I'm not gonna go too deep into all the strategies just because I know he is launching a course later on this year
 And I'm gonna be buying it you shall buy it. We should all buy it's gonna be amazing
 I'm kind of going deep into details and give you swipe files and stuff like that
 But if you were watching you probably saw it first off and second off
 You probably got this white files just by getting my emails and stuff
 So you guys you've got some feedback or you've been funnel hacking me and watching you've been having a chance kind of see it
 So basically the way it worked is we did the book launch for the first 30 days
 I wish build a lot of pressure and excitement we made a lot of book sales and up sales everything else and
 At the end of it. I want to do something cool a couple of them
 I wanted to I wanted to figure out how to like those who want to go deeper like how do I offer a coaching program in a way
 That's not like me being like I didn't want to like feel like I was selling again because just you know
 It's like after a while. It's like people don't want to be sold
 But I say no like I wanted to sell a coaching program help people want to go the next level with it
 which was exciting, but then
 Second off like I wanted to give and serve and so when Brendan kind of told me this idea like I love it
 So basically a Sunday launch works is and those who sought
 Basically what happened is Monday I started promoting it and then Tuesday. I did this long training
 So if you're watching the video you can see
 They want to basically did an episode
 from 11 till noon ish I can't remember exactly how it all went and
 Module one was like you becoming an expert and was interesting is like the the book prom was all about expert secrets, right?
 But there's stuff like so you write a book
 There's this weird finality like it's written and it's done and like you can't edit it or touch it again
 And there are things like as we're selling out like oh and during my interviews
 All these things can come me up and I'm like oh stuff
 I wish I could share and there's pieces like I want to just kind of do so what's cool like this giving the ability to like
 To not reteach the book because people have the book, but it's like here's here's a masterclass of like what's next like if you
 Read the book and you're like what's next piece? What is it?
 And so this one here
 I've been really people like you becoming an expert finding your voice and it was just training and it was awesome
 So we did is we emailed and so on
 Expert secrets masterclass.com at the time there was a video there
 I'll the embedded live video from YouTube you can watch and print all that through email, but then we also set up Facebook live
 I think it's just those two platforms and so when we started to click record. I came on basically hey guys recording a course
 It's gonna be awesome. I'm gonna jump up here start recording
 So I'll be back in a minute and then click go and then it was like live and so I taught this tire thing
 He's training was awesome. Then during the breaks we had
 testimonial videos kind of streaming of our coaching program of
 The fat event the final high-clun event things like that
 So you can like just keep seeing you know good success stories took a break
 It's like a go to bathroom reset. I came back top number two
 Which was like creating your ears the ears just fell off her and that was it for day one
 And so I think it was up there for three hours. It was awesome
 when I'll send that think by like 20 or 30,000 people that watch it between YouTube and Facebook and
 Just gave tons of goodwill. It was rudely. It was cool and
 And a lot of people who may have been stuck on these two pieces
 I had a chance to go deeper on that and kind of give them everything right
 So I was day number one and then this replay is up for 24 hours and then it disappeared
 And so people had a chance to watch it for 24 hours and then some did some didn't and then disappeared the day - started
 The day - I went into the big domino
 And went really deep helping people understand that and I had a break again
 And then when I did that that out the late session actually did a webinar
 Now it's a little different from Brandon when he did his basically the end of the day - when he like pushed people to
 video cells that were which sold like a product from the edge of the webinar now one of the big things that was kind of interesting is like
 When we created this offer
 You know part of this training is really cool and desirable a lot of people are gonna be able to watch it live
 And you pull down each day so people actually want the content and the training so at the end this
 I'm not selling this as a course because it'd be hard sell people like oh I miss part of I should have watched it
 But all those kind of things so instead it was like if you join the coaching program you get all this
 this course for free and and notice I didn't say the recordings of this product because like
 Recording seems really really cheap getting this course the expert seekers masterclass
 The perceived values way higher so it was the course not the recordings
 If you watch the videos back I tried to say that I think a couple times I messed up instead of recordings
 I was trying to like get it perfect right so that was that was here and it was cool
 Then they happen and some sell you know sell started coming in for the coaching program because it was a webinar
 They got to watch me do webinar, but then I was actually selling the coach program on the webinar now
 What's happening soon is done? It's funny because this first time I ever done this webinar we created the 94
 It was like perfect webinar hack styles was like headline three secrets a board with like the things
 I pitched two offers, which is usually a wrong thing to do and it was in this case - we had a
 2000 or 15,000 it was just complicated when you get to the stack and like so sales did okay, but I was kind of
 Honestly like when the camera shut off. I was sitting there. I kind of depressed like dang like that did not feel right
 They didn't didn't convert right. I mean some people bought
 but it wasn't it wasn't right and I was just like dang it and I was frustrated and I was like kind of stressing out about it and
 And realizing that and so then we made some tweaks and some changes and cool things day three
 I came back and actually broke down the campaign
 So I showed him and I went through the webinar again
 And what was cool about this second webinar or the second training is because I was like going through what I did and what worked
 What didn't work? I knew kind of what hadn't worked the first time so that's really cool opportunity to go and weave in
 Different clothes different stacks different things to to close the deal from the day before and I'm gonna talk about why I think this is
 So key here at second because I think I figured out something amazing, but
 After that session self-start coming in like crazy
 Like the second webinar where I broke down I did here, but then use that hopefully as watch that's not you missed it
 But I was weaving in all these clothes throughout it was kind of a cool thing
 And but I was just breaking down what we were actually doing and then in break then ended I did a virtual book tour
 Which is just a kind of a bonus training about how we got traffic and then that was it and so
 And on that one end it sells coming in better than maybe four
 So like hey, I was able to fix some of the things that I had done wrong back here, which was good
 But still there's something wrong with the pride like there's something it still wasn't quite big and so I've seen there
 So I was kind of I don't know you guys like when you nail it like how else energy afterwards when I don't like I can
 just feel like this lack of energy we got it afterwards. I was like
 like it was good, but I still felt like this like like lack of energy and
 I felt this weirdness around like the pricing strategy and if you look the pricing was basically it was
 $2,000 to do the online version or 15,000 to online plus come to Boise plus get fill your funnel bunch other really cool things
 and it was just like it was kind of calm there's complexity in it and
 And so we were talking about when we open a payment plan
 I hate payment plans and all sorts of stuff and then then I had this idea as like wait a minute
 What if instead of a payment plan? What if and so this is a pricing strategy that?
 that turned this campaign from like
 The end of day two would probably like a hundred fifty thousand dollars in sales to two days later
 We'd over a million dollars in sales. What was the difference? It was that like this this was the piece that was like key
 I was pricing so we shifted this if you guys watched it I came out
 I said hey a lot of people asking for a payment plan unfortunately
 We don't have a payment plan, but I did decide to turn this coach your program into a $300 month one
 So you can come here it's $297 a month or you get lifetime access for $2,000 or you can upgrade to the 15,000 come to Boise
 And get all the other stuff as well and so what's interesting is like I know some of you guys my team are nervous like
 Oh, no if it goes $200 a month or $300 a month, you know
 Everyone's gonna take that it's gonna draw it and whatever was interesting is it we had people take that
 But what it did is come almost like a decoy offer where it made
 Everybody buy the $2,000 offer it's crazy tons of you about to like
 suddenly $2,000 in cheap versus $300 a month and
 It was cool for two reasons one is it got people to buy that number two. It was cool because
 It got a whole two on two or three hundred dollar month
 Coaching program would as well which is like was one of my goals this year's how do I create a $300 month and to be honest
 It's a straight current is a $300 month thing Ryan's students got a little $300 month thing
 I was like I want a $300 month training program
 So kind of like forces to do that but the cool side effect is that created this really cool thing
 We're now $300 a month or it's lifetime access for two grand. It's like a huge discount there which pushed everyone to the two grand
 We had nurse all our supplements kind of similar the way that pricing was we had one bottle three bottles or four bottles
 And with a pricing strategy was you basically had to be a moron to buy one bottle
 Where like if you had any brains at all you buy the four bottles like it was it was it was like $80 a bottle
 It's like $40 a bottle if you get three like it was crazy, right?
 So like pushed everybody like the pricing pushed everybody to where we actually wanted them and by doing this it did that as well
 It helped me to do two goals one is build fill out 300 on a coaching program number two is push people
 What I actually wore on the do is just two thousand dollars, which was really really cool
 And now it's been fun people going through there and the training those who are going through it
 It's it's super in-depth and intense and crazy and amazing and
 It's getting me excited to watch what people are doing
 So that was something the breakdown basically last year is urgency and scarcity and that's a push over the million dollar mark
 And that's by the way million dollars collected a lot of people use
 Actually, I say this publicly that company basically bankrupts like yeah, there's a thing that we inside the industry called stomper math
 And stomper math there's a company called stomper that used to be launches like we did $18 million
 but it was like
 Not collected it was like if all the payment plans go through for the next five years
 Then we would have made 18 million or something crazy like that like I hate that like stomper math
 This was like a $10 million launch, but in in real math that we actually use not common core like real math
 We collected a million dollars and so after rebuilds stuff would be a lot higher
 So anyway, I thought it was kind of cool urgency and scarcity from this point forward and then getting the offer was basically the thing
 I wanted to sell wrapped in with you get the recordings of this
 excuse me other recordings ah I said a curse word you get the
 You get this this extra seekers masterclass course for free as well and so that's kind of it
 So those who were in the x or those who were in the two comical coaching program
 All the recordings of this are the members are you go back and you can watch them
 I highly recommend at least watching these first three
 These first three were probably some of the best presentations. I feel like I've ever given ever
 Really really proud of them and it'll help you implement
 Um the first three of those who are listening on it's uh, the you and expert creators this will offer the big domino like
 There's something about like the the training the way it works like it those trainings just i'm really proud of them. They turn out amazing
 Um, anyway, we probably will be trying to evergreen this funnel in the near future. I'm not sure exactly how to do it yet
 Um
 But in the future if you go to expert seekers masterclass.com it may be there the evergreen version
 We're basically an opt-in and then we'd have 24 hour countdowns. We've just disappeared after 24 hour
 I don't know. I'm figure that piece out yet, but we mean we may or may not try to do that in the future
 Um, but yeah, that was kind of the breakdown of how the campaign worked and it was a lot of fun
 um tons of reciprocity tons of just good will a lot of people weren't able to buy they still got tons of stuff from that
 and um
 What's been interesting in my business is as i'm watching this is the more that i give away
 It's it's it's people have success with the free stuff
 In fact, Dan Henry's one person said this specifically a bunch of other people said like I feel like I I owe you because they've made so much money from all the free stuff
 Like Dan, I remember joining your circle. It's like I feel like I owe you 25 grand while you already gave you something give it to you
 So I can like be in your circle, but I feel like I owe it to you anyway
 That's what I want to do. I want to give people like such good stuff
 They could run with it and and have success so much so in the future that like man
 I need to buy all the Russell stuff because I feel like I owe it to him
 So it's kind of a good spot to be and that's sometimes folks a lot more on um, that's kind of how the whole thing worked
 um, it was it was really really fun and enjoyable and um
 the big keys big key takeaways and one is just
 Giving and building this huge lot of reciprocity streaming live streaming is huge live stream to youtube and a facebook
 I think it all said that it was like a quarter million people had seen parts of this training or it might have been more than that
 Anyway, it was amazing
 Having an offer
 A really good offer with a really good pricey stretch behind it when Brendan comes out to his course later this year
 Um, I mean, I hope we will probably use this process to watch it
 Um, but watch what he how he structures his offers like I think that's the key of it
 Um, like he does he'll do this whole training and he'll be like hey experts academy my
 My thousand dollar course. I'll give you 50 discount. So you're 500 plus you get this for free like it's all about creating an irresistible like amazing offer
 Right and um, it took it took us a couple tries while this thing was happening tweaking our offer before it got right
 That's something why you understand is that um, like we're tweaking offers in the like as they're happening in the middle
 It's like ah, it's not working. It's not converting change it tweak this make and so like if your thing's not converting like
 Change the offer don't like uh didn't work
 Like if you were seeing the behind the scenes and I think probably filmed some behind the scenes of that for behind the scenes
 Funnock and tv show, but we're shifting and changing and modifying thing on the fly because like it's it's uh
 It's it's happening in real time and it's kind of crazy. And so uh, anyway, this was a really cool thing to kind of end the launch with
 Um, you know, I had an extra million dollars to the bottom line, which was cool
 Um, it helped us to figure out the right pricing strategy for long term when we do evergreen this
 Um, how to actually sell the coaching with the right messaging like forcing myself to do webinar live
 Help me figure out what was wrong in my webinar hook
 Then having me do a webinar I have to recap the whole thing gave me another deep ability
 Like to fix the things and know what to do when I make this thing an auto webinar to sell it the coaching program in the future
 Um, oh, this was a cool thing I learned it was awesome
 When you do a webinar, it means it's only worse in my market. I'm not sure
 Or I could business market by like doing a webinar and then the next day
 Showing them what you did
 Like that the second webinar made is more my the first so one cool thing i'm going to start doing is uh
 I think
 So my webinars is when somebody registers like hey if you watched to the end
 What i'm going to do is I will actually send an email with a breakdown where i'm going to show you behind the scenes
 What I'm going to show you the webinar funnel what we did
 I'm like you funnel hack what I just did
 We'll give you the share funnels the emails
 But like you have to watch the webinar to be able to get access to that and it should force people to consume the webinar
 Which will include crease cells and things like that
 So that was a really cool thing doing double webinar
 We do those back in the day at eight or nine years we used to double things like that
 We do one and then one right after I forgot about them and it was I think there's I think there's a correlation here
 Doing a double webinar and second webinar is like showing something but like just keeps closing cells
 Um, but it's a different presentation. So anyway, I'll test with that. All you guys know what we figured out
 Um figuring out your pricing strategy was big and anyway
 There's so many cool lessons from it. So hopefully you has watched it and you experienced it
 And they had a kind of chance to see behind the scenes of the numbers and the metrics the big takeaways and the big ahas that we learned along the way
 And uh, anyway, it was uh, it's pretty awesome. So hope it helps you guys
