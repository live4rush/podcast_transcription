 Hey, good morning everybody. This is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast
 Today, I'm gonna share with you something that I'm really excited about and something. It's not completely finished yet
 This is the project we've been working on for
 probably a year or two now. We've just had a couple hiccups come up along the way
 But it's a it's a company
 I'm creating and launching called understand.me and it's all about understanding yourself better understanding your teammates better understanding your employees understanding your
 Coaching clients understanding everybody better right and all has to do with personality profiling and a bunch of other stuff
 And so without spoiling the surprise what's gonna be happening in the company
 We did last year do a summit where we interviewed a whole bunch of experts on different
 personality profiles and different different tests like the Enneagram and five love languages and disc and
 Myers Briggs and a whole bunch of other ones, right and after we did the entire summit
 Mandy and Mike who are the hosts of the summit who are some of my close friends awesome people
 They asked if I would be honest on the summit as well and
 But more specifically instead me showing them here's how like one test works
 It was more like explain how you're using testing in your life in your business to hire people build teams all that kind of stuff
 And so this interview is really fun because it goes into different tests different things
 And I think I think you guys really enjoy it if you've been if you've done personally profiling the past
 You're probably like me and you love them and you're obsessed with them
 And so this was giving more fuel for the fire and if you've never done before I'm hoping this will
 Spark something get you excited because there are so many
 Just so many cool things you can learn you can do when you understand these tools and so with that said we're in cute
 The theme song we come back. I have a chance to hear
 Mike and Mandy interviewing me about how we use personality
 tests to
 Hire people and build our teams and do a bunch of other cool stuff. So that said, thanks you guys and I hope you enjoy this episode
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hi everyone Mike and Mandy here. We're so excited to be interviewing Russell Brunson
 This is a big deal. This is a special interview
 So we're gonna be interviewing Russell on his vision for understand up me
 We wouldn't be here the summit wouldn't exist without this man
 So this is a special interview and for those of you who don't know Russell. He's got an amazing background
 So I'm gonna share with you a little bit about this man
 He first started his online company while he was wrestling in college within a year of graduation
 He had sold over a million dollars of his own product and services from his basement
 I mean, that's what we did when we were in college. Right? Same thing same story, you know
 We could all relate over the past 19 years. This is a big deal
 This makes me excited this new York Times best-selling author new York Times like if you guys know like that is not easy to accomplish
 He has built over a following of over a million entrepreneurs sold hundreds of thousands of copies of his books
 Popular popular lies the concept of sales funnel. So if you heard that term sales funnels
 It's because of this man right here and he co-founded the software company called click funnels
 which has helped over a hundred thousand entrepreneurs to quickly get their message out to the marketing place and
 On a personal note Mike and I feel
 so fortunate to know you and we know we've known Russell for over 10 years and
 I would like to say what's even more impressive than all these amazing
 accomplishments is
 This man has such a good heart and he really cares about people
 And so that's why we said yes when he invited us to be a part of this
 And so we're super excited to have you here
 Thank you for making the time to share with everyone about what you've learned with assessments
 And what inspired you to create understand on me?
 No, where is I'm excited to be here and excited talk about this kind of the first time I actually publicly talked about this kind of stuff at all
 So I'm excited to be so fun. Yes
 So you're you're really the the visionary behind understand on me and and the just the idea the concept of combining all the
 Assessments into one. How did you come up with that and what inspired you to do that?
 Yeah
 So the real story actually the first person ever introduced me to any kind of assessment was Mandy
 She was like hey something's wrong with you should take this test
 And so she got me the disk test initially and it was really cool
 I took it sent Mandy the results and then came back and started telling about myself and I was like oh weird
 And it helped me to understand myself and a lot of things where I thought
 You know potentially were things that like I was dumb or I was slower didn't make something it made me not feel dumb
 I was like oh, that's just this is what I am this and why I'm not and it made me feel more comfortable
 To who I was initially was just me and then you started we had Mandy come and start helping people in our company and
 They start taking you and also I start understanding my relationships with other people better
 And it was like that became the next fascinating thing and then a little while later is when James P. Freel was like
 You need to take 16 personalities my ribs test and I was like I already got this come good
 He's like no take this one too
 I took that one it opened me up this whole new world of like all these things introverts extra vertices
 You know people open loops closed loops and thinkers feelers all these things I didn't know about and then I was like
 This is really cool. What else is there?
 And I found out love languages and any of them all these ones I started taking them and it was fun because I learned something different about
 Myself and each one but I would need people and be like okay
 I feel like what are you and like but then there's so many things I never really knew and I'd like try to I had a lot of
 Friends I'm like okay take these three tests real quick and they take them and that's like okay now
 I understand how to how to interact with you or things like that. I remember one day not too long ago
 I was thinking when to be cool if there was a place you could go and take all the tests and then be given like a page
 Which is like you know and this is kind of the long-term future of the company
 You guys will see that there'll be page you can create it's like Russell Brunson understand that me
 You know show me and in all my profiles like in in a glint I can see what I am or what you are other people are and
 I think for me it's just been such a useful tool to help me understand how to interact with people
 It's such a good tool for myself to understand myself
 My kids other things and so that's kind of why we decided to put this together and since you're the person who taught me about it initially
 I was brought you in and love how Mike as well. So well
 We are we are honored and we love it because we are assessment geeks as well
 And it has helped our lives so much and so we thank you for having this vision if
 You don't mind sharing with everyone and this is a little bit more personal as far as like what was your disc results?
 and what what either surprised you or you know
 You found really helpful like oh no wonder I struggle with people who are maybe even different or no wonder I'm that way
 Like what did you learn about yourself when you took the desk? Yeah, so many cool things one of them was I'm so
 Those one though. I am a high-D high-I high-S no see at all
 Yeah, and I it's funny my mommy's tell me as a kid like you are the dirtiest kid
 I've ever seen in my life you can never clean up your room and I was like I just I don't even see it
 I don't even notice it right in a school I can never get through school and all the papers and the homework
 I couldn't do and like I always I was dumb growing up and even in business like I was really bad at organizing things and like
 Like it's always frustrating me. I think finding out that was a low C and like that's okay
 We'll talk about Slater like since I found life I surround myself people are high C's like like like work with them
 It works really well
 But like that something where I when I took that off me like you're not dumb
 You're just that's not you're not gonna be something just gonna be super organized
 So quit trying to like because the best organization in the world because you're not like it's just not gonna make sense to you
 Yeah, and that was a big thing also for me. I have a high D and a high S
 Which like they counteract each other?
 Yes, and I have time we were talking about before we started recording
 I got tons of internal turmoil about this
 I'm like the D
 He wants like drive get things done
 And then I'm the the S who's super faithful and nice and one of her new ones the feelings and so I have this weird thing where I
 In business situations or things are like I want to yell somebody but I can't so I'm too nice
 It's just like frustrating. I have his internal turmoil, but least I understand it out. I'm like, okay in this situation
 I need to I got to be a driver or in the situation
 I need to have more empathy or whatever I can that kind of start switching now
 I'm aware of as opposed to sitting here tight up and a knot like just like I don't know what to do
 You know and so those some of the things that kind of help also
 On the values what I thought was super powerful for me one of the most the biggest aha's for me was my biggest value is
 Is the economics which you told me it meant ROI like I'm left to have a return on investment
 And I realized that myself like the things that I've succeeded with in life for things that I can see that the ROI like
 When I was a wrestler like I looked away
 I ran I did all these things that I could see the ROI if I can see the ROI was really hard
 And so as I've wanted to do new things my life where I I knew there's something I wanted to do
 But it's hard to see the ROI like for example, I wanted in my religion. I want to read more scriptures
 But it's hard here morning you wake up and you read it like I don't see a tangible ROI every single day
 It was hard and so for me
 I was like I need to figure out a way to tie it an ROI to this so that it'll make me want to keep doing it
 So I was like, okay
 Well, if I want to podcast on what I'm learning then I do I'm gonna learn that I'm gonna record a podcast
 There's Go Says somewhere I'll see people listening to it and then now there's an ROI
 And also now it's like oh now there's a reason we do this because I got a published episode
 It's gonna help people and like it switched in my head
 Now I could start pursuing that thing and so I try to trick myself now like what's the ROI and making sure there's
 Tans with ROIs on things to motivate myself to do things I'm not typically motivated by it
 So that's kind of a couple of cool things I learned from my disc
 Oh, I love how you implemented it
 That's such a great example of of how you've implemented it personally
 Can you talk about I know that before understand me you use disc primarily for a while and
 Could you talk about applying disc in your company ClickFunnels and what's been the biggest benefit there?
 Yeah, what's actually interesting is most of our hires nowadays happen from personality profiling
 This is because of Andy because I almost made a really bad mistake
 So I was looking for a new position and if somebody it was in a position that's like the yin yang at me
 Right somebody who just be super organized things like that. So I sent out
 a bunch of applications we got hundreds people applying going through it all I think my top 10 of like
 Oh, these are the people and I had people submit video applications
 So I saw them pitching me on why they be the best person for this role and and I was so excited
 I broke down my top 10 and I was like can't figure out these people also. I'm so amazing
 So I was like let me send it to Mandy and like and tell you'll give me your feedback and
 First thing he says like we'll get their disc profiles. We got this profile sent to Mandy
 She looked all of them. She's like oh you hate all these people like what do you mean like I hung out like I talked
 They're all like I will hang out these guys every single day. They'd be so much fun. She's like that's the problem
 You're gonna hire someone just like you you're not looking for someone like you
 You're looking for somebody to to compliment you like the opposite
 You need someone who's high as high C because that's what's gonna be faithful
 They'll be super organized and they're gonna take the message you create and actually organize it
 And I was like oh and I look back through all the people and none of them like all of them are high
 Dehigh so like I love them because they're like me and they had great, you know selling you know
 And that's why I liked him and I was like dang it so I went back to all our applications and
 We had everyone go back retake the disc and said okay
 Just send me the applications of people that are high S high C
 And we got them all back and we looked at it and based on not them pitching you know why their best position
 But based on that on the personality profile we found a couple candidates and from there
 We hired someone and that person has been now with me three or four years
 Probably one of my favorite people we've ever hired ever and it came off of me hiring the person who had the right personality match
 Not not the person who sold me the best right and that was a big a hot
 So now it's been interesting as we look for new new positions the question is not like what's the resume look like whatever
 It's like what's the personality that fits the job description we're looking for we have people who will take the personality
 Profile send it to us and if they match that then we go back time send us a resume
 And then we'll talk to them
 But we make sure that we save ourselves so much time and effort energy
 Finding someone who's who's most likely to be successful in the role that we're looking for them to be in anyway
 See it makes such a big difference and I love what I love about working with you is you're so coachable
 You were like I know I've bursted your bubble and you're like I'm so excited
 You know, but something that I admire what you've done with ClickFunnels is you being a low C
 And what I've noticed coaching so many high D's
 Business owners they tend to do what you wanted to do
 Which is they hire a lot of people who are like them and then that inevitably creates a chaotic environment because like you said
 It's messy, right?
 You don't have that high C, but you didn't do that like when we did the disc training and we broke down like your executive team
 And you know Melanie your right arm Todd co-founder of ClickFunnels high C
 Like and most of your executive team has that C
 How has disc helped you with working with people who are different than you and like you knowing like because you're such a low C
 And then you got these high C's like what what's that experience been like and you know, what advice would you give other?
 Let's say low C's who are watching this working with other high C's. Yeah, it's interesting. I had someone
 A mentor is in the Alex Mendoza and way when I first got started on the 15 years ago
 And when I was getting started and I was you know just running a million miles a minute trying all these things
 And I had a moment with him
 And he told me something that stuck with me said he said there's two types of people in this world
 Those people who are starters and people who are finishers
 He says you have to figure out which one you are and surround yourself with the other people and I didn't know how that sink to disc or anything at
 Time I just I just understood that so I usually get starting chaos and starting stuff
 And then I'd be like you're juggling these balls. I'm like, ah, and I was just like and I see my like the first early companies
 We're all explode because it was me juggling all these things I could handle and boom, which is explode, right?
 And when he told me that I was like, okay, I gotta find finishers
 I know that man, but I just knew is people who who weren't
 Exactly like me right people who could like when the chaos happens
 They can take it and then like calm it down and like put it in put it in an order. What's like there?
 And now it's good and so I remember
 About time I was starting my speaking career
 I had a couple people that I brought on who again
 They were who I thought would be finishers and I would come I'd cut on stage speaking and I'd be speaking about something
 I'd sell something I promise things and he'd be in the back of the room
 Just taking notes on everything Russell promised to make sure that we could deliver on it because I'm just saying stuff
 I don't remember and then we get done. He's like, okay
 I'm gonna go do all this stuff now to get all this stuff put together the way you just promised people and so I was kind of the first
 the first crack application when I started seeing it and
 So like yeah, they used to kind of intuitively I started hiring a lot of people like not knowing
 Anything about pro personality profiles, but when the very first time you did the training with our team
 You had everybody take it. It was so fascinating to see that for the most part
 You know where I was high high D high I s almost everyone I had were high S's and C's around me
 People who were super faithful super organized and they were my finishers, right?
 I'm a good starter and I need a lot of finishers to help finish the things and it's funny because I was just consulting a company recently
 Who again?
 Whole bunch of high D high I guys who were like aggressive making much money how much stuff and on the outside
 You're like these guys are so successful and then like when you get into the private room with them
 And there's like our lives are a mess like I have no idea
 I'm gonna do and and I asked them the same question like have you taken this like yeah?
 I'm like what are you and they're like all we're the drivers and they're also much you have any SC's around you
 They're like no like like this is like the root of all your problems right now
 You're creating chaos and there's nobody to fit it like your starters. You're not finishers
 you finishers or else this thing you may make a bunch of money for a little while but never it's not gonna last long term and
 And so it's been interesting watching people then come back and same thing now
 They're like okay
 I need finishers and the S's C's I need these people and try to find them and
 Involves the other side of people come to our world and they're they want to be entrepreneurial and they're coming in and they're just like
 Lazyly just doodling around and they're they're really you know
 They're their their Google sheets are all organized and their stuff's all perfect, but they can't make anybody
 We have a friend who's a naturopath who's sending like great guy very organized
 But his business isn't growing because there's not a D in there
 Who's just gonna go and take the thing over and I have a lot of times
 I've come to people like that and say look you need to find a high D Hi
 I wants to go sell and do things like Todd Dickerson who built click funnels
 Smartest human I've ever met in my life if it was just him click phones
 Would would he be coding on it be getting better and better and better but no no about it
 He had me as the high D Hi
 I was coming out here yelling about screaming freaking out excited and that he's the S's and C like creating the things that we're doing
 And without like one without the other never would have worked and he had to have that both both things so things understanding that and being okay with like okay
 It's not me even gonna be an all starts like how do I build my venture team of people the people I need around me to support me
 So I can actually do the thing we need to do. Mm-hmm. I love that
 I love how you broke down like the benefits and how you've used it in building such a successful company like click funnels
 So what do you?
 What do you see as far as the future of understand.me like these are incredible examples of how you've used
 assessments in business and then people that you've mentored have used assessments in their business
 What about just like life in general and like how do you see people using understand.me to see all of their profiles in one place?
 How could they use that in different aspects of their life? Yeah, I was joking
 My friends I was like imagine if you were you know, I've been married now for 18 years
 So I don't know how it all works
 But you know you're on the app swipe left I swipe left or whatever or you asked my daily before head
 I'm ahead of time be like hey, can you fellas per like go fill this thing out and let me know about you ahead of time
 They give you the profile and you're like our love language
 Don't match there's like you could know
 Like you'd save yourself so much time energy if you could see those things
 So you need a job interview if you're like hiring people so my goal is to with understand
 I'm used to give it so that if I'm hiring someone the first step is like hey before I look at any resumes go
 For that profile and send us your link we can look at it in a brief thing like look
 You don't fit for this
 But we are looking for someone in this role which you you fit you if it really well here things like that or if I'm dating somebody
 Like let me go look at your profile like oh, there's a good shot. We're gonna be a good natter
 It's like I've hated I've dated high-dees in the past and didn't work out like I don't want to you know
 Whatever that thing might be
 I just think it's gonna help you know first off again the first goal is help you understand yourself in the second office
 Just all of our interactions and it could be you know times have to work together relationships like so many different things
 I think it's just gonna be a tool. It's gonna help
 So people connect and understand each other better right now, especially the time of the world we might now have so much
 Understanding everyone is angry and fighting and there's there's this thing I think that
 My personally if I think the most every not everybody but most everybody does things out of good intentions and
 But they said there's viewing the world through completely different lenses
 And I think that we always think no how you not see this like this is the world. It's like yeah, but
 But that's the world you see because they because these personally profiles if you look at it from different lenses like the world
 It's completely different and so it gives you more empathy for other people and more understanding just understanding like hey
 They have good intentions. They're trying their best
 I look at things differently and maybe maybe I'm wrong maybe they're right maybe vice versa, but it gives you more
 Ability to to work well with people and hopefully this will be a tool that helps bridge those gaps makes us with people can work better
 Have better relationships and be happier
 Well, we know that it's it's helped us in our friendship and it's what's interesting is interviewing all these experts
 You know, I've known this man for 25 years. I thought I knew everything about him
 But like diving deeper into some of these assessments. I'm like oh
 That's what you do that drives me nuts or like me too like you're like oh no wonder you do
 It's it's like any I find that any time I judge it's because I don't understand and
 Like that is what you know the awareness of the assessments
 You know do if if you don't mind sharing with everyone
 You know you mentioned Todd and he's so different than you but you guys have been like, you know
 He's like your you know, you're your partner in in click funnels and it's like a marriage
 You know a professional marriage you guys have worked so closely together late nights early mornings and you're so different
 How has like understanding that how he's different?
 How has that helped you maybe resolve conflict or be able to to get through some hard times because I
 Find and coaching people people tend to like people who are like them
 Right and we're comfortable with people who are like us
 But you have like gone down this road with Todd who's very different than you what advice would you give people who are partnering or working with people?
 Who are so different than them? Yeah, one thing is understanding that each of the each of the different things is like
 It's own unique superpower, which is cool and Todd and I just described very different
 But if look at our our 16 personalities are very similar actually the only difference is that I'm a feeler
 And he's a thinker and at first we had some clash, you know, no, this is how I feel is like
 No, this is what I think and first it was we clash on that but then over over time
 We got such a deep respect for both of each other that I was like man if Todd's thinking something he like he's he's really
 Smart so I trust his thinking and he's also meant to be like hey Russell's feeling this
 I trust his intuition and so a lot of times when we have arguments I think arguments we have a thing coming up
 All of a sudden the mess that I use boxer so I'll box him on my hey Todd
 So this is what I'm feeling and I'll explain what I'm feeling
 I said I want to know what you're thinking he'll my fact
 This is what I'm thinking and he'll tell me he's thinking and then we look at that lens like hey
 This is what I'm feeling so he's thinking like do they sink or they opposite and we can we can kind of go back that
 What's nice is that after he think he tells me he thinks oh?
 I have a feeling based on that again
 So it's like based on his his new the new data that he's brought to the world
 I would have never seen anyway like my things will shift sometimes like oh my gosh like you're actually right
 I miss this or vice versa where he'll come in and like tell me this and I feel this and he's like ah
 I don't see it
 But like man I trust your intuition if you feel like that's the right thing then let's try it
 And so it's it's been really cool because it's it's it's like it checks in the balances between us
 Because I think if every decision I had like I felt the thing I went for every single time we probably like misfired way like
 Yeah, in fact, I think it's something as far as we had it were definitely because I felt something that I would end up being wrong on right
 But it's just nice. It's nice checks and balance. It's been
 Super helpful. So I think it's understanding that if you have a partner and just like understanding like I my superpowers feeling
 You're just thinking with don't like use these as like two battling things against each other
 But respect each other and like use it as like hey this is what I'm feeling is what you're thinking you know things like that
 The other one that's been been interesting. I mean this one's not so much with me and Todd
 But just me and meetings I struggled with I can't remember what what it is inside of something
 Personalities, but it's talking about like someone who opens loops or somebody who closes loops. Oh, so you're the you're the P like you
 Yeah, and it's the J. So the P like Melanie and I we like to close
 Yeah, so there's two kinds of people here
 So loop openers like me like I have the open loops and like visualize and talk about the future all these things like this
 It's like yeah, and what's crazy in your meeting with like 50 people that work for you and you're talking these things and they're all loop
 Closures, they're like, okay, how many how many freaking I how many clothes down that and then they come out and they've that meetings
 And they're freaking about every single thing you said like and here's like stop. I got it like
 This is not close yet. This is open and like I cannot tell you
 This is years of people hating me and I hating people because you're like
 I don't want to share my ideas because you're just like God just ran in my parade and all these things and then and they're freaking out
 Like don't tell me your ideas like we're trying to close these other loops you open in like and as soon as I we took 16
 Personalities and I learned that as a tool. It's like there's loop open loop closers. I was like oh my gosh like I
 Am driving people crazy like me opening loop is not me asking the clothes loop
 It's me brainstorming and visualizing and dreaming right and so I had a like we have meetings
 I think hey guys, I'm gonna open a loop real quick your job is not to close
 It's just to see here in the space. Let me open it. Oh, okay, so they're like putting the old pad and paper down
 Like so we're not doing anything like no like nothing is allowed to be done right now
 I'm opening loop and we're just gonna go with it
 So I sit down we open and it's just like I talk forever
 And you see my itching like they want to like
 At the end of it, I'm like they'll ask me a question like I'm already closed loop yet
 And they're like okay, I'm like I'll tell you I'm ready close loop
 And then they they have this permission to like not stress out and like okay, and then they come to me a day later to his later
 Like hey, we're very close this loop yet. I'm like no, not yet. Okay. Can I play a cool this loop yet?
 Like yeah, I'm ready close it
 I thought through in my head enough and I realized what's gonna happen
 I'll close the loop and then they close it and then they're fine
 But it's given us this like this tool we can use when we're doing meetings communicating where I'm not driving them crazy
 They're driving me crazy
 And it's been it's been such a powerful thing like you can see the little tiny things these are understanding like my superpowers
 Visualizing and daydreaming and all these kind of things, but it's like kryptonite for them and vice versa
 But if you use both tools together man, it's so powerful some of them ready close the loop
 I got a whole bunch of people like okay, let's close these loops and they're running and they're putting things together organizing and all this is happening
 That wouldn't happen. Otherwise savages daydream forever. So it's kind of interesting right there you train your team like to understand loops
 Like you you don't have to necessarily because I think sometimes especially people who are watching this
 You know can get overwhelmed with like learning all these assessments
 But what I love that you did it's like you didn't give like an assessment presentation to your team
 You just talked to them about how yeah the one thing like I open loops
 I know you close loops and it's like you train them on that so now they understand you so they're not gonna hate you because they
 Understand you and then they're gonna understand themselves like okay now. I know why I'm itching to do it. That's that's so great
 You know one of the things I found to be so invaluable in these assessments in coaching is
 Helping people understand what they need to recharge because you know we're not we're not taught and we're so different
 It's like what you need to recharge can be very different than what I need to recharge and I find that sometimes there's guilt and shame tied to that
 Right because it's like I wish I was like this person and we compare ourselves and in coaching
 I do my best to influence high D's in this very busy culture and like you're super busy next time bestseller
 Like multi-million dollar company you you know have so much going on in your plate at your very high D
 Can you share how making time to do physical vigorous activity like what that's done for you and like the benefits of you learning
 Like what we've gone over and what you need to recharge so that you can be able to get all of this done
 Yeah, it's interesting too because I've now seen one of my sons
 He's 10 years old and he is very introverted and he has friends come over because he's super cool kid
 Everyone loves him
 So everyone's come play with aid and they're coming over the plane of them and like I see his friends leave
 And he's just like dad tomorrow. Can you tell all my friends? I can't play like why he's like I just need to just
 I just want a day to myself
 I just need to be and so like and I see with him which I never knows myself because I same way like I was so guilty of like
 Why am I not normal like everyone wants to go do things and we all this kind of stuff and it was really it was really hard for me
 Especially you know as a marketer. I'm going to these networking events and stuff
 I was networking and talking and I'm just like not feeling comfortable and like and like and then I'm just like
 Oh, I want to die like this is like why am I like subjecting myself to this?
 You know and understanding for me as an introvert like and people don't believe me like you know introvert because you're on stage talking
 or ever
 But it's like it's not that's not introvert extra for me. It's right. It's like how you recharge and so for me
 It was like understanding like okay
 I need to go do this thing I'm gonna go down and network with people but I'm gonna leave early
 I'm not going all my long and partying and playing like at 10 o'clock or 11 whenever
 I'm going back to the room and I'm just gonna go watch TV like I need to just watch TV or I'm gonna hit the
 Wait Room in the mornings. I just need like I get the get the nervous the thing out of me
 So I can like be present again the next the next day otherwise
 I don't know if you're the same way, but like if I don't do that next morning. I sit in bed and I'm just like
 I don't want to leave
 I don't like it's still in there so much that you can't go back out and do the things you need to do right?
 And I have no side events before I'm sitting in a hotel and I'm like I just can't leave like I'm not
 I don't have the energy to go out or somebody's even at the office
 I'm like I can't go into a group of people because like I haven't recharged yet
 So if I'm not careful about that and making sure that either in the morning or not somewhere I'm recharging
 It's hard to come back sometimes to war and get in the mix of all the people and do what you need to do
 So you can be aware of that of what it is
 But then you know other side we've got other partners who are very extroverted who you know like they they go network
 And then they got seeing karaoke till four in the morning and then they're like taking over back in there the coffee place
 Or whatever and they'll sleep all night and it's like yeah, if I fall asleep
 I'm not gonna be recharged like I don't understand that but that's there their path
 And it's just like understanding that respecting each other and and doing the things you need for yourself
 You know what I love about these assessments and about understand.me is just
 that you become more conscious and aware of
 what you need right or what other people need and I love those stories about you talking with your business partners or
 other people in your life and just literally saying like okay, this is my you know
 I'm opening a loop or or like like we do it to each other now like okay
 This is my type 7 anyagram coming out or like you know
 Mandy will say I need to bring up my type 8 and being more of a challenger like it's just interesting like
 Life really changes right when you become more conscious and aware
 And that's why I'm so excited about understand.me
 Can you talk a little bit about your vision of how you see this really changing people's lives by becoming more aware
 and conscious of these things. Yeah, I think it's true in all parts of what I think about like
 I think about you know as a as a kid
 I was an athlete so I I could even ever want because I'm working out a million times a day
 And it was fine and then I got done and really quick after I stopped wrestling. I ended my career
 I gained a ton of weight and I was like what what's wrong like I'm doing what I was doing before but now I'm like
 You know I gained like 50 or 60 pounds and it's very short period time
 I just like it doesn't make sense and took me years to become aware of what I was actually doing right
 And they're like oh my gosh you're eating 6,000 calories a day like I didn't know that but before I was burning 6,000 calories
 Days was fine
 But when I stopped and I was like you become aware of it when you can wear it then you can change and you can tweak things
 So many times in all of our lives. We're never aware of stuff, right? We're just we plug in we're doing the thing
 We're doing the thing and like sometimes good things happen sometimes bad things happen we're not ever aware of it
 Sometimes relationships work sometimes they don't sometimes we're happy since we're sad
 We don't know why and I think the more awareness to bring that we that we have
 The more we can affect things right when I understood weight and eating and calories and all these things I was like oh
 Well, that's why I'm not that's why I feel this way
 That's why I'm gaining weight and I sort of shift some things I was aware of it and it's really easy to draw the weight again like oh
 That was easy, you know like I'm not getting along with my spouse or my business partner my person
 And it's like oh why is this not working then you figure out how to like you come aware of it and then you make the shifts and the changes
 And I'll say oh this is actually really easy to do it's just becoming aware of it
 I think most people unfortunately live their lives without any awareness of most things
 They're just drifting and wandering and kind of out there
 And so I think if this project what we're doing to bring people more awareness is going to make people happier
 It's going to make them feel more confident more secure like more happy with themselves more okay with themselves
 And then you know make their relationship so much better at the same time. So that's my big vision for I think it's going to make everybody just
 I don't understand like that's that's the goal understand yourself and understand other people
 Well, I think it's really going to change things because it's a place for not only for you to understand yourself
 But to share it with the whole world like that's the big difference
 You know these tools have been around for a while
 But there's been no place where you can store it like all those things to become aware of and conscious of for yourself and others
 To store it and then share it with others and interact
 I think it's going to change people's interactions and daily lives and the way they do things
 So thank you so much for coming up with this idea and it'll be to taking some walks up to you like wait
 Before you bring yourself like what's your understanding of me profile like oh cool. Yeah, we can be friends
 I know I'm like am I going to turn into one of those people where I'm like, yeah, so I'm going out to dinner with who?
 Okay, can they take this first because this is just going to cut so much time and then I can decide if I want to go to dinner
 No
 But really you it's like I find that we learn this from another friend of ours
 That the more you know about someone the more you tend to love them
 And I find that like what's happening right now in the world today is we're we don't know about each other and like you said
 We don't understand the way that they're looking at the world
 um one of the things I've really admired about
 One of your superpowers. I don't think a lot of people know about unless they're really involved with the click funnel community
 Is you're an incredible mentor for other entrepreneurs and you have an incredible ability to see why they're stuck and to be able to help them
 You know
 Grow their business and that's why when they find out about you and they find out about this superpower
 Everyone wants like Russell help me show me how to help, you know grow my business. Why am I stuck?
 What am I doing? How do you see assessments specifically with helping entrepreneurs and business owners?
 Oh, yeah, I wish I would have known these things
 Years ago and you know like right now, you know you helped coach in a circle for years
 Which was you know half the time they're coming in for marketing help and they spend more of the time like I'm like
 Oh, that's why I'm doing that my company's failing because I don't have anyone who's a high C
 You could actually help me, you know all these all those kind of pieces that they're missing
 I think that the biggest the biggest thing with with that like again if I
 You know moving forward, I would make sure every entrepreneur had to I worked with had a chance to go through this
 We could see their their stuff ahead of time as well as their teams because you can see really quickly
 Oh, there's the gap in your team the reason why is you have no driver the reason why you're you're stuck at this level
 Or you got a whole bunch of drivers the reason why you're stuck is because you're fulfillment's horrible because everyone's falling off the vac
 You know or but it'd be really easy. I mean just like nowadays we hire based on personnel
 We don't hire based on a resume. You do the same thing
 I I think if you look at team dynamics and you look at somebody's like their team and look in their profiles
 You can see really quickly where the gaps are like, you know, look at that
 It'd be fun to do that as an experiment. I just look at the teams
 The team dynamics with just the things and then come back and like my guess is you were probably struggling here here here. Am I right?
 How did you know it's like because you're missing?
 Yeah, it's like the Avengers like if they didn't have Hulk
 They would have lost because Hulk's gonna look through this piece of the puzzle right and like Hulk's out
 Like they're gonna struggle or Ironman or like and it's just like if you can't build the Avengers team
 If you're missing one of the superheroes and so this will help you see the identify where the things are so you can fit the gaps
 But it'd be a really interesting thing to do
 I think a lot of times we found that out intuitively when we were coaching and walking through the process and it took a while to get there
 Where we could get there really quickly and just like oh, there's your team. Yeah, that's why you're struggling
 I love how you bring everything back to the Avengers team. Yeah, I've had a remarkable ability to do that. I love it. It's important. Yeah
 Perfect. Well, thank you so much for doing this interview for coming up with the idea
 We still look forward to using it in our lives and helping other people use it in their lives and their businesses
 And I think it's gonna really be a game changer. So thank you so much. Yeah, no worries. Hope everybody loves this stuff
 You know, I know it's helped me and you guys so much in your life. Hopefully it helps everybody else as well to help understand themselves and the people that they love
 Perfect does. Thank you. Thank you so much
