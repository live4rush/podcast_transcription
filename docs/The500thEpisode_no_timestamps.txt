 What's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson and welcome to the 500th episode of the marketing secrets podcast
 I cannot believe we're an episode 500
 Excited to be hanging out the guys here today and I'm gonna talk about my future my plans where I'm working on and a
 bunch of other cool stuff
 So that said let's cue up a theme song and we come back. We're gonna hang it out having some fun here inside of my private library
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, I can't believe it's been 500 episodes. That's just the marketing secrets podcast prior to that
 We had the mark in your car podcast, which was like probably another three or four hundreds were probably close to a thousand
 Podcasts episodes since I started this crazy journey
 Almost a decade ago. It was after some of you guys know the story
 We had built a big company up and we're on top of the world and the whole thing crashed and crumbled and moved from a huge
 You know 20,000 square foot building down to a little tiny 2,000 square foot building
 And for some reason I had this impression that hey, you should start a podcast right now talking about your marketing
 I was like, this is the worst possible time. I literally
 basically just went
 bankrupt and the whole thing went apart like this is the worst possible time I could do this and
 For some reason I was supposed to do it
 So I started and started publishing and I started talking and I started sharing what we're working on even though
 They were ups and they were downs if any of you guys go back to the old marketing
 In your car podcast episodes in fact, oh, we just got so sorry I digress
 marketing seekers calm is the
 Is basically my the brand new funnel hub we created on clickfulness 2.0. It's the first ever click on a super
 No site ever
 So if you go to marketing seekers calm you can see it
 But yeah on there if you click on the podcast tab it shows you obviously this podcast you can subscribe to but we also have links for
 The original marketing your car podcasts all of the old episodes are back live you can go back and binge listen to if you want
 So I recommend doing it because it's really fun
 But back then I remember like what episode I did was like only morons
 We want to make more than ten million dollars a year like all these are my you should never try to make that a goal
 Anyway, it's just funny now because yeah, just how my shift my ideas and belief things shifted along the way
 But it's a whole fun journey and like we're talking about ideas like oh
 We have this new project working on think it's gonna change the world and it was click fun
 Well, you know, I'm like it's just a crazy journey going back and thinking through all those kind of things
 So yeah, now we're after running after you know 300 whatever episodes
 We decided to to rebrand and call the marketing seekers podcast and now here we are 500 episodes later
 Which is insane so thank you for listening if you have if you missed any of them
 Make sure you begin at the beginning and binge listen to all of them
 I've tried to make them all entertaining and good, but also sure enough that you know like Joe Rogan for example
 I loved Joe Rogan
 I think he's awesome and I love listening his podcast more
 But first off each episode's like four hours long and then there's so many of like it would take me the entirety of my life to catch up
 Where you guys could catch up?
 You know within a couple months if you just listened, you know a couple of a day
 So there you go go back and binge listen
 but
 I'm here today in my makeshift library
 And we were saying what do you mean to make shift library why in the last?
 and four or five months have
 Purchased I'd say conservatively probably three to four thousand books
 And I am in the process of building an actual huge library here in Boise, but right now we have a temporary
 Office who rented where I'm storing all these books
 And I'm working on some really cool projects that you guys will see come into fruition over the next little bit, but
 You know it's interesting I
 Sumea saw I did I've done two consults with Tony Robbins we filmed and turned into YouTube videos
 So if you go to our YouTube channel and search for me you can see and we're basically I had chance to ask him a question
 And crazy enough I'm actually flying out next month do it again
 So I have a new time to ask him a question which I'm excited for but my first question was trying to figure out what to do with my life
 like build cool company clickphones which I do and
 You know should I step down should I sell the company?
 What should we do and 20 big things like well if you sell a company what's next and I was like
 Oh, no, like I love what I do is like then you shouldn't sell it like this is your passion
 This is your dream is like if you don't have the next thing you shouldn't
 Worry about this thing and so you know that and as well as a bunch of other advice really made me realize like I'm not
 You know, I don't want to sell the business on my plan, but then the question kept coming
 Well, what's next like what happens click phones with a crash or you do sell or it's like what's the next part of your mission?
 I didn't know that for so long
 um and
 It's interesting
 You know, you don't know where things are we go?
 It's just these for me
 I like when things get me excited I pursue those passions and hopefully it takes me in a cool spot in a cool direction
 And that's kind of what happened here. So some of you guys know I
 Started collecting old books
 The first one I bought was actually a first edition book of Mormon, which is super rare
 There was only 5,000 ever printed initially and only 350 left that people know of and so I bought one of those on eBay
 And that's my first old book and that was all I had and then fast-forward
 And probably four or five years later six years later. I got a random message on Facebook from a funnel hacker who's like hey
 don't you have a first-edition book of Mormon and
 You know, I don't respond all my messages that one. I'm like, yes, I do why and he was like hey
 there's this guy who he was here in Utah and he's
 Like the Indiana Jones of the Mormon church. He's got a whole bunch of old books
 Do you want to see all like see you have a whole bunch more like heck yeah?
 So the guy came up and he showed me you know
 All these other books like first edition book more also second third fourth fifth edition then first edition doctrine covenants and
 You know, this is for non-moments
 These books are but they're all like the the books that we look at a scripture that are like our favorite things and
 He had all these different books there
 And then the first edition doctrine covenants and Emma Smith hymnal all these things and book the commandments
 I started looking these things I was like these are so cool
 I don't know what it was
 But I felt this like pull towards them and so I started buying all these first edition books
 And that's how I started getting into this whole book thing
 And then I started you know start thinking like what do I do with these things and I want to display them and show them and
 You know so long story short down a whole mental
 Rollercoaster eventually I had they didn't want to build this library and in the library
 I would have different sections on the things I'm passionate about right so it'd be a business section a religion section a
 personal development section
 You know have these different sections and I was like would be cool is in the religion section
 I can show up my first edition books
 But then I was like okay
 Well in the personal development section of the business section like what would be cool things to show there?
 And I didn't even know if I started going to eBay and started searching for a few the authors
 I knew one of them was Napoleon Hill and
 I was looking you know
 I go to eBay I type in the I type in the author and then I always sort by highest price first
 Just like I say like what are the rare things the cool things and the top of it
 There was this first edition laws of success book series and it was
 Signed by him. It was three years before the first one was ever printed
 And so this is like his rough rough draft before everyone to actual publishers and things like that
 And there's only one of them on the planet. What happened is Napoleon Hill
 He he wrote the first version and he hand printed on his own printers
 I didn't get a school nearby printed these print printed these these books
 And then he sent him out to like the president of the United States and people are head of businesses and kings and queens
 And just personally mailed these to them as gifts to try get them to read his new book he wrote book series, right?
 and
 There's only one that we're aware of on the planet left. It's this one. I saw it
 I was like that would be the perfect piece for the for the future library for the personal development section
 um, but it was
 It was a lot of I can tell you guys how much but
 um, anyway, it was it was kind of insane and so I was like why can't buy that but I'm gonna start buying other things
 So started buying first-ition thinking garages and other things and
 Eventually after buying a bunch of different things one of the people I bought something from messages me and
 We started a conversation turned out he oh he was one who owned this first edition laws of success
 and he'd been collecting books for 20 years and so I
 You know started texting him back and forth and eventually
 I decided to buy his entire library his entire collection for 20 years. So I went out and flew out in a plane
 We got it all we brought it in
 um
 And then I had you know 20 year collection of these old books and most of them I didn't know who the authors were at these people were like
 They're all brand new to me
 So I in my office I laid them all out and I started like reading the books and going through them and
 um and started like figuring out who the people were and like who the authors were and like where they came from and
 And it started me down these rabbit holes and I started going to eBay like okay
 I find out an author like the guy who started a success magazine for example his name's Orson sweet marin
 And I had a couple of first editions
 Success magazine
 And I had this guy's name so I started going to eBay and searching out turns out sky wrote tons of books
 I went buying all the first editions of his books and then I found out his mentors kind of Samu smiles and I went bought all his books and then
 You know one of them pulling him magazines don't pull any he'll talks about this millionaire gave him this book
 And so I go to eBay and I find a first edition of that book and then anyway
 It's just kind of crazy to now where in the last three or four months I button
 I say between three and four thousand books here for the library. I'm gonna build someday, which is not being built yet. So
 But I got the books so we still got those
 But as I'm going through this it's been really really cool for me as also. I'm writing my very first personal velvet book
 Which has been such a fun process
 I basically wrote the whole thing and I decided I hated it. I deleted it all right in the middle of me buying all these books
 Now I've got literally the first editions of every personal velvet book ever written from 1850s till now
 And I'm having a chance to read them and go through them and find these different pieces and find things are similar and different and like
 It's been magical. If I like open to my eyes to
 Just growth in a way that was different than I ever had seen before
 um
 It's cool last week we're in mexico with our
 Um with the two comic club inner circle and category kings
 And I did my very first presentation my very first personal velvet presentation ever
 And it wasn't perfect in fact, I'd say probably a third of it
 I was like really really proud of it two thirds. I'm like, I didn't do it right. I didn't
 You know like just you know feeling which like it was good, but not like perfect, but part of it was great
 Um, my first session was like, oh so proud of what happened and what came out of it
 But it got me excited. It's like last night. I went to bed at like 11 o'clock night or something
 I couldn't sleep and I got up and I rewrote the table of contents for the new book and I wrote it out and
 um
 Oh, like I'm so excited now like I'm freaking out excited and now right now I'm at the library
 Walking in my old books and I'm organizing and putting them in categories and trying to find the right authors and trying to find these pieces and going deeper on these topics
 Um that people haven't talked about in a hundred years, but I've got all the books. I've got all the like everything
 uh from the beginning of
 This this movement in fact they called it the new thought movement
 Um this generation where people started thinking like hey if you think you can change your life and like what and what came from that
 These amazing authors and books and um anyway, so I'm here because again, I have 500 episodes into the marketing
 Secrets podcast. I still am obsessed with marketing and funnels and all the things but I've always told you and I tell everybody like I feel like
 I've been called to serve a certain group of people of entrepreneurs just like you have you've been called to serve your group and they're different than mine
 But we we just get called to serve a group of people right?
 So for me as entrepreneurs
 And the next thing is like well how do I help them?
 And so initially was like get they gotta understand funnels and they gotta send copy and storytelling they understand traffic
 They need software to do these things
 And while those things are now happening in their place or serving entrepreneurs like I feel like my next step in calling is
 Is bigger, which is like I need to develop these entrepreneurs
 Not just as business owners with people as humans help them to be able to do more and be more and so that's where i'm at
 So i'm 4,000 books deep into this new project to try to serve you guys at a different level
 And i'm excited because again, we have no plans to sell clickfattles do anything
 But now it's the least I know like if that went away or something happened like what's my next step like it's still serving the same audience
 It's just these are the new tools and the keys and the things I have not to help serve you guys at a different level
 Because I think the more the more you guys are able to
 Have the tools and the keys and the things you need to be
 Truly successful not just like the business tools like those we're going to continue to keep developing stuff
 But it's like the mindset the personal development the the things that
 That the greats of our time understood that we're that we're still trying to understand like that's what i'm trying to give to you
 So anyway, I mean side is this this 500
 You know episode mark to really be able to say that now like okay
 I do know what's I do know the rest of my lives gonna look like you know
 My plan is to build this library inside this library is to
 Go out and be able to bring these principles these philosophies back to you back from the dead and bring them to you guys and make
 You know hopefully extend the legacy of these authors
 For forever, but then also in the process hopefully extend my legacy. So
 I've been a weird like legacy driven spot in my life where I'm like, I just want
 I want 500 years from now some kid on ebay to be googling my name and finding old books that I published and finding even like being able to
 Use them to change his life and the next generation's life. Just like i'm trying to do right now like that's
 That's what i'm that's what i'm developing. That's what i'm trying to create. So
 Anyway, let's watch out with you guys. I'm excited. There's gonna be a lot of really cool opportunities for you as to be part of what we're doing here
 We're working on NFTs associated with the library. We're working on a bunch of cool things
 But I think it's gonna be a good magical. So anyway, we're gonna keep doing what we're doing now
 Click the most 2.0 is launching soon. We're gonna be amplifying everything on that side of the business
 And then on top of that it's coming back to like my true calling, which is you guys
 How do I serve you at the highest level and if it's through software it's through software
 It's your books or events or courses or whatever that thing is we like that's what i'm pursuing
 Because yeah, that's where i'm at. So anyway, I just wanted to say that. Thank you guys so much for listening
 Thank you for being part of this
 I hope for each of you that as you're listening to this you're start thinking about, you know a couple things like your legacy
 Where are you going? What are you trying to do next? You know, um figuring out how to develop yourself like
 Like one of their books because you're either the courses or the things could you go through to help
 Sharpen your saw and make you a better entrepreneur or better person
