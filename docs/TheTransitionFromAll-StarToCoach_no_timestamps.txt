 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing secrets podcast. I'm excited because today
 I'm gonna let you in behind the scenes of
 something that
 Made me a little vulnerable vulnerable that right word nervous
 But something has turned out to be really really good
 I think for a lot of you guys who are the all-stars and you were in the transition point to becoming the coach
 This is gonna be super valuable for you. So with that said, let's jump into this episode
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody. So like I said this episode is actually a voxer that I sent to
 my partners inside ClickFunnels and it was after I had a chance to spend a week with a whole bunch of amazing marketers and
 business owners and and
 kind of reflecting on on what's next for me. What's my next step my next role and
 Yeah, and I'm not gonna lie
 I was really nervous to first off to Vox those guys about it
 and then after I actually forwarded it to all the people on my traffic and funnel building team because
 it represents kind of a shift in focus for me personally and for them as well and
 For me it's just funny how nervous I was and like the vulnerability of like oh, this is the scary thing that I got to try to tackle but
 Doing so has been like one of the greatest things for our company
 I'm just getting excited now and seeing the vision and rebying in and
 The energy level since I kind of mentioned has been really really fun. And so I thought it'd be fun to share with you guys
 a couple real quick caveats is there some people I mentioned some people who are on the trip as well as some people who were
 You know just work internally inside of our team
 And so I'm gonna have my brother beep out those those names or mute out those names and some of the the confidential details
 So if you hear little blips of sound that's what those are but do not fear all the good stuff still in there for you
 But for anybody you guys who have been the all star in your transition to try becoming a coach
 Which is the phase of the business I'm in right now, and it's a nervous scary exciting
 Everything I hope that this this will give us some perspective and help you out and for those who aren't there yet
 But you're wondering like where am I going? What's the vision? What's the what's the future hold for me?
 Hopefully this help you as well. So that said let's jump right into this voxer
 And I hope you enjoy it. Hey, what's up guys? Hope you're doing awesome
 I want to kind of record
 This for you guys based on some my thoughts over the last
 probably two weeks or so to get a few back and then probably gonna forward this on to
 Like the funnel team and the traffic team just so they have some context as well
 But it's one of kind of put it in your first gear guys just thoughts on it. So
 Anyway, the last little bit has been really good for me. I had like some big
 personal aha's about stuff and
 Obviously, obviously we've done a lot of things right
 Because we've gotten where we are, but I think also
 I'm kind of just we're small. We're trying to figure out what my next step is and all kinds of stuff
 So anyway, I sharpens that was really good
 So they get help me understand a lot better like the team building in how to do meetings how to structure things and just it was
 It was really really good
 But even with that still I was kind of like with this weird like uneasiness. So when I was at the event
 I also made my cars not too loud
 So loud and a drive anyway, when I went to that to the mastermind group and we were with those guys up at the
 the travel ranch or whatever and
 We do all the manly things like fishing and shooting and things. I'm really bad at
 Then we find out a mastermind together and kind of talking it's funny because normally mastermind groups obviously are like share marketing
 It is but this one was like more like a men's group was like self-help but just self-help guru
 So we were talking marketing they were talking like, you know how to make yourself happier
 But anyway, they got to my turn they asked like one of my biggest
 struggle was I needed help with from the group and what I told them is basically I said, you know my whole life
 I've always had like something I was running towards right. So like when I was
 When I was a wrestler like
 So then when I was wrestling I became obsessed with and I wanted to be a state champ
 And so I I would practice I go to matches and I'm winning at my hand raise and then like I better
 I became a region champ
 I got my hand raise and I became a state champ and my hand raise and I became an all-American
 I had all these goals I was shooting towards right I think I'm college I have next thing
 But I always had something I was like aggressively running towards all my time energy effort thoughts were moving towards that thing and
 My senior year I was trying to be an all-American and at the Pac-10 tournament
 You have to quality to be the top like whatever one one or two spots of Pac-10 to qualify for that for the nationals
 And I was seated. I should have like it's ridiculous. I didn't but
 Lumbi hole I choked and I lost and so my career ended like three weeks before I thought it was going to and it was like the worst feeling in the world
 like
 Losing and then I was like that that's it
 I'll never wrestle again and it's like my whole life
 You know 15 years my life up to that point was that and then it was gone
 It was like taken from me before I was ready and I would have like gone into like severe depression
 I did a little bit
 But I had this little business thing that I was doing at a time
 And so like to get my mind off of like the pain and I just jumped into business and became obsessed and
 Like that's all I did for the next eight years in my life
 Like I didn't like I gained like 50-60 pounds like I was unhealthy. I was not happy
 I was just I had this thing and I was like I had new goal right I want to make money online
 And I was chasing in like my first I had this goal like I want to make whatever if I make six figures here
 That'd be insane
 So I was like I was running towards it running towards and so they hit it like my hand got raised
 I was like cool now
 I make I wanna make seven figures in a year and I was running running running running that made seven figures here
 And I was like hey, I wanna make eight figures in a year and that one took me a lot longer
 We've had it for three or four years almost got there and that's when the whole company crashed and then built it back up
 And then still we were I think we matched up about three three and a half million during that time and then
 Click once came it was like oh my gosh
 This is the thing right and I could like see the opportunity and then I started running and as we all did and started running and
 The goal was to build a 10 you know 10 million dollar your business and then we boom we hit and it was like cool
 Like let's do 50 million and boom we did that and then this year's like let's hit a hundred million
 We're gonna hit that this year and then for me
 It's like what's the next goal and I'm like, oh, what is next goal like
 going from
 hundred million to 200 million like isn't that exciting it's like I
 Was like winning another region champ like that where's the next state championship?
 Where's the next national like what's next thing and site for me?
 It's like the next thing is the billion which is like oh so far away
 I get honestly the reason why I didn't keep wrestling is the next level after like
 Where I dropped off of the Olympics and I knew that I'd get the Olympics
 It's like an 8 to 12 year like thing has like I don't have 8 to 12 years left in me
 So I that's why I stopped wrestling at that point and for me
 It's like that's where I announce like a billion dollars so far away
 It's like well do we sell and I guess that could be the hand raise
 But then then we go into severe depression because I got nothing else after you know like this is my thing and and anyway
 So that's kind of my question for them. It's like I don't know what to chase
 I'm not gonna get my hand raise
 I don't know what the next thing is and because that I feel like I'm spitting in circles like being really really busy because
 Because I feel like I need to be busy
 That that numbs the pain or not knowing what the next challenge is gonna be right
 That's kind of where I'm finding myself out
 And so I kind of sure that those guys and spend the next hour getting getting personal developed their person developing me
 It's fun
 And there are a lot of good things that came out of but the one like the one voice I heard that was like speaking directly to me was
 Was basically like
 I've always been like a player like I'm an all-star like and
 And I've had a good coach like I'm gonna cut count the outcome like I have been a good coach to our clients
 right like I'm like a coach friend in a Caitlin Alex Leyland all these people like I'm good at coaching people that are our
 students but I'm like the worst coach ever for our internal team like I just we're building out
 In fact I was thinking about it like I still like I'm
 I'm the guy who like I'm like the a-level player
 Like an all-star right and I'm playing on this team and everyone seems good
 But I had this weird thing where it's like like for example
 I copied it's good and instead of me coaching her how to make you create. I'm like
 I like grab it like I steal the ball from her
 I'm like I'm just gonna fix it I fix and I go and I dump the ball right like oh look how good I am
 I get my significance hit writer do a funnel is good or something
 But I'm like I like fix this not jumping on it's changed stuff
 No, because like I want to be the all-star and it's I mean it's good because we're putting out amazing stuff
 It's also bad because it's like I keep trying to be this all-star
 And it's not helping the team it's hurting the team more than anything and insurance discouraging to them and a whole bunch of other things that
 I probably wasn't even aware of how I started kind of really thinking through this and I think
 For me the next evolution if we're into a billion dollars
 It's not gonna be by me being an all-star and you know like you look at basketball teams teams have like one all-star
 They have an all-star who like gets all the the screen time but like the
 The teams that were the championships right the championship teams ones have like an amazing team
 And I realized that I could we're getting two billion dollars
 I can't from the marketing side. I can't do what I'm doing number one because I can't handle more number two
 It's just it's not how we're gonna scale like the way that we're gonna grow to the next levels
 I have to retire from being an all-star player and become an actual coach
 Like two or three weeks ago
 I did like first training to our team like on book story offer and like train them and everyone got excited
 It's a really cool thing and it's like me coaching them one of the guys in the group his name
 He's one the world of sales video for
 You've ever seen it's the greatest of video in history of
 The universe he wrote a sales video put it out there without having a list at all and day one to like
 $350,000 and sales day two is over half million and blew up and it's basically the best offer in the history of mankind until the FTC
 Shut them down. They got in trouble for it
 But he's like probably the best living copywriter right now
 He was doing his one-off things like that make a bunch of money, but it wasn't like a company and
 He was brother partnered up and his two brothers and they built out a whole company and
 They have like 150 plus employees
 They got 17 full-time writers now and this show though they'll do half a billion dollars in sales
 So that's how did you do it?
 He's like well, I that the way it did it
 He's like I couldn't keep writing you know to get this level
 I can't write all the copies like so I built this team of writers and this is what I do like my job is
 I come in every single day and I give a copy or any course to my guys
 It's gonna log in and I train them through copy and they get better and he's like that's that's how we're able to scale up
 girl so things because I got 17 writers and I'm training every single day and
 He's like I've become a coach and he's like they probably don't write as good to me
 But they're right good enough like really really good level and he's like getting better and better and he's just like
 It's like that's where you're able to scale it's like me as an all-star like we could have gotten to you know hundred million dollars
 but we could have got 500 million they there's no way and
 and
 Anyway, it was really
 Interesting another you talked about like when he does copyright and training it reminded me of like how do you do pair programming?
 where it's not like
 Someone code something you've logged in here. I got all you change stuff you like you basically
 He like you brings that the copywriter and shows on the big screen and like in the shows things like you know
 You're a great copywriter, but I'm gonna be super anal here to get this perfect and
 We're gonna go through slime a line and you like tell the person like hey
 You need to change that period to like three periods
 You need to change that to capital here because and like literally does like whole thing
 But makes a person do while he walks him through it and that was a person seeing why and understand the reasons behind it, right?
 and
 anyway, so
 Yeah, so for me
 I just I think that like that's that's the next steps
 life start transitioning away from being an all-star and hogging ball and like and not develop my team to actually
 focusing on becoming a really good coach for for our team so that's kind of my big realization and
 And a couple of two of things kind of add to it
 Like if you read the book good to create talk about you from a level of leadership and like level four versus level five
 And level five leaders
 So we're like builds and then when they when they leave the company continues to grow and excel level four leaders
 Someone who leaves and secretly hopes and collapses prove how good they are at what they do
 I was like, I think right on the level four leader, which is horrible
 And I don't want to be that one to be level five
 So I want to transition myself that way and the last cool thing I want to share and that'll be done my dad
 And I just think I just think with all of our project management so far
 They started project management stuff and something happens instead of just like coaching through that rip it away from him
 And you know, so I've gone through four or five people trying to do this. It's like
 I'm just a disruptive force. Anyway, I wanted because I still learning
 By the way, my dad when he turned 60 a little while ago, we did a big family meeting thing his first birthday and my mom
 Went through like each decade's life like zero to ten will tell us about that life in 10 to 20
 You know, so when he was an athlete wrestling the 20 to 30 when he became
 You know, like started his career stuff of that and 30 40 was like a dad
 He was coaching us as as wrestlers
 He's like a coach and then 50 to 60 the next phase 60, you know, and kind of walked through all the phase the decades and
 My dad was a great athlete and anyways kind of funks asked him afterwards
 I was like all the decades was your favorite. He was like my farm. My favorite was
 Was the decade where I was coaching you guys and he said that was my favorite best years in my life for that 10-year thing
 And I feel like I need to get point where I'm retiring for me and all starting like coaching our team
 And I think I think that's my next challenge
 I think that I'm gonna love it. I think it's so our team needs our companies like we're gonna get there and so
 Anyway, I'm sure you guys think it like oh, of course
 that makes 12 cents, but for me it was like a big aha and and giving me permission to
 To shift my focus a little bit
 any effort to
 To help develop everybody and get our team the best team in the world. So anyway, so I'll share that appreciate you guys
