 What's up everybody it's Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast today
 I'm gonna remind you of a lesson that I learned long ago that I just got re
 Introduced to that one and reintroduce you to as well
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, so
 Seriously, you know me with something is working really good and you stop doing it for some reason
 That's what happened to me. So let me tell you a story when we launched ClickFunnels
 We tried multiple different types of funnels right to get this thing to take off
 So number one we tried just selling a free trial to continuity
 We launched that and it bombed because we couldn't number one afford to pay for ads on
 Anything because we didn't make money for 14 days. So it's hard to grow it number two affiliates
 They want to grow because they weren't getting any money. So right thing it. All right, so let me shift it around right
 All right, we're gonna so click funnels for a thousand bucks for the year count and that'll be our model
 We did that and the webinar worked and converted the problem was we made a thousand bucks and then we didn't get any money again for another year
 Which makes it hard to hire developers and programmers and support people and all these people for the things where I go
 We want continuity income. So then this was the idea. This was the idea that took ClickFunnels
 From like a couple million dollar your business to a couple million dollar month business
 What we did is we had a basically you would register for the webinar and then on the thank you page
 You would go and get a free trial to click on this and go get free trial
 the free show up that we can play with it and then we're gonna show you how to use when you go on the webinar and
 That was the magic sauce year number one. We sold I think 2,500 people bought the thousand dollar offer
 But 7,500 stuck on the year
 So any of you are only 10,000 active members said you have hundred stuck from the trial
 And then we had continuity to pay for bills
 We had cash to pay for ads and pay for affiliates and things like that
 And that was the secret and we did that for years and then I
 forgot
 So there you go. So what happens the best of us?
 I forgot about that and for the most part
 I didn't do much things on an incubator automated webinar someone opted now and you go directly to the webinar and you got sold
 But you can get the thank you page all those kind of things. So rewind back to
 Three weeks ago
 We were doing the very first ever secrets masterclass and the secrets masterclass whole point
 It was like hey
 There's I'm gonna teach you a secret from dot-com secrets experts secrets and traffic seekers book and in the end of it
 Make you an off-of-click funnels and so we did that and in the like almost like a last minute thing
 I was like hey, how about this on registration process?
 Let's ask him the question like where are you struggling most in your business and the question is simple like number one
 Number one, I'm struggling on the funnel number two
 It's my funnels are converting number three I need more traffic and then basically when they picked it took them to three different
 Thank you pages. So they said I need more traffic. Thank you page like thanks so much for registering
 Hey, you told me that you're struggling with traffic. You should get free copy the traffic secrets book like it's awesome
 Go get it, you know and if they said I'm struggling with conversion. I was like, hey, thank you so much for registering
 By the way, you told me you're struggling with conversion you should get that the expert secrets book
 I'm like I'm struggling with funnels. I'm like doc on secrets book
 right so three different thank you pages and
 I said go get this book before the webinar starts that way, you know
 When the webinar ends you'll get the book in the mail and then you'll be able to start studying it
 And that was the offer in the very first week of the launch
 Before the webinar hit we did $50,000 in books, you know people going through the book funnels before the webinar started
 $50,000 which is crazy because I spent $50,000 in ads to fill that a webinar and I still would have been break even
 Okay, he is getting this so I was pretty excited the number two
 we had kind of the exact same thing is I
 Did the second week and the same thing we had similar results
 I'm we never made leads coming through so small but same kind of thing and then this week
 Or last week we did funnel Fridays for the first time and I might told you about that a little bit
 We did funnel Fridays and we the same kind of thing when they registered I asked them that we also have Jim's book Jim wrote a book called copywriting secrets
 I said is it funnels copy?
 Conversion or or traffic and based on others for different thank you pages same thing
 It crushed it we did I don't know 30 40 grand in sales before the webinar started
 Before the thing we start which is crazy and then this week we're doing this the list building secrets trading course
 And we hadn't registered but this time instead of having little books. I was like I think we have
 We have a seven dollar report called lead funnels calm
 Which is like has like 108 different swipe files different lead funnels
 I like and there's obviously a whole funnel behind it
 So this one I hadn't registered for list believe secrets in the thank you pages like by the way after you know
 Thanks so much registering you should go get this report before the thing starts
 Go get it right now so people go and they would get it as a seven dollar report. So
 We sent two emails out for this for this thing we had over ten dollars people register over
 $1000 in sales from lead funnels calm on this free thing
 That means we made $4 for every opt-in before the training even started
 Anyway, you guys getting this I want you to understand because like this
 Like using your thank you pages efficiently and effectively can literally replace
 Your ad costs like it makes your ads free I can spend $4 per lead to get some in register for this for this for this summit now for this
 This training series and still be profitable upfront before the thing even starts which is crazy
 Right, I think that's what I had forgotten about it is so exciting for me
 I'm more excited refreshing than thank you page stats and I am with
 You know with doing the actual webinar doing the cells like I'm more excited about that part of it because it's just free money before we even
 Start the selling process, which is which is really really cool
 So I want you to think about that and go back like what are your friend offers?
 You have like we can put in thank you pages for webinar registration pages for your opt-ins for your everything like like the thank you page offer
 Maybe like the new secret that we're remembering once again
 And so I want to put that into your your minds is like an interesting thing to think about and to start and start playing with so
 Anyway, I'm gonna keep doing it. I'm gonna test a bunch of offers different things
 But I'm just pumped and excited about so I want to share it yesterday as we're going in to today
 So I'm going back into day number two now of the list building seekers training
 To keep fulfilling and tonight I make the soft offer and tomorrow we make the harder offer and even if we fail
 We already made 40 grand up front before we even started
 Which is amazing. So my goal is to 10x that if I can make 400 grand that make me happy
 But I don't know who knows we'll see what happens anyway. I appreciate you guys
