 Hey, what's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the
 Marketing Secrets Podcast. Today I want to talk about finding your weaknesses
 and fortifying against them so you can be protected in all aspects of your
 business and your life. So the big question is this. How are entrepreneurs
 like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from
 our own pockets? How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our
 services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain
 profitable? That is the question and this podcast will give you the answers. My
 name is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing Secrets.
 What's up everybody? Hope you guys are doing awesome today. We are less than two
 weeks away from following in life as I'm recording this. In fact I've been on
 slidesmacked down, building up millions of slides, working in presentation, working
 in video like there's so much that goes into this. It is crazy but we're having a
 time and I think we'll make it to the finish line in time as long as nothing
 bad happens. So there you go. Those of you who are listening to some real time
 you know that right now we're you know still in the middle of this whole COVID
 pandemic thing and there's chaos and there's anyway there's a lot of things
 and so but as they say in show business the show must go on right and so we are
 doing for a lot in life. We've got I think about 3,000 people coming live to the
 event. We got another 2-3,000 people streaming live from home and so yeah
 the party must go on so we're excited but at the same time there's a lot of
 nervousness that comes around to right for all the obvious reasons and so I
 want to talk about just a principle that I've been thinking about and trying to
 practice specifically around this event with my health but it ties into so many
 aspects of your life and there's actually so there's a story in the
 scriptures where they talk about this this award that's happening right and
 there's this there's the not the village but the city that's trying to protect
 them so if I didn't they're in the city and you look around the city there's like
 these hills and these mountains and there's you know mountains are kind of
 protecting them. There's a couple spots in the mountain where there's like there
 there's it's easier for people to get through right so these weak spots where
 it's easier for you know an invading army to attack because it's like these are
 the spots they would attack and so the guy who's the general of this army is
 looking at that same game these are the weaknesses like if someone's gonna
 attack us they're not gonna come over the mountain they're gonna come through
 this path or this path and these are the spots that were weak therefore we
 know these are our weaknesses we need to fortify against that so they brought
 troops and armies and things around the weak spots to protect themselves and
 that way when the enemy came they will protect themselves and protect their land
 right so there's the kind of the there's the story the scriptural story with
 the principle right is finding your weak spots and fortifying against them and so
 so for me right now in this season is again I'm about to go to finalizing
 lives and be kind of people and and you know if if I get sick for whatever
 reason like it could be really really bad because you know you could do the math
 how many tickets times how much money per ticket times you know all the
 thing it's if you really financially bad for the company it'd be bad because
 people have flights hotels I could just be bad all around so I need to make sure
 I'm there and so the first thing I'm asking is like what it like what are the
 what are the potential things that would keep this from happening right what
 potential weaknesses they could take me out of play right and so the thing about
 that one is like well if I fly if I fly there publicly I'm in a plane with
 two thousand people like what if when I'm sick whatever like you know like
 that's that's a scary thing so I was like okay I need to figure out a different
 way to get there so we decided if I private right so there's one way we
 protect ourselves number two it's like I need to make sure my immune system is
 good right I have not had COVID yet and so it's like I haven't had it but I got
 to make sure my immune system is protected so what does that mean well
 okay what are the supplements I need to what are the vitamins what are the
 things we've had doctors coming over to give me IV drips you know all sorts of
 stuff to like strengthen my immunity so that I can handle it right I've been
 trying which is hard for me I'm trying to get more sleep and trying to like not
 stress I'm trying to relax like all the things that typically weaken some of the
 immune system right so find those things I'm trying to fortify against them now
 that doesn't mean you know just like the story with the army doesn't mean the
 army's not gonna get through and attack them like they might right and maybe the
 army breaks doing and even though you fortify it gets through right like I can
 still get sick I could still have different issues like the million things
 that could happen but I know where the weaknesses are therefore I should
 fortify against it right and try to protect myself and so that's kind of the
 message and so I want to show you guys because that's true in a lot of areas
 of life like for example I'm not obviously the health guy and but I would
 I would recommend for everyone knowing you know again the situation the world's
 in right now is like looking at your own health like like where my potential
 weaknesses do I need to lose weight do I need to get strength I need to get more
 vitamins like what are the things you need to personally do to like protect
 yourself right like I'd be looking at those things and how do you fortify
 against it if you could be different than me right everyone's got different ways
 and I'm not going to go it's too politically charged again to it but like
 you know if you believe that that that the vaccine or whatever is the way to do
 it then go that way if you believe that healthy like what I don't care what is
 like pick your pick what's what you personally believe then fortify yourself
 against it right look at the stats like let's study figure out what those things
 are and then protect yourself right so there I'll leave that there because I
 again it's ridiculous how charged this whole topic is but it is so I'm not
 gonna say one way that what I believe or what I think you guys should believe
 because I don't care when I'll send out I think everyone should should make
 decisions for themselves and figure out what's what's best for them in their
 family but then go through it and like go intense on it they don't anyway so
 then I want to transition to business because you guys come here to learn
 business for me not to learn health so let's talk about business so I want you
 think about in your business like what are the the same things like everyone's
 got the same same thing right there's there's weaknesses that you got to
 fortify against like I was thinking back the very first time that I was going my
 my business very first collapse that I had was because I had no I only had one
 traffic source and so when that traffic source disappeared my business
 disappeared as well right and so like and I went through the crash right then
 because I hadn't fortified if I had been smart I was okay but my business
 where's the choke point like what's the thing that I'm weak at okay it is I only
 one traffic source therefore I need to I need to go there and fix that and
 strengthen it and like put those things around it to protect it right so that's
 the first time second time my business crashed because I only had one merchant
 provider when that one merchant provider decided like my business everything got
 shut down right and it was my choke point I hadn't fortified against so as we
 started building click funnels we were very strategic like hey what are all the
 things that could happen like what are the things that you know they could make
 our business fall down and we had to be very like talk about like very openly
 because a lot of times we don't want to think about these kind of things right
 because they don't sound good but you know one was like what if Russell gets
 hit by a bus what if Todd gets hit by a bus right what happens if our merchant
 account shuts down what happens if our otter responders what happens if our
 traffic dries up what if Facebook's ads stop working what if what I'm start
 thinking through all these different weaknesses right just like the army
 generals looking at like here in the mountains where people are gonna attack
 us right or me going to the vent like like these things that would happen to
 make them it not happen right if I got sick or if these different things like
 so you're identifying you're being very real right and you're having
 conversations that aren't fun to have like Russell gets hit by a bus that's not
 a fun conversation to have like what do we do right but looking at those things
 identifying them and then say okay how do we fortify against these weaknesses
 okay what are the things like what are the what are the things I need to do to
 make sure I'm protecting myself right do I have a second merchant account of
 case I need it do I have you know this do I have this like looking at all
 different pieces and having backup plans and having things in place because it's
 crazy how fast things happen in this in this industry in this business I've seen
 so many people who have really good businesses who've lost them quickly
 because they didn't fortify because they ran their whole business on Facebook ads
 and Facebook shut down they ran their whole business on SEO and they got
 slapped right and so it's finding like what are the choke holds in your business
 and they're gonna be different for everyone right so it might be you have a
 key employee who just runs everything that person disappeared what would you
 do right or partner or you right and so it's something that I don't know the
 answer to but I want to raise the question because I would be doing you guys
 just service if I didn't bring that so it's not running through your head like
 man because I didn't think about my traffic sources in the first time I got
 slapped I didn't think about my merchant account the second time I got slapped
 right I was looking at all the positive because we're entrepreneurs we're looking
 at the positive looking at the vision looking at the future we're looking at
 things that we think are gonna be so great right and we're not looking at like
 oh what if this happens what if this happens like we're we're optimists right
 and so everything's always gonna work out but the reality is sometimes it
 doesn't and if we're prepared for it we fortified against it we've got backup
 plans we can move we can shift we can make those adjustments but if you don't
 that's when you get in trouble and so I want to protect you guys so that was
 the point of this podcast episode is to protect yourself the podcast cover image
 I'm using this time is me sitting at my desk with a whole bunch of IVs plugged
 into me because I spent seven hours yesterday with IVs of every known
 substance known to man going into my blood system to protect me and increase
 my immune system and to help me have the energy and all the different things
 right and so it's it's those kind of things that we're doing and yeah it's
 funny I actually was Instagraming yesterday as I was doing it and I got tons
 of messages people like you okay you dog are you sick what's happening I'm like
 no like this is a preventative right and it's funny because most of us this
 comes back to us as humans being pessimist or optimistic right we're
 optimists my dad sells insurance or he did before he retired he sold insurance
 and and the insurance that they would get the biggest like bonuses and rewards
 for selling life insurance and I talked to my dad about this because life insurance
 you don't have to have right but it's the one that's like the most important
 they said it was the hardest to sell because no one wants to think like think
 about that I'm gonna live forever I'm gonna be fine and they they push that
 out so it's very very difficult to sell life insurance yet it's the thing that's
 probably the most important of all of them right it's easy to sell calling
 insurance easy to sell house insurance things like that but the one that's like
 the most critical you know it's hard to sell because people are all
 optimistic like oh I'm gonna live forever I'm gonna be healthy oh you know
 whatever it is and they don't think about it and then it hits and it's too
 late so same things true for us as entrepreneurs we have to be thinking
 about those things and putting in perspective so that said prepare yourself
 prepare your health prepare your business prepare your life prepare your
 family like look at the look at the things that could go wrong and start
 building the strength holds around them hope this helps appreciate you guys
