 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast
 Today I'm in my car heading downtown to the penthouse to record videos with Jay Shady's company
 And we're just some cool stuff and I'll tell you one more about that when we come back from the intro
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody hope you guys are awesome, like I said I'm heading downtown boy is he right now and we hired
 Jay Shady's company
 To make some really cool videos for us and if you haven't seen Jay Shady
 Obviously they you know he's got a huge following tons of viral videos and what's cool is the way they do their videos
 It's very interesting a different way that I've ever done it before they figure out like a story from your life
 And that's like a moral like here's the moral story and they script out the story and then they film you talking to camera, right?
 Which we don't a ton of things like that
 But then what they do is they hire actors to act out
 The actual story and then they weave it together between your voice over you talk in the camera and then actors acting out
 Part of your life and so anyway, I'm doing it, but then we hired to do I think eight videos for us
 And so yesterday I was downtown filming the first I think we filmed five of the stories yesterday or six
 So I have three or four more today, and then they're gonna go back
 To LA where they're from and they hire actors to act out my life. How crazy is that?
 I'm like so excited and so nervous to see my life acted out. Oh, man
 But it'll be fun kind of fun to see what happens these videos and and how it all goes so
 Any that's what I'm doing today and
 As I'm driving downtown
 I started coming out with you guys today. I miss podcasting spent a little bit since I've sat down and I
 Wanted to share with you guys. There's something that I thought was kind of interesting today
 So as a lot of you guys know we launched the new updated to comic club ex coaching program
 a couple man about a month and a half ago
 during the two comic club live event and we got about
 250 new people that came in the program
 Which is awesome?
 So we're taking them all through and the existing members and everyone else in this new process, and it's it's really fun and day number one
 Or week number one and I gave them all an assignment
 Which was to retire your old email address like you're getting too much crap too much distraction
 This is why most of you're not having having success is because you can't even
 Control your email box was like everyone. I want you to retire your email box
 I had everyone retired I showed him how to do and the whole process
 You don't miss out on any important emails
 But that's when you're staying for new email address
 I want you to do it in a very strategic way
 And so what I showed him how to do is how to create labels and folders for every single newsletter
 And I was like every ad you see you need to go opt into the ad every ad like like no longer you like I'm annoyed
 By all the ads on Facebook you realize the only purpose of Facebook is for you to click on ads
 Like that's it and so my go follow everything you're interested in in your market and then every ad you see every
 Not like everyone's on every ad you see you click on it
 You go to it and then you opt it like you have to and then I said when they when you when you put your email address in
 Then I start sending emails and then as soon as the first email comes in you step a filter and say okay every email like this
 Skip the inbox and go directly into this folder and then what happens is you start building up all these folders?
 With with all the newsletters in the industry and so this becomes your swipe file
 And what a lot of people know is that like people always ask them rest of how your emails so good
 How do you get such high conversion rates and blah blah blah?
 It's because every email I send out I have like a dozen or so my favorite emailers throughout time and I open up my folders with all
 Their emails in it and I go through and I just look at all their subject lines
 That's literally how I figured out and they like everyone's I thought of the best open lines like I don't recreate
 I scroll back through ten years of emails and like oh that one caught my attention all that one caught my attention and I use those and
 That's been my big secret who is I just I funnel high people what what Russell you practice what you preach?
 Yes, I do anyway, so as I was going to exercise
 I was like realizing that I haven't retired my email address in a while
 I try to retire every I don't know a year to two years or so because it just gets so overwhelming that I can't handle it
 so I set up an email address like two or three days ago to do it
 I've been telling them what to do and I started over I started building my folders and stuff and
 I started re-opting in everyone's list and getting you know
 Getting all the forwarding in place and it's been fun watching and every day you log in it's like oh
 You know I got three more emails today. I got five emails
 It's just like it's fun to watch in real time as your as your email swipe file is getting built up and
 But what's interesting is I started being frustrated because like I have a decade worth of emails that
 But I couldn't you know that I couldn't
 See any more because I'm just getting the new ones and my thing
 I was like oh so I was trying to go to my old email like forward all the emails from the past and I couldn't figure
 How to do it and there's no easy way to do it. That's kind of frustrated eventually after like 15 minutes of trying
 I found some software
 I remember I was calling some Google plug-in that allowed for email someone to unbox another and I started freaking out
 Because I think it was like a hundred fifty dollars to the software so bought it and I tried I did a test
 I like one I said okay. I want to free my old email address, which I have an email address that I've had for like
 Like 15 years. I said okay
 I want to forward every single email from Frank Hearne into my new inbox and then filtered all you know
 Skip my inbox but put it all into this new Frank Hearne folder
 So I set it up clicked a button and took like an hour
 So and it forwarded every email the Frank Hearne has ever set in the last
 15 years into my in this folder and I was like oh my gosh, they're all there and I put them somebody else and so
 I should look in all my favorite emailers. I did that to our all there or their list and suddenly
 My new inbox is just or my new email address these folders are full
 I was looking this morning like one of them's got
 2,500 emails into it one's got like 1,700 emails was about 1,500 like it's just kind of fun
 So I have this huge swipe file building being built up my new email address that way I'm checking my email
 I have access to all the greatest newsletters and the other thing was fun as I started doing this
 I started realizing like I've had tons of old email addresses throughout time and so I
 Started logging into all my old email accounts
 and started setting up these forwarders and
 Such a nerd I'm gonna have the greatest email spot file of all time but
 emails from you know last almost 20 years now we're all being forwarded into this one box from all my old email addresses
 And it's just it's really cool. So I'm telling you this for a couple reasons number one
 You guys should all do this even if you don't want to retire your email address. You should start setting up
 The the folders in your Gmail and I started setting up filters for every email comes in and filter into these different newsletters
 That way you say who here's every email or else is ever said here's every email that someone's ever said
 You can start seeing those and it gives you ideas for swipe files headline subject ideas like just tons of stuff
 So that's number one number two. This is a big a hi-hat. I started try like I was moving all these people over and
 It's funny because like there's people that are like who who I've known who they are the longest like for a decade or more right the most prolific people and
 And as I was looking at it like some of these email boxes
 I had like you know 1500 2,000 emails in there and first I was like oh it's awesome
 I was like it's gonna be more is gonna be more and I started thinking
 1500 emails they said one email a day
 365 days that take that would take almost an email a day for like a decade to get 2,000 emails
 And I was like oh my gosh like the people who I still know today people who are still relevant today people who still have the companies today
 We're sending on average. I would say
 3 to 7 emails a week
 And I still think these other people who I knew were good emailers back in the day
 But I can haven't heard from them. They're no longer relevant
 I don't know what's happened to them as looking at them as I import them over
 I might have a hundred assages over the last decade and I'm like oh they were sending like
 maybe an email a week or maybe one or two a month and
 It's interesting because they're no longer relevant. They're no longer around most of them even some of these ones who are amazing emailers
 and so my big like
 Epiphany again was like I know there's always this conversation like how much emails too much like you said one a day
 You said one a week one a month you sell them to a day and there's all these different things
 And I think that the reality is the people who are the most
 Who we all know the people who have been around for the longest they send a lot of emails
 I'd say on average about one a day or more and so I'm telling you that because
 I want to give you guys permission if you want to be relevant if you want to be around a long time
 You probably need to send more emails to your list
 I'd say a minimum of one a day
 That no it sounds like oh people are gonna freak out so what do you know they like that's okay if they freak out
 They're gonna leave that's not a bad thing
 But if they're if you're not top-mind not top-of-the-in box about there you're getting drowned out by all the other noise
 I have one friend who he's email nine times a day
 Ridiculous, but he's in there how to pick up chicks market
 He's like look all I know is that someday their hearts gonna be broken
 I gotta make sure the second the hearts broken on the first email in their inbox
 So it's like so I send out a lot and when they're when they're dating and they're gonna get a relationship
 They might read my stuff cuz it's entertaining. They're not gonna buy my stuff
 But the second their heart's broken. I need to be the first email. So that's why you send out so many emails, you know
 it's just
 Anyway interesting mindset. I don't agree with the nine emails a day
 I have two friends who specifically folks on two emails a day and they swear by it
 It's like it's it's how they built their companies and and you know they wouldn't do any other way and so anyway
 Just just kind of think through about like I said doing this little exercise and pulling all these emails in
 I'm realizing the people that are most prolific people have been around for decades or longer are all sending out a lot of emails
 It's just why the email subject lines are so good
 They they tested every day they have a chance to come up to bat and try again and try again
 And try against because that the emails are getting better and better and better and better
 And so I think it's a skill set that all of us need to refocus on and get better at so there you go
 a couple big takeaways from today the email swipe file send more emails and
 There's probably some else cool in there. I can't remember anyway
 I hope I hope that helps appreciate you guys all
