 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody so I want to talk today about
 Internal project we have called project mother funnel and I'm really excited about it
 And I think I've told you guys a little couple little secrets about it
 But today Brandon Poland
 From a lady boss weight loss asked me like what is what is a mother funnel tell me about it?
 I want to know it's I started telling him that I was geeking out and I'm like alright
 I'm a new podcast on this day because there's some cool strategy behind it and what we're doing now
 I want to preface the strategy may not be perfect for all of you guys
 Or at least not of you yet, but long term. It's something that is really really cool. So
 we
 As you know launch click funnels and
 For me, that's where my story before took us five funnels before excuse me six six funnels when the finally took off
 and
 And then when took off it was awesome and it's grown and it's been nuts. It's been literally Christmas every day since
 Well, not I'm not gonna lie. There's a couple of Halloween's in there, but for most part Christmas every single day
 But it's been awesome and
 Was actually those when we first launched click phones like our goal was like conversion conversion
 How do we get as many people in as possible and that was always the the thing was wrong?
 We had the free trial we have like high converting landing pages and like you know all that kind of stuff
 And it's been really good not talking down against any of that
 But it's interesting as we've grown I remember when we first launched and click funnels Todd told us
 He's like based on how many people were adding each day
 So as soon as we get to the point where out 60,000 subscribers
 He's like we won't be able to grow anymore because based on our churn numbers like I don't know the churn numbers
 But I let's say 10% of people churn each month
 at 60,000 members
 That's 6,000 people a month that are churning and so if you had any 6,000 people want to be churning like whatever
 Anyway, whatever the numbers were about 60,000 members
 That's when we stopped growing we're just it flat lines and I did that in making logical sense to me
 Until we got to 55,000 customers and then it started getting slower and 56 took way longer 57 took a little longer
 And we've been sitting out with 57 for the last couple weeks and I will get close 58
 But it's just like everything slowing down to screeching halt and I'm like ah
 Todd no two doms Todd was right once again
 I see no everything all the time drives me crazy
 Don't tell him I told you that but he seems always be right and he was right again and so on our side
 I'm like, okay, what do we got to do?
 So obviously we're doing a lot of things we're fixing cleaning up onboarding cleaning up
 User experience UI some cool UI still coming out you guys the next couple months, which is so exciting
 But on my side cuz I don't have any skills to do anything other than like the sales funnel
 So I'm like, okay, how do we do the sales funnel and change it out?
 So the interesting is we had this thought of like the problem is like we're go
 We're have conversion so high that everybody can come in and sign up which is good as we're growing
 But now we're so we're like actually hurts us because of some people coming in and all that kind of stuff
 So like how do we flip this around?
 By the same time we just in testing we fit we were looking at all our different front end offers different books and things like that
 I did a podcast on this I believe
 But there's a huge a huge difference in what product some big purchase immediately before they join click funnels
 And and then they're they're stick rate their churn rate there's just direct correlation
 So if they buy this product first they're gonna there gonna be what they're gonna say way longer versus this product
 It'd be less so I was like holy cow this whole pre-framing pre-swaging thing that we keep talking about
 It's actually true like it's it's a legitimate thing
 The pre-frame somebody enters your world and will have a hundred percent to do with how long they stick what they do
 How they buy how they send everything like geez we need to focus more on on
 architecting the pre-frame right and so that's what project mother funnel came about and it's something that
 This is not new is called project super funnel last year
 And we just didn't have the team the people in place to do it and after sure bill its agency finally got point
 We're like we have the team now
 We've got the copy editors designers the programmers like the developers like all the people we need to actually make project mother funnel
 Become live back to one of them. I can't remember who was was the one that coined it. I think it's like a mother funnel
 I'm like that's the new name. So it's literally called project mother funnel on our trailer board anyway, so um
 This is kind of the
 The gist of how it works the goal is or two thing number one is to actually decrease
 conversions to weed out the people that are most likely gonna churn anyway and then to
 After we weed out those people then to
 Significantly affect the pre-frame that somebody goes through before they sign up for the trial
 There's the concept right so how we doing that so when somebody comes you'll see this live in probably next 60 30 60 days
 60 the live events in like 28 days
 So yeah, it'll be hopefully if we get done to be soon in that maybe we'll go off live after the event anyway
 You come to Lanny page and on the Lanny page, they'll be video and then it basically
 Ask you like which one of these markets even we've kind of broken click phones down into 10 segments now
 And so some little self-select like oh, I'm an agency or oh, I'm in this I'm in this and though
 That's like like the type of business that they're in and after then we'll redirect them
 We'll get them to opt in it will take them to a sales page that's specifically written for that market
 Okay, this is the pre-frame we're trying to adjust and affect the pre-frame
 So they'll go through to see this pre-frame of this page that'll show them how click phones works for them number one cancellation reason
 We have outside of it's too expensive is
 Which by the way, it's not a valid excuse, so I don't believe it
 But number one valid excuse people have why the cancel is because they can't figure out how it actually works for their business or their industry or whatever
 And so this page will identify which one these 10 markets you and then it specifically sells you on that's like oh cool
 You're in retail. Let me show you how funnels work for retail and it sells them specifically where they are
 So it should be a frame that's gonna increase their their their stick rate because they come through this frame
 It helps them understand how click phones actually works for their business and then they sent for the trial
 So we lengthen the process decrease initial conversion pushed out a lot of
 those who would just churn out anyway and those who we who are gonna try now know who they are and we
 increase the likelihood to stick because of the pre-frame we took them through and
 And then after they they either sign up for the trial
 They don't then they get three emails afterwards each email has a case study of somebody in their industry
 I showing how it worked for them specifically and it pushes back to their specific sales letter
 So it's three of those in a row and then and the other testimonials of us
 But there's a whole sequence follow up sequence now specific to them and their market their situation as well
 And so that is kind of what project mother funnel is and it's exciting and I'm pumped for it
 So anyway, you guys will see the fruits of it here in a little bit
 But that's the concept behind it and I hope that me explain that helps some of the wheels has to spin again
 I don't necessarily say let's decrease conversions on our page and make it harder
 But sometimes there's a point of like segmenting the audience weeding out the people you don't want and then increasing
 the
 The pre-frame to make that person stick longer and I think it's amazing. So there you go. It could completely flop though for all I know
 Anyway, it's awesome. Hope you guys loved it if you
