 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to marketing seekers podcast. I'm so excited to have you guys here today
 That says this cute theme song and we're gonna get to some fun
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right everybody so I just dropped my kids off the school
 I'm driving back. There's always tons of traffic. So it's like, you know what? I want to hang out with you guys a little bit
 this morning I woke up early and
 Actually had wrestling practice not for my kids. I did a rest when I practice my kids last night
 Today I did it for myself because I'm actually going to go and compete in a tournament in like six weeks from now
 And I'm insanely out of shape
 But I'm also so excited like ah so excited. It's um
 It's uh, it's funny cuz like I haven't actually put on a wrestling singlin like I think 16 or 17
 You hear something like that so I'm super nervous, but like I was weird like I never thought I'd be done wrestling
 But like when I got done I was done like it was the weirdest thing like my whole life was folks on this thing and
 My senior year I was working towards going to the NCAA tournament. I wanted to be an all-american and
 at the Pac-10 tournament before NCAA's
 I thought for sure I was gonna I think it was like the top like first and second place
 they took the NCAA tournament or something like that and
 It was crazy is
 Like my I think my second match. I wrestled the returning Pac-10 champ
 and I beat him I beat him really good actually so I was like I was like I should win Pac-10 like I just
 destroyed the dude who won it last year and
 Then somehow I lost like some dude who I'd never heard of never seen him never anything
 and I and I lost to him and I didn't make any sense and I got knocked out tournament and I didn't get to go it was a weirdest thing where like
 You know when you think there's gonna be an ending like you can prepare like mentally prepare for that
 So I was like okay my senior year my last tournament's gonna end say tournament
 I'm really excited. I was like looking forward to this thing and then two weeks earlier the Pac-10 I lost and it was like
 it was done and
 it was over and I
 wasn't ready for it to be over but it was and it was it's crazy and
 Anyway, I think like I would have gone into like severe depression because like my whole life is focusing on this one thing
 And then you don't even get to go to the thing like a horrible feeling but luckily I had this little
 fledgling little business I'd started up and so I shifted all my focus to that to get away from the pain and for the next
 Yeah, 16 years my life. That's all it is is business thing and luckily it turned out to be a good
 Kind of waste of my energy in time
 It's been fun, but I know that like even like seven or eight years ago
 I like miss wrestling so much that I'm seeing as heard the story came to listen to podcasts like I built up a wrestling gym
 And I hired the Olympic Greco coach
 I flew him to Boise and then I hired like eight or nine guys who were training for Olympics and flew him to Boise
 And I paid their salaries because I wanted to wrestle again
 I wanted to compete and train so I started training and I got trained for probably six or so months getting ready for I got hurt
 once or twice so my body was weak and
 I was planning and going to like a tournament
 I was like so excited to go and actually put a singlet on again a wrestling tournament and then our business crashed and I
 Had to go back in the business try to save it
 I spent you know six seven eight months trying to save the business and then I ended up actually like let go all the
 wrestlers and the wrestling team so they ran out of money and I never got a Russell even though I spent half a million bucks and
 I don't see I never even got a goal on the mat and killed me and then like I was focusing on that
 I trying to rebuild the business and then
 In the next two or three years I know what I was doing and then like click funnels came down and like holy cow would a roller coaster
 Right, that's been the last five years. It's been so much fun
 but it's been crazy and right now it's like we've got a fun hacking live and
 There's a wrestling tournament the big US opens in Vegas in like six weeks. I was like, you know what?
 I'm just gonna go I I just I'm just gonna go and I'm just gonna wrestle and like and
 I'm probably gonna be horrible and I'm probably gonna get beat and that's okay
 I just want to like go and and just I want to I just want to wrestle I remember when I was in college
 I'd go to the open nationals US nationals and I remember there's different divisions
 So there's a division that's like 35 to 45 years old. That's division. I'll be in now and then after 45
 It's like 45 like 90, you know
 It's like the veterans division for old men and there's this dude who was like probably like 80 something years old
 He had like he was bald and had like gray hair around his ears, you know
 and he was out there in a single wrestling and I remember thinking like I hope that's me when I'm like 80 years old and
 You know what? I've been a was I've lost 18 you say 17 however my 16 17 years 18 years
 I don't know what it is. I haven't competed once and I did some Jiu Jitsu tournaments, which was fun
 But like wrestling is what I love and so I was like I'm just gonna go and I'm gonna make this a yearly thing
 Where I just go even if I'm out of shape if I'm gonna get beat out care
 I'm just gonna fly there wrestle do my thing and just just to like not lose that part of my identity. So
 Anyway, so I'm pumped and excited and I have a lifting weights for it. So I'm like I'm strong
 But like I haven't wrestled other than wrestling my kids
 So today my buddy Lex case came over when I own wrestling friends from Boise State and hopefully he's gonna come to
 Which would be fun because I'll at least a workout partner more mop whip
 Anyway, and we we we wrestled today and it was so much fun and I'm so out of shape, but
 Anyway, it was it was good. I really I really uh really enjoyed it. So that's uh
 That's uh kind of what what happened this morning dropped my kids off school now
 I'm now I'm going back to the pick up my stuff and head in the office
 So but as I was driving today as the kids and we were singing
 Greatest showman and head bang and having a bunch of fun
 Cuz I try to get them in state before they have to go to the most horrible thing on planet earth
 I don't tell them that yet, but it is right like school's the worst
 Oh, and so I know like I hated school every day
 So I'm like if I need to get in state every day before they go to school at least it'll help them a little bit. So totally
 Yeah, we listen music
 We head bang and we have to charge them as much fun as possible to give them in good state before they enter the the doors of
 Of like the worst place on earth such a bad example somebody list this podcast like dad you made this go to school
 Like I know it's the system. It's horrible, but you gotta go if you want to wrestle, which is important
 So anyway, I dropped them off school and as I was driving and we're having fun
 I was thinking about this this industry that we're in and a lot of you guys you're just starting this business or you've been in for a little while
 But it's interesting like I think what made me think about is I look down
 I got a text from stripe every morning. I get texts from stripe like ten of them for all their merchant accounts we have and
 You know right now we average
 Every three days or so is a million dollars in sales, right?
 So it's like whatever 300 whatever thousand dollars a day or whatever in stripe transactions ish
 So these are higher some news lower, but you know
 It to be a hundred million dollars in sales. That's a million bucks every three days, which is kind of where we're at
 And hopefully more next year it is can keep going up, but I saw the transactions come through
 I was like oh, it's like 300 whatever thousand dollars today came through
 And it's interesting because I remember like when we used to do the big so let me some telling just gonna rewind back in history like
 Like the internet marketing game back in the day was product launches, right?
 It's like you spend three months creating product right in sales that are getting people to promote getting all the buzz getting the bill
 Getting everything and if you did good job, you'd have a million dollar launch
 But then you have to go to Philly commissions half to prizes
 You know you end up with two hundred fifty thousand dollars if you did a good launch
 And if your launch failed then there was like hundred grand or less or fifty grand
 You know whatever whatever it was and it was like once a quarter
 We'd all plan a launch and so and was funny is like every week
 There's somebody doing the launch right you kind of knew that every quarter you'd have your shots
 You go create new product and create anything and during the during the off season when it wasn't your week
 You'd be promoting everybody else's launch in hopes that that you do well for them so that they would promote your launch when your
 Launch came back around it was crazy because like your list be you know right after your your launch your list be hot
 It would be amazing
 But as you got closer and closer to your launch you get worse and worse
 You probably like everybody else's launches throughout this whole cycle and then you know
 You'd hope that you build up enough for us to process you by the time your product came out
 You could launch it and make you know make you million bucks get a new hot list and start promoting other people's products
 And it was a horrible cycle
 It was so bad on your customers and bad on your list and bad on everything
 But it was how the game was played for so long and so interesting watching the last
 You know six or seven years as the product launch games kind of died. There's still people doing product launches, but
 It shifted from from the product launch model to the media buying model and it's a it's a shift that I am like so grateful for
 I love Mark Zuckerberg like I love that dude
 I
 Don't know if I believe his politics actually I have no idea what his politics are I'm assuming I don't though
 But I don't know if I you know all those things but I love him because he created this platform that gave all of us
 People the ability to buy ads on it, you know and Instagram's the same thing and YouTube and Google
 You know, Google's had its ups and downs, but right now Google's Google and YouTube are about 50% of our traffic down Facebook Instagram
 So 50% and then there's you know fill it well
 My percentages are off
 I'd say 15% affiliates and then the other half is split between Facebook Facebook Instagram on one side and YouTube and Google on the other side
 But man, I'm so grateful for these platforms that made it where it's like we can actually run sustainable businesses
 Not like the old product launch days
 Which is like I scratch your back you scratch my back all be like no next it was good markers
 They were just people who you know
 The people made the most money the people that had the best friends that was kind of it and it's it's been fun watching
 You know as as we've broken outside of that cycle we still do affiliate stuff
 But and we still feel it's promote our things, but it's not based on like
 You know it's based on who's got the best product. He's got the highest converting offer who who can buy the most media
 You know that that's the game nowadays is who can profitably buy media which now it's like it's it's like a pure game, right?
 It's not just like a
 Good old boys club
 It's it's who can actually buy media
 Profably and there's the skills that are buying media the skills they're building a funnel and skills of having good offer like it's it's
 Forged people to be better at the game, but it's made the game more pure and
 Anyway, I'm just telling you is this because
 You know a lot of you guys are just jumping in right now
 And you know you don't know what the history was and how the past was but it's really cool because the way that it works today
 It really is based on like who's the best like who's got the best
 You know who's the best of buying ads who's the best at creating good offers hooks and stories and offers and who's the best at creating funnels and like
 You know and if you're mediocre nowadays back in the day
 You can be mediocre as long as you had friends with the big email list who put all your stuff you'd win
 But nowadays it's like you actually have to be good and it's it's kind of cool
 It's like survival to fit us like the marketplace votes now on what's good and what's not good
 And if you're not good, you're not gonna win and so for us and for me and for you
 It gives us a shot like if we want to be if we want to win this game
 Like there are skill sets we have to learn there. We have to actually become good. It's not just it's not a good old boys club anymore
 It's not based on popularity contest
 It's 100% based on your skill set and what you're willing to do and what you're willing to learn and evolve into and grow into
 And so if you're not willing to do that, you're not gonna win
 Play playing out and back when I got started this game 10 years ago
 It did not matter how good your skills it was just mattered how good your your network was and the good old boys club
 And how you can you know, you can hang out with people and there's still some of that
 But for the most part, you know, Zuckerberg doesn't care who you are doesn't care
 Who you are all he cares is that you create ads that people like people click on them
 You know and if you do good stuff the ads get cheaper if you if you're bad like you get banned and things like that
 It's just like it's I don't know. It's made the game more pure and I love it
 You know, and it's it's been I think
 You know, I always struggled to penetrate the good old boys club and get into with all the you know
 The syndicates and the things like that that there were you know
 All these guys that were cool that they didn't think I was cool for some reason and I always hate that I was like man
 I feel like my skill sets better. I'm working hard. I'm learning more
 I'm doing things but I was never able to like be in the top 1% just because you know, I
 Wasn't a good network. I got nervous around people. I I was an introvert
 I struggled and now that stuff doesn't matter anymore all matters like who loves this game the most
 Who's obsessed with it?
 Who's gonna study and learn and grow and figure these things out and test and try and make the most offers and put them do
 Them more, you know, like whoever makes the most offers in this game is gonna win because you're gonna find out what offers work
 What offers don't work and some people spend nine months trying to create an offer and it's like why would you do that?
 Like the offer might not even work like we got a good at cranking out offers and try this and try this and try this and try this
 That try this hook try this story try this and like it's the game is played by those who really need to put out a whole bunch of stuff
 Quickly and tested till you find the winners, you know
 Ditch the losers keep the winners and then keeps you know scale and go double down on the winners and so
 It really is like if you don't love this game if you don't love it, you're gonna struggle in it because it's not just like
 You promote my thing. I'll put your thing both make a bunch of money and we'll take the rest of the you know the quarter off
 It's like no, it's it's it's more pure now
 And I love it and I'm grateful for it and I hope you guys love it as well
 You know it's been interesting. I you know everyone's got like their their role in this world
 And I really feel like my one of my roles is to make this whole marketing thing fun for people
 you know like I remember going these events back in the day and
 And I would love them I'd be sitting in these room
 and there's all these old people and the people are on stage talking about their successes and what they're doing and
 Direct response and direct mail and newspapers and tear sheets all these things
 I would like and most rooms just bored out of mine like
 You know like trying to figure out how they're gonna do the thing and I'm sitting there in the back like freaking out like
 Like this is so exciting. Do you guys you listen to what people are saying like this is the most exciting thing in the world
 I was like the excited kid in the back and I was like why are people able like how are they able to sit there all like
 Like quietly and take notes like I'm freaking out right?
 And it was funny because I was like maybe I'm wrong
 So I tried like sit in the culture and just you know sit there and take notes and I hate taking notes
 I'm not a note taker right?
 I'm someone who like who listens to get inspired I see a vision this so I see the vision that it's like it's in my head
 Like I can go and run and execute on it
 And so and I always felt weird like why can I like I'm not taking notes like why am I not taking notes and everyone else's and
 I would take notes and I never look at him again
 I'm like I don't understand this and I remember going to my very first Tony Robbins event and
 I remember I showed up at the backpack my laptop and I thought I would sit in the back and take notes
 Well, Tony was talking and you have Tony's event, you know, there's no table
 Everyone's jumping in your years, you know, you're jumping around is crazy. I remember sitting there with my lot
 You know, I come my laptop hung in my chair. I'm like, I'm so embarrassed like I'm the only one with the laptop
 You're like this is different. There's energy. There's momentum
 There's like you see a vision and like you you try to like anchor to your body with the energy and excitement and
 I remember seeing Tony's stuff and then seeing the marketing
 I was like I feel like my my job is this blend in the middle where it's like I need to make marketing fun and exciting and like
 Real for people because if I can make this fun
 like this is the most exciting game in the world, right?
 I go these other events where everyone's bored and half asleep I go to Tony's event was jumping around and and
 It was awesome
 But wasn't you know his personal development and I was like how do we take this personal development energy and plug it into the market
 Which I feel like is the most exciting like
 Amazing thing on planet earth and how do we plug these things together and you know?
 I feel like that's what funnel hacking live has become I've tried to create this thing where it's it's it's half Tony Robbins
 It's half Dan Kennedy, but it's this blend in the middle where it's Russell Brunson and like
 excitement and passion and energy that you feel the personal development conference with like direct response marketing we learn from Kennedy
 Wrapped into like this experience where it's like it's both of those and so those who came to fun like live you felt both of those things
 But man, I feel like my role is really to make this exciting for it because if you love this game
 You will be successful and you will change people's lives if you're like indifferent about the game
 Like I just want to help people like I just want to I just want to make money you're gonna struggle
 If you're if you just want to make money you're gonna struggle if you just want to get your like
 I just want to sell my product for my product
 You're gonna struggle when you become obsessed with the game the game of marketing
 This whole thing right and like creating hooks and stories and offers and plugging him out there and putting him out there and having fun
 Like when you become obsessed with that piece of this?
 That's when you're gonna thrive. That's you know
 It's it's been amazing because of these networks like Facebook and Instagram and Google and YouTube and and the other ones out there
 It's it's taken away
 The good always club is taken away all these other things and it's made it where it's like those who love this game
 Those who are obsessed with this game they win
 Right and your product and your service will will add to the obsession right like I was talking to Stacy Martino this morning
 Who you know they run relationship development.org and she spoke about like I have twice and like they help people with their marriages and like
 That's their product right and they're obsessed with their product
 They've also become obsessed with the marketing of their product and that's why they've grown so much
 That's why I'm so much success like when you become obsessed with the marketing of your thing
 Then your thing will have life. It'll give it breath
 It'll give it the ability to change and serve and like and like you know change people's lives
 but
 If you are just obsessed with your product, it's never gonna get out there
 You got to become obsessed with this game
 So my goal my role is to get you obsessed with this game make it so much fun when you wake up every morning
 You're like alright. Let's make new landing pages make new offers put in new Facebook live is try to try videos try hook
 Let's try a story. Let's try like a thing and when you become like when that becomes your art
 That's how you that's to become amazing in this game. So anyway, I'm gonna keep doing this
 I'm gonna keep getting you guys pumped and inspired and excited about marketing about direct response marketing, right?
 This thing that has been boring for the last century. I'm trying to make it sexy
 I'm trying to bring in person levelment and Tony Robbins and energy and excitement to it because if I can make you excited by it
 then
 Then you'll be able to get your your mission your message your your thing out there and now is the best time to do it because all of the
 All of the popularity contests are done Zuckerberg doesn't care about anything other than
 Then if you're if people are clicking on your ads and if they're enjoying the experience if they are you win
 And if not you lose and so you've got to be good enough
 You've got to become obsessed with it
 You've got to become a student of this game and the more you do that more fun
 You're gonna have the more money you're gonna make and the more people's lives are gonna change
 Which is why we really do this when it all is boiled down when it all gets boiled down
 So I hope they help somebody today
 I'm gonna keep doing my thing and keep making this game exciting and I hope that you catch the fire
 If you can catch the fire this game
 It'll it'll be a fun thing for you and so please catch the fire. I'll keep preaching
 I'll keep getting you excited to keep plugging and keep listening and the more you get excited by the game
 All the other things will come the impact the influence the money will come as you get obsessed with this game of marketing
