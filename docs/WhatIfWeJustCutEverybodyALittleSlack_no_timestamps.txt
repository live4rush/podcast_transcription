 Hey everybody, this is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to a late night marketing seekers podcast
 It's Halloween. I've got an in turkey treating and
 Dropped off Blake who's been filming behind the scenes of everything this last week in the hotel
 I'm driving home and I want to share with you guys some thoughts
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right everybody so this is probably less of a marketing thing and more of a life thing
 I hope you don't mind if I share this but it was on my mind a little bit as I've been having so much fun
 My kids so we had that Halloween tonight, which it's crazy like I
 I used to love Halloween. It used to be my favorite holiday by far. I think I'm I've
 Recently transitioned from the Halloween of my favorites now the 4th of July just cuz like fireworks like the age
 My kids are now like fireworks. I think are more fun
 But last year I didn't I didn't know that was gonna happen so like last year my kids started wrestling
 And so wrestling practice happens you know till like 5 30 every night. I'm gonna be six
 And so last Halloween that's what was happening. You know get on the wrestling practice race home and in my head
 I'm like I'm gonna wear my new Batman costume, which if you guys listen to my bad man costume
 It is amazing, but it takes like an hour at least to put it on
 So I was like I'm racing home
 I'm like I don't have my Batman costume in I'm kind of like bum because I wanted to wear that I was so excited for it
 They get home and the kids are eating at these crazy and awesome doorbell rings
 I'm like a trigger trainer so run the door and it's my daughter's friend and she's like oh can Ellie come trick or treating with me and
 I like it. I don't even know how to explain what happened. I get broke my heart
 And I didn't want I was like no like this is this is my holiday
 I think my wife's like no this is the kids holiday
 I was like no and I was like like broke my heart and so we let her go with her friends
 And then and then the boys wanted to go with their friends
 And so I went dropped one of our twins off and so ended being one of the twins Nora who fell asleep in the car
 As we're dropping the kids the other kids off and then eight and went out and I remember like it was the most depressing day of my life
 I'm not gonna lie like I took them trick or treating and I fell asleep in the car
 Give me a nor we're slipping the car
 What caught took the ones out and I was just like I was so bummed because I was like this is my holiday and my kids stole it from me
 But alas I finally grew up and I realized it's their holiday
 So this year I was more prepared for us like it's me good. They went their friends were okay with that to Nora out
 It was really fun
 She's still a super cute age at least I got one baby who still loves me and all the rest of them were out with their friends
 But anyway, so that's what just ended tonight and I'm not gonna lie I'm beat up and worn out my beautiful wife such a good sport
 We had Blake come and film the whole thing and she's not a big fan of being on camera all the time
 But come on we're doing vlogs
 We needed we need a document us dressing up and she even got a costume and everything was for us
 She's amazing to put up with my
 With my with me. I can imagine me married me. Can you imagine me married to me?
 I gotta be so annoying
 Anyway, but I love her and I'm grateful for so for any any of the spouses of the crazy entrepreneurs. Thank you for
 for putting up with your your spouse because I
 Know it's not it can't be easy. I can't even imagine
 Yeah, so I'm grateful for my wife and I'm grateful for all the wives and the spouse
 I always tell people you can only be as successful as your spouse will allow you to be in
 Cleft an amazing sport for doing all that you really know she doesn't want to but
 That's the one we'll talk about today. I'm actually talking about yesterday. So yesterday
 Hey, sorry to jump in the middle of the podcast episode by Mac home
 I actually finished recording this whole episode and I got home and
 The rest of it just didn't make that much sense and I tried to re-record it and it make much sense
 So I'm jumping on again the third time to kind of finish out this this episode
 Because something really powerful and profound I want to share but for some reason I can't
 Explain it's one of those things where like you experience something and then you try explaining it doesn't really make sense
 It was like you had a moment
 So I'm just sharing through the moment and then the insights and again, it may not make any sense to you, but hopefully
 Hopefully it'll give you guys a little glimpse of what I would experience yesterday, but we went to this the school carnival at the kids
 It's that middle school and we get there and all you know
 I look kids run off and they're doing a million things all their friends and then me collect and my little Nora had a chance to go out and
 to hang out and then we went out to the field and she wanted to
 Go run across the field and I was like, okay, let's go. So we start running and we got all the way to the goal post and all the way back and
 So we're running she's just laughing hysterically and she's so cute
 I look over and I just see her face and I see her laughing and
 Just one of those moments where I time just froze. I'm just saying this is such a cool
 it's a cool experience right to see your little daughter laughing and happy and and
 The experience I've been trying to explain to you guys that I'm just struggling to kind of get out
 It's like as I was watching her laugh for like just a split second. I had this really
 Like a really cool realization
 Where I realized once again that
 Everybody in this world was once a kid just like Nora, right?
 Even the people that like drive us crazy like I think like the people I love the people I admire, you know people look up to
 All of them like not that long ago were little kids like Nora right running around just without a care in the world
 And then on the same side of the people I love and mire and look up to it
 Also the other side of people that drive me nuts people I don't agree with people that you know
 I don't agree with them personally or you know, I'm out believe the political beliefs or religious beliefs or whatever and
 but the gift I was given it I don't know how to explain it to you guys but as I was as I was looking at her I just realized that
 everyone once was a child like her and
 It made me just kind of look at people differently for a little bit
 I started realizing that the people that drive me nuts. I'm like they're just like little kids and
 they were a little kid not that long ago and
 You know they may believe different than me because of the life experiences because of the things that they experienced
 You know it could be their parents screwed them up or it could be you know the group people they got into or maybe I'm the screw-up
 One, I don't know, but it just made me
 Have a different level of love and appreciation for for everyone in that moment and I just want to kind of show
 With you guys because I think so often we we give people such a hard time people that believe differently than us, you know
 I know the political seasons are probably coming in soon. I don't track it close, but man when when the last political stuff happened
 It was like war every single day and everyone's hating each other. It's like it's like oh my gosh
 I should step back and realize that like the reason why someone's on the left or someone's on the right
 You know they didn't care about that 10 15 20 years ago however long
 But you know when they were little kids like Nora
 But because of how they grew up because of their parents and their situation and you know all sorts of things
 That's why they believe that way and so
 You may feel they're wrong or I may feel they're wrong, but same time it's it's
 doesn't
 doesn't mean they're bad right and
 same thing with
 religious beliefs the same thing with
 just all aspects of our lives and I
 Don't know I just after after seeing her I just in my mind as like I want to be more tolerant of people
 I want to be more loving and people I want to respect them for who they are because they're all children of God like just like little Nora here running around and
 That's not thinking about like our callings right like everyone who's listening to this podcast
 He'd been following me for more than five minutes. You know that I don't believe business is just about selling stuff
 Right, I believe that we are called to these to these these calling that we're doing our actual callings like me
 in our team building click funnels and training entrepreneurs isn't just because we're trying to make money
 It's because we feel like there's a higher calling the fact that the dry bar comedy club where Andrew Warner interviewed me for two hours
 On the click funnel startup story. He asked like do you guys believe that this is like inspired by God?
 I was like oh, yeah a hundred percent like no doubt in the slightest
 I'm like we definitely think this is a spiritual thing for us like we're we're doing our best to serve
 To serve the people we have at the highest level we're able to and we are by far not perfect like
 You know we screw up so many times and you know always give the best service all time
 You know with some customers leave angry or you upset or whatever
 But man we try hard like if you guys knew how hard I tried at every angle every direction
 and
 And I just think about it's like as we're serving like we shouldn't care about
 But people believe like what they're you know I mean like we should serve selfishly like selflessly that's better
 We're like serve without worrying about that right?
 It's interesting. I hope she doesn't mind me sharing this one of my close friends and
 some I admire and look up to so much as Liz Betty so me as no Liz and
 It was interesting when I first met her
 And she joined our coaching program. This is probably I don't know three or four years ago now and she told me this
 So Liz and she's got a beautiful wife Christy and and
 You know you guys know that I'm a Mormon
 I remember the church of Jesus Christ loudest saints and and she told me when she was applying through our through my thing
 I there's a video that me telling the story about how
 How God changed my life and and I and I talked about God in this video and she told me she was scared to apply
 She's like what if you know Russell Russell talked about God
 What if he would if he won't want to work to me? What if he looks down on me or whatever you know and and
 Man and there who knows maybe a time of life that I you know, I don't know who knows hopefully not
 I hope I never have better would be that that way, but you know she came in
 I was like, I don't I don't care what you
 Bull you know like that's not my purpose like like my job is to serve
 In the best of my capacity anybody who's willing to listen to my voice, right? And I shouldn't be
 you know pushing people aside because of
 Sexual orientation or because of political beliefs or religious beliefs or anything right like that's not my my choice
 Like I have so many things I struggle with like I should not be the one
 trying to like
 Fix people's
 Things you I mean like that's not up to me like my job is like here
 Russell, this is your sphere of influence. This is a platform you've been given like everyone who comes to you serve them at your highest level
 regardless of any of those things
 and I was like if if I was to try to cast judgment or doubt or whatever on people for whatever that they're
 The thing is they're struggling with like man
 I think about all the things I struggle with and what if what if the mentors and people I was seeking help from
 Didn't want to help me because
 Because I'm a Mormon right or because I believe this way because I'm struggling with this addiction or this problem or this this thing right like
 We I don't think we have the rights or we shouldn't be the ones who who are
 We get those things because we're not perfect ourselves right like so why should we be the ones coaching everybody on all these things like
 I feel like we're giving these platforms to serve anyone and everyone who who comes to us at our highest level like no matter
 We're able to do and I think
 You know yesterday in that moment with Nora as I was looking at her and seeing her laugh and I was just got this this
 Weird love for everybody where I was just like oh my gosh like I need I just need to
 Like any prejudice is anything at that that I have in my mind
 I need to get rid of them and look at everybody through this lens of like oh my gosh
 This is someone who's just trying to figure this out trying to figure out this whole game the same way I am
 and I can't cast my
 My preconceived notions or judgments upon them. It's not my job. It's my role my role is to serve
 Each person and look back at Liz
 Oh, and I had a chance was fun
 I hadn't heard from her for a while and she boxed me yesterday
 I was just talking about everything she's doing the people she's serving how much success she's having how many people's lives
 She's changing in it and like it was such a special moment
 I'm like so grateful that first off. She was willing to apply even I know she had to fear
 She told me that there was fear of that. I know that
 I'm grateful that people my team didn't cast any judge on a grateful. I didn't catch children and grateful it
 We looked at her as we look at anybody and just said look we're gonna do our best to serve her our highest level because
 She's she's special. She's got a gift. She's got a she's got the ability to affect other people's lives
 And I think that if we start looking everyone around us that way
 it'll help us to
 To not judge them because of their political beliefs or judging because of their religious beliefs or
 Judging because they believe something or they do something different than we do
 everyone's got their own demons inside their you know inside themselves and and and
 and
 You know until
 What's the parable if you if you read the Bible is a parable, you know whoever's whoever's
 Perfect to mind you go cast the first stone and I'm like I'm not perfect. I'm my cast in these stones
 Because I don't want those things coming back at me, right?
 Instead it's it's in your sphere of influence serve sort of the best you can so
 Anyway, I don't know if that makes any sense if that helps you guys at all. I hope it does
 I just know for me
 I had this really rare amazing glimpse singing my daughter and then in this instant. I was just like I saw everybody
 As her and I was like man everyone here
 You know 10 years ago 15 20 30 how many years back was just like Nora is right now and
 I love Nora so much and I was just like I need to love everybody that much because if I do I can truly
 have an impact on them and
 if I'm
 not careful I look at
 People the you know through this other lens. It's gonna hold myself back
 So anyway, it was really reminded for me just to understand
 You know my mantle my calling my job my profession my career whatever you want to call it
 That I'm called to serve all people and anyone who's who can hear my voice who's willing to come towards me
 I'm gonna do my best to serve them the highest level I can
 Regardless of anything else and so I'm grateful for everyone great for those of you guys who are listening to this grateful
 Also for your willingness to go out and and get your message out there, right?
 That's a scary thing and as you will find
 Two things will you'll find as you start putting your message out there. It's funny Stephen Larson shared one of them yesterday at the we the
 The telethon he's like as soon as you go you publish he's like the second you go up and you start doing your thing
 Instantly every character fly you have is gonna smack you in the face like that's the best thing about business as soon as you start
 Putting yourself out there all your character flaws become like whoo right in your face, right?
 Scary as number one number two then the critics come fast and
 They don't want they want to silence you as quick as they can
 But man, I'm grateful for those guys who are willing to step up every single day in spite of those things in spite of the fact that
 And starting a business will bring every character flaw you have to the surface and you're gonna be super hyperware
 Things that do one of that big of a deal before suddenly become a big deal because you are the leader
 You are the the person who's putting yourself out there, right? And number two the critics when they come
 Man, it's it's it can be scary. I promise you that I will get critics from this podcast
 I'll get messages people who I can't leave talked about God in the podcast
 I can listen to marketing not because you know like I will get that I get it to get every single time
 But it's like it doesn't matter right like this is my message. I'm sharing it and I'm sharing it and
 I'm grateful for you guys who will do the same things as well because
 It's scary. It's rare
 Man when you do it. It's it's why you're here. So
 Know that keep being bold keep being brave keep putting a message out there
 You know get rid of any judgments or things you have out there because that's not your your role your role is to serve your
 highest level to all people who will hear your voice and
 If you do that you so serve selflessly selflessly make sure I say that right
 You'll be able to have the impact you really want. So there you go for all those who I offended today
 I'm so sorry for those who heard my message and understand it
 Thank you, and I hope that you able to look at people the same way I had a chance to see people yesterday when I was looking at Nora
 So thanks everybody. Appreciate you all have a great night and we will talk to you again tomorrow
