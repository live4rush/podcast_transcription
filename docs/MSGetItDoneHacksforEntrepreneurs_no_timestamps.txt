 Welcome to the Marketing Secrets Podcast. My name is Russell Brunson and I'm what you
 call a serial entrepreneur, but with a twist. You see 50% of my time I'm the CEO of ClickFunnels
 helping over a hundred thousand brands to grow their companies with funnels and the other
 50% of my time I'm actually in the trenches using ClickFunnels to grow the startups I
 believe in. During this podcast I'll take you behind the scenes and show you how we
 are bootstrapping ClickFunnels and my other businesses from startup to nine figures and
 beyond. Welcome to the show.
 Hey, good morning everybody. This is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the Marketing Secrets
 Podcast. It's crazy we are about 30 days away from Funnel Hacking Live. This is where
 the rubber meets the road so it becomes real. All year long I'm like, oh we have 364 days
 of Funnel Hacking Live. Oh we got you know 10 months of Funnel Hacking Live. Oh we got
 six months and then all of a sudden it's here. It's like honest so we are scrambling. I'm
 just getting all the things ready and you know the last minute things. It's always stressful
 because like I think 25 or 30% of our tickets get sold in the last like 20 days or something.
 So we're always scared prior like oh no no the vent room is not going to be filled and
 sure enough the very end everyone starts signing up finally. So we sold the 100 and almost
 150 tickets yesterday which is great and so now it's just cranking up the speed and all
 the promotional stuff but I have to get back in promo mode while I'm in event creation
 mode and slide writing mode and plus all the others you know it's just it's a chaotic time
 but it's fun. My wife's leaving town for 10 days and then it'll have to do it. She's
 leaving the country to go to the chivalry tree which I'm actually really excited for
 to go on with her sister and it's gonna be good but anyway the next 30 days is gonna
 be intense and so for me to be able to handle all that I'm trying to like structure my routine
 and keep very tight with it and so anyway it's been fun. My routine also my diet because
 like a lot of times what happens is I'll be leading into fun hiking live and like I think
 it's so chaotic I start eating like crazy and like getting like 30 pounds and then you
 know all the pictures of fun hiking live I'm overweight and the people make fun of me
 and the ad comments for the next like year of my life and anyway it's all sorts of chaos
 and so I've also got like make sure that I'm losing weight you know staying on staying
 my weight targets getting all my content down and making sure the projects moving forward
 it's just it's it's crazy and it's like we're starting wrestling seasons I'm gonna do
 rest and practices the night or through rest and practice the week with Bowen who's gonna
 be senior this year's wrestling and anyway it's just a lot of stuff but I'm excited and
 woke up this morning came in and got some cool things done so I want to share with you guys
 actually something that hopefully will be helpful for you especially if you're a writer
 a content creator because for me like we're doing all these things right and just it's
 hard to like people always ask me how do you get so much stuff and what's the secret like
 what's the process and so I'm gonna share with you guys I want my secrets how you get
 so much stuff done if you're cool with that and it's not a it's not a perfect process
 so I will state that yeah but it's it's a it's working really really well and you know
 if you think I get a lot of stuff done this is one of the reasons why so a couple things
 are one is I can mention this on a podcast or something a little while ago but I recently
 got rid of social on my core phones I bought a second phone I call my social phone I leave
 that at the other at the main office and it's got all the social apps there and so I have
 a chance to go and stay and look at social but it's not in my pocket all the time that's
 given me like three or four hours a day back in my life so there you go there's like for
 most of us like that alone will change your life so I got rid of social off my core phone
 that was really big number two is that on my core phone okay it can really do is like
 box send emails record podcast or listen to podcast and so that's only it's really happening
 on this real phone so it's giving me chance to I say podcast also audiobooks so it's giving
 me chance to listen a lot more stuff like I literally finished the fountain head this
 weekend which was awesome and like five or six of the podcast like I'm actually learning
 more like social I don't learn I just scroll where's podcast an audiobooks I'm actually
 I think I'm improving myself and so it's taking those times I used to waste on just
 dumb stuff and I'm like using to improve myself which is awesome so there's there's one little
 hack the new hack that I did is so this is cool there's a company out there it's called
 free write F R E W R I T E and I just found out about them recently but this is cool if
 you're trying to create content or specifically trying to write the question how many guys
 are writers or you've tried to write it's hard right you open Google Doc and you start
 writing one of the problems is if you look at the way your brain works right we have
 our right brain or left brain and probably messes up the right brain I believe like our
 creative side or left brain is like our analytical side and so one of the biggest problems you
 have when you're writing you should know to blame out a paper and you should be creative
 you should writing as you're writing you see typos you see mistakes and you like and see
 switch from like this creative brain to an editing brain you edit and you go back to
 creative and back to edit and back to back back back and like that that flipping of the
 switch from creative to editing creative to editing right to left right to left right
 to left is what kills most writers is why we we spend three hours and write two paragraphs
 right it's because we're so focused trying to edit the best writers I was talking about
 like the secret is word count like getting down into word count I've heard people who've
 done all sorts of crazy things from like like taping paper over their monitors they can't
 see what they're writing to you know doing a blindfolded like all sorts of stuff to keep
 themselves in the creative mind versus shifting back to the analytical editing mind and so
 I've tried things like that in the past the thing that when I write my books it works
 the best for me actually is I try to like stimulate all my senses because I have an
 A to D brain so with A to D if you're trying to focus on one thing at a time it's almost
 impossible but the folks in a lot of things it becomes a lot easier so when I'm writing
 my books for example I get a standing desk I get a treadmill desk and so I get a treadmill
 desk I use brain.fm I listen to these these binaural beats my my headphones I'm walking
 and I'm writing all the same time and so by doing like five things at once it forces
 me to just write I can't like search can't Google can't edit I can't like talk I can't
 just like me because I'm walking on a treadmill desk while I'm writing while my ears are listening
 to binaural beats while I'm doing it it just it's the way that they like shortcuts me and
 focuses forces me to actually write so that's what my little hacks for me as I may have seen
 you do that on YouTube or whatever but that's been a big one for me but this is this new
 one is cool okay this tool called free write I actually bought two of them I bought one
 is a it looks like a typewriter is called the Hemingway and the ones the free write travel
 companion so it's like a smaller keyboard that you travel with it's crazy when you look
 at it actually reading the company stuff I think they said that initially they did this
 they didn't put a backspace and they didn't want you to be able to backspace they just
 wanted to be able to write and so you sit down and you start typing and it's like it
 looks like a typewriter it's a little tiny screen so you can see what you're typing but
 you can't really edit it there's a backspace button that's it you can kind of scroll around
 if you need to but it's it's a pain in the butt so much so that you just wouldn't write
 and and so you sit down you start writing and the goal is just to write and be stuck in
 creative mode you just write right right right right right and then you're done there's a
 button says send you click send and it sends it to your Google Drive it emails it to you
 it like it'll send it you know wherever you set up and tell it to send to them and it
 stores it on folder so it's just stored on your thing so you can go back and add to it
 or change your add more but when you're writing click send it boom it shows up and you've got
 this thing and so you know I bought a I bought the Hemingway typewriters to have in my office
 here my study office and I bought a travel one so that if I do like it when I start traveling
 I can use this more often but anyway so far it's kind of cool and I know there's like
 this weird romance of like having the typewriter and writing in it and like that feeling you
 know like writers like Hemingway would have done back in the day back when when writing
 was an art form and not something that we have AI do for us you know I mean and so it's
 kind of cool so I this weekend I got I got them I got them here I got them all set up
 and I was like I'm gonna write something and I know what to write so I'm like I'm not
 I don't like want to write chapter one so writing a book I was like I just want to write
 but I'm like I don't even know like how to write or what to write and so I just wrote
 basically a letter to myself about my thoughts I guess is what people do in the journal I'm
 not a journal or but I think this is maybe what they do in the journal so sat down and
 I wrote and there's insane amounts of titles I can tell you but I got done I clicked send
 it yet emailed to myself and it sent it to Google Docs and this morning I got in the
 Google Docs looked at I was like this isn't not bad it's not perfect it's a lot of editing
 but my first shot was like anyways really encouraging so I'm gonna go and start doing
 this every day I'm gonna build in my morning routine every morning I come to the office
 and I study I study my scriptures I read some other books and then from there I jump back
 online I start working the rest of my day but I'm gonna weave in like 20 minutes 30 minutes
 at the end of my study session or I'm just gonna write and I don't know what I'm writing
 about yet it might be based on a book I'm working on it could be based on you know just
 a journal I don't even know yet who knows but this first one's done it's kind of cool do
 you want me to read to you I'm kind of proud of it so again it's not perfect but it was
 me if I'm working on my funnel hacking live presentation which by the way if you don't
 have your ticket yet go to funnel hacking live dot com but my intro presentation I'm really
 working on like in the last couple years I usually talk about success I talk about heroes
 journey I talk about drift versus driven as my presentation last event and like a couple
 things I kind of balance between but she's something based on personal development so
 I was trying to think what I want people to understand what I want to convey and how
 I want to say it so that's my thoughts that I was writing this is just like what I want
 to say in my my intro presentation for funnel hacking live so again this is not this is
 half a day to be sitting down a typewriter 11 o'clock a night after I got set up so
 you take it with a great assault but I'm kind of proud of what turned out so I'm going
 to read to you because this is probably one place is over every single day and it'll be
 you know dust on my hard drive till 200 years now some kid buys my company finds it
 maybe shares it somewhere who knows something becomes like me and does that so anyway here
 we go so so I typed I said my thoughts for my secrets of success presentation I want
 to take people on a journey their journey in the hero that thousand faces Joseph Campbell
 calls that they're called to adventure I believe this isn't just something that people
 do but something they're actually called to do I don't want it to sound vague but I'm afraid
 that if I tell them who is giving them this calling someone think I'm crazy and ignore
 it I probably would have ignored it the first time to it wasn't until I've been involved
 in creating my movement to liberate and educate entrepreneurs for several years before someone
 else pointed out to me I always assumed that my mission and my spiritual beliefs were separate
 I didn't believe that God cared about what I was actually doing as long as I was being
 a good person it never crossed my mind that he placed those desires in my heart that he
 was one who actually called me and that my role is to be a good steward of the thoughts
 and impressions and ideas that he places inside my mind those who pursue these columns with
 all their heart my mind and soul are people that I call the driven the driven of those
 who dream dreams and see visions they are as Al Sharfen once said the small percentage
 of the population goes into the future imagines in your reality comes back to the present
 and insists that it becomes real the driven of those who have confidence to move forward
 because they keep their own promises they make to themselves when they decide to do
 something they cut off all other options move forward with definiteness of purpose when
 the resistance comes they may struggle as all men do they decided before it in faith faith
 in the calling that they have faith in the guide or the mentors they've chosen and faith
 in themselves those who feel the resistance and act in fear instead of faith they are
 the ones who Napoleon Hill calls drifters they are sent back to their ordinary world
 they stop moving forward in the pursuit of their definite purpose the resistance will
 pass by them and load them away into carnal security they've once again lied to themselves
 and lost the very confidence required to be successful.
 Alright so there you go there's my stream of thought on my typewriter on the free right
 the very first time so what do you think was good was bad any good for you in there?
 Anyway I have this vision this picture in my head of what I'm trying to convey and talk
 about and so that was kind of my first time actually putting pen to paper fingers to keyboard
 so from here I'll keep massaging I'll probably write three or four more versions of this
 and then from there I'll start working on my PowerPoint slides which is exciting so anyway
