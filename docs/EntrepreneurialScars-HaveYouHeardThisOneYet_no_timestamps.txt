 Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson and welcome you back to the marketing seekers podcast and
 Today's episode is actually gonna be a little different because it's gonna be a reboot. I'm actually not gonna record a new podcast episode because
 I've been here with my inner circle members for the last couple days. I've been celebrating a lot of their successes and
 It's been interesting though. It feels like there's been a theme over
 Recently with a couple entrepreneurs who I work close with who've been struggling and things like that and for all of them
 I was like have you listened to the entrepreneurial scars podcast and they're like no, what's that and I'm like how have you not heard this?
 And I think it's been almost two two years or so since I published that that episode
 But I wanted to bring it to the top because I know it's something that so many people are struggling with and there's so much fear and
 Anxiety and which is something I could make everybody listen to once a week or once a month
 And so because that what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just do a reboot and we come back from the theme song
 I'm gonna replay that episode of the podcast. Hopefully
 Hope any of you guys who are in a season of struggling right now with your business with your life
 And hopefully give you guys permission and you need to move forward and feel comfortable and
 And to be able to go back and get back to change in the world
 So with that said I'm cute with theme song when we come back we listen to a podcast called entrepreneurial scars
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everyone, so I wanted to I honestly this podcast I just want to hang out with you guys and talk because
 it's been interesting is I've been working with some of my entrepreneurs and
 and
 Recently just as I've been working with some people and watching
 people who had insane amounts of success at one time and then who had something happen a failure a bankruptcy
 Whatever like just fill in the blank
 That the second time around a lot of times they really really struggle and I start looking at like why are they struggling because like they had this
 Your success it's almost like there they have fear and embarrassment of like I failed in the past and they and
 As I kept talking about this with some of the guys on our team
 I was like it's almost like they have entrepreneurial scars and like and it's interesting is that us as the person went through the
 process and the failure and the
 You know a lot of times there's ups then the downs they are like we have these scars like these emotional scars
 But I think sometimes we feel like those scars like on our faces and other people can see them
 What is interesting is that people don't like those are just things that are that are inside of your yourself that are
 But because they're there because you feel like they're there and you feel like people can see it
 It keeps you from having success the next time because you're there's so much fear around these scars these these things
 Um and as I was as I was talking about this this morning
 I shared a story and this whole thing kind of tidies things together a little better for you
 They're not gonna name names or anything, but there's a guy I know and he was a successful politician top of his game
 Like doing everything amazing and just people loved him
 And and when you saw him in that in that spot like and this is not like national politics
 I don't know any national politics. I don't follow politics at all
 But from like it was a local person right and you saw him when on the news and all the stuff and he was like he was dynamic
 He was charismatic and like everything was awesome and then
 He got caught up in this like political scandal whatever right and it's funny
 Because I don't get I don't fall Paul. Thanks much on camera much
 But I did I wasn't where like all this thing happened
 And he's no longer in there and that someone else and then fast for like three or four years later
 I met him and was interesting as I met him it was in different situation wanted talking about business stuff
 I was really excited. I was like oh, I know who this person is like how cool like I want to I want to meet him and talk to him
 And as I talked to him like it was funny. How funny I shouldn't say that it was interesting to see like
 The scars he'd gotten from this in from this thing
 Were so deep that like it was he was struggling to progress in other parts of his life and business and like all these other things because
 Of the scars he got from this this thing that didn't work out right right and they yeah
 You look at the thing it was it didn't it wasn't good, but like you know three years later. I
 Am almost surprised that I knew about it, but I did but
 He was carrying those scars in this conversation with me with you it came in like the way that I'd seen him before
 Like confident and all sorts of things
 I probably would have done the business deal with him
 But because he had these these scars and like just the way you approached
 He didn't have a certainty and didn't have all these things they were gone
 And I could feel it and like that uncertainty kept me from doing the deal with them
 And and I remember thinking after I finished that I was like calling I
 Can tell he's still carrying around the fear and the embarrassment in the shame of this thing
 But I'm like I don't care about that thing
 I couldn't care less like move on in your life and come back because like that person that I saw on TV
 You would approach me that way I would have done this deal and the same thing is true in entrepreneurs
 Like there's someone who I know who's super successful who
 How to funnel blew up and a ton of money and then it went away and now they're kind of struggling
 And what's interesting is like I kind of know that backstory because I know the person things like that
 But even with I look at that person like this person's a a me like as a rock star
 I think they're awesome. They're they're amazing
 But as I as I see them and interact with other people
 I see that these scars that that this person has are keeping them from from from taking over the next thing
 And it's funny because like I don't think 99.9% of every single person in the world has any idea
 Those scars are there for this person
 But because he knows that they're there because he know he failed
 He knows that things disappeared and didn't work out the way he wanted
 He has his fear and as he's approaching the next situations
 He's struggling because of that because of these scars and I think it's interesting
 That these entrepreneurial scars that we have like first off they're invisible like nobody sees them like I
 You know some people may be aware of them, but nobody sees them
 Except for you and so because you are so aware of these things that keeps you from having the confidence and the success you need to move forward and
 It's funny. I was talking to
 an entrepreneur who was about to go through bankruptcy and they're freaking out they're so scared and and
 and I kind of asked them why and and they'd say you know because I don't want those scars
 But like what they said afterwards like if I have bankruptcy like no more like what's my wife gonna think I'm and my in-laws and my family
 All these all these things I was like you understand that like bankruptcy
 They can think about this like failure for entrepreneurs like the founding fathers of this country gave us bankruptcy as a gift
 So that entrepreneurs like us would risk and try and move forward and and roll the dice and hope for something
 Like if it wasn't for that gift not you may think it's a gift from the founding fathers
 I believe it's a gift from God like it wasn't for that thing America wouldn't succeed as a nation
 Everything that's been amazing wouldn't have happened if entrepreneurs didn't have that risk if it was like do you go bankrupt?
 You go to jail to they pay off all your debts
 Not many people would have taken the risk
 I don't know if I would have taken the risk but because like worst case scenario is bankruptcy
 We clear off your balance sheets you start over like that's the worst case scenario
 That's the greatest gift we have and so like if we hit that and we go through it and all of a sudden
 We have these scars like I went through bankruptcy and you have all this fear then
 You go up the next thing it's like no that that shouldn't be a negative thing
 That means you try it I mean you you tempt it and even if you attempt it had success and it went away
 Like you you've had success
 I remember I was doing a deal with
 This guy who's super successful in fact
 He was consulting things where it's like 500 grand a day with a minimum of of
 10 sessions was like half an week bucks to like get this guy to work with you, right?
 And I had a chance hanging out with him
 I was talking to him and talking strategy and he was asking my story and I'm telling my story and and
 You know, I'm pretty open with things now
 Like I've realized that my scars are what actually draws people to me
 So I fun hacking live I spent an hour half on stage talking about all my failures because it draws people towards me
 And so which is kind of maybe the point at the end of this podcast, but I
 Sure as my up some of my downs and as I told him the whole thing he was like, oh good
 I'm like, what do you mean good? He's like well you cycle to make what do you mean I've cycled he's like oh?
 He's like well, you know entrepreneurs are gonna cycle at least once I refuse to work with him
 I'm like what does that mean? He's like well cycle means you build something up and then you crash
 He's like if you haven't cycled yet, then guess what you're still like you're still reading you're still drinking your own Kool-Aid
 Like you still believe that you are the most amazing human being on earth
 You don't realize until after you've cycled that it's not just you like you aren't the greatest thing to walk this planet
 Like there's market conditions and there's people and there's opportunity and there's luck and there's all these amazing things that happen
 That makes the make you possible right make the make you is not very successful
 And as you said that first up
 I was like I feel is better like cycling sounds way better than failing or quit your bankruptcy
 But but I thought it was interesting that he wouldn't work with an entrepreneur let's say it's cycled once and I was like man
 How many people like they they go out there and they do their big risk and they have some success
 Which gives you like all this pride and confidence and stuff and then you lose it and then because of that failure?
 You never try again or you you try but you're halfway because you feel like you have these scars
 And you feel like other people are judging you or you're judging yourself or all these kind of things where the reality is like we don't see those things
 Nobody knows about the failures until you tell about it. They do know about it
 It doesn't really matter in fact as I found is I share my scars. It draws people closer to me
 I can't mention earlier. I think the reason why people do business with me a lot of times because I'm vulnerable
 I share those things and
 And so for you guys I wanted to to kind of talk about stages first off
 It's okay to have those scars, but don't hide them like share those things when my kids get injured
 They're super cute and they do all the time
 I tell like my boys. I'm like chicks dig scars. That's a good thing
 Like that's awesome like you know black eyes are awesome
 Like when I got I remember one of my black eyes. I got wrestling fact
 I don't think if you guys watch the video like you still see the scars are both my eyes
 I had this one where I hit my buddy's knee and my eye
 Swole shed I had like 15 stitches and I couldn't see on my eye for like four or five days and as I was at school
 I was all embarrassed because the scar and I was walking around people like dude
 I look awesome
 Oh your wrestler like people connected with that more than like me looking good in my hair speaking
 You know worrying about like what I look like and so
 I think the moral of this podcast my want you to understand is that we all have entrepreneurial scarves
 If you don't have me you're gonna have them
 But don't let those keep you from the next success my friend who's a politician like I don't care that what happened
 He could go and do and be successful
 But like because he's carrying these scars
 He's not and you have to be willing to get rid of those or or not get rid of him like
 Embrace him and share those things like look I screwed up
 This is what happened, but this is what I'm doing now and this is what I learned from it how I'm changing
 You know if I look back on my career
 There's a lot of things that I'm embarrassed about things that I messed up on big time
 You know maybe I should podcast something about my biggest regrets
 I have a lot I have regrets in my business there are things that I did that I'm embarrassed about
 I wish I wouldn't have done like looking back now
 I was like I would have consulted myself like do not do that
 But I wouldn't have known the path unless I'd gone down some of these paths and realize the you know what what things were right
 You know I've always tried to be fair to my customers and my employees and stuff
 I made mistakes and I sold things that I thought were really good and found later. They weren't I've done like there's things
 I'm not proud of but if I let those scars keep me like how many people would how many people's lives that we're
 Touching and affecting now that wouldn't have been touched had I gone brace those scars and like it told me like look
 I messed up in the past and I have we all do and it's okay
 But I don't want you guys to not progress because of that
 So hopefully this gives you some comfort and knowing like look if you've gone through a bankruptcy
 That's okay if you if you've messed up if you did something stupid like that's okay
 You know that's what this life is about is not making those mistakes and owning it
 And if you do it's almost like plastic surgery that makes these scars just disappear
 But they don't need to disappear like I said embrace it because that's what's gonna draw people to you
 And so I hope that helps is on my mind today. I thought I wanted to share it so
 Hope that that was good for you guys
 Again as an entrepreneur, you know, we're risking stuff every day risking our our
 Personal I mean we're risking like our names risking money risking other people like you know
 Like I wake up in the morning scared
 We have 119 poise as of today like if I screw up like how many people lives if I let down because of that like those things are real
 They mean I understand that but
 I've got to risk those things because how many people's lives can we affect because of that right?
 And if you've gone through bankruptcy don't let that stress you out
 It's a gift from the founding fathers. It's a gift from goddess given us the ability so that we can risk and not lose everything
 we can risk and
 and
 and
 You know it wasn't for that like again
 Progress would stop if entrepreneurs were risking it's like it's not a bad thing and if you you know like
 Anyway, so I just want to give you guys that as a gift and if you guys are struggling now
 Some of you guys probably are some of us are going through banks for you gone through banks for me
 Maybe it's not banks that you fail you launched me didn't work
 You built the team of people and the product and working to fire people to let them go or you know
 All the ups and the downs and disappointment like it's on fingers
 You have so many things on your shoulders and I get that and I hope that this message just helps release some of that pressure for some of you guys
 Because if you don't keep risking if you don't keep trying if you don't keep getting those scars
 Where's the world gonna be where are you gonna be?
 Where's your family gonna be? Where are the people you're serving gonna be?
 They need you and it's worth the risk. It's worth the sacrifice
 It's worth those fears because if you can affect those people like
 When you when you deliver on what you know you have and you change their life like it it makes it all worth it
 It's interesting just kind of to close this down. I look at where our company has come where we are today, right?
 And it looks back
 During my last cycle
 Seven years ago when everything collapsed around me and I thought the world was coming to an end and I was depressed
 And I was scared and all those kind of things happen
 Looking at now like if I didn't go through that
 Click funnels and this process never would happen. I never would have met Todd
 I never met who built click phones and ever met built this team. I never had this opportunity
 We wouldn't I wouldn't have known the things we know to be able to execute on this. I wouldn't
 A lot of things that we're steering clear from today are because of the mistakes happening late
 You know back then and if I made those mistakes today someone could have been catastrophic
 Way more people's lives could have been affected
 whereas I had a chance to suffer those things and get those scars at a smaller scale and so I
 Don't have to have those things again now. Hopefully if I learn from my lessons, I'm trying to do
 so look at those things as gifts embrace them share them and don't hide from
 because of scars would draw people to you and we all have them and
 Don't let that keep you from from your mission. So hope it helps
 Thanks again for everything guys, and I will talk to you as all soon. Bye everybody
