 What's up everybody this is Russell welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast in today's episode
 I want to share with you guys a principle that
 Napoleon Hill talks about it's one of his laws of success
 It's one of his secrets and also happened to be a hashtag that I think is really really cool that I'm trying to get
 Pushed through the world. So that said
 #overdeliver hashtag do more than you are paid for
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, what's up guys, so yes, I'm still locked in the Napoleon Hill room
 I think I can't get out, but I'm having so much fun. Hopefully, you know eventually my family will send food if they can't find me
 Or come and get me
 But no, I'm just joking. I'm having so much fun in here and
 Anyway, there's a quick principle I want to talk about and you guys hear me talk about this lot, right?
 I always talk about this concept is principle of overdeliver, right?
 We have t-shirts to say hashtag overdeliver
 whenever we are
 like in anything we do like the question like the
 The recurring question we always have when we're doing an event or writing a book or you know creating a newsletter
 Whatever is is how do we overdeliver?
 How do we overdeliver like all people coming into any experience with Russell and being like oh, and I like oh yeah
 I got what I paid for I want people coming and saying man like he completely overdelivered
 I was expecting this and I got so much more right and so that's that's the goal
 It's we're always trying to do with with all the things which is hard cuz especially like fun hacking live right?
 We're about to do we aren't eight or a ninth funnel hacking live and every you're like how to make this bigger
 How to make it better and it's like I have no idea but this year we're gonna do it again
 So if you don't even take it yet by the way go to funnel hacking live calm
 We are getting closer and closer to being sold out. We're less than a hundred days away now, which is crazy
 So go get your tickets, but I digress
 I want all you guys thinking about about overdelivering and everything you're doing and this is true
 Doesn't matter what role you don't have to be an entrepreneur to overdeliver right like with your spouse
 Like if you can overdeliver in relationship with your spouse
 How much more fulfilling that relationship be if you can do with your kids if you can do it with you know
 All sorts of things if you can do with your employers
 And that's interesting in
 The point Hill in his laws of success one of his laws of success. I think it's number two or number three
 the the principal is is
 always do more than you're paid for and
 He also talks about it in this book how to raise your own salary, which it's actually a really good book
 I never want to read this one because I'm like oh like I'm not trying to raise my own salary
 But it's basically Napoleon Hill taking his his 16 laws of success and putting him through
 This process is you know of I've had a regional salary, but he's doing it. It's really cool
 It's like an interview with Andrew Carnegie after he's passed on
 And so it's this really cool dialogue back and forth and anyway, it's worth reading but
 But again in here in the hydration of salary or you know inside the law of success
 It's this principle of like always do more than you're paid for which again is the whole concept of overdelivering
 And it's fascinating to think about this because everyone wants a raise everyone wants to move up the corporate ladder
 They want to get the next thing don't have more success
 I want like all these things you know what most people do in most situations
 You see this especially in school is like people try to do the least possible like like what's you know
 I see with my kids all the time like oh my paper
 You know it's due today
 But like I can turn next week and also get also get credit right or oh, it's supposed to be 10 pages
 If I write five pages, I'll still get credit right like we're always trying to do the least possible to have success
 But if you want to have actual success
 The concept flips right always do more than you're paid for and by doing that what typically happens is the people that you're working for
 Like oh my gosh this person is so much more valuable than I'm paying for them
 I'm getting more value than I'm giving them return. I need to give them more value
 Right like again the title of this book is how to raise your own salary like that's the question like if I works if I
 If I do more than getting paid for then my boss or whoever's I'm working for is gonna see that and then they're gonna want to pay
 More right and even if they don't it's gonna increase your skill set
 And then if that person's not willing or able to see the change not willing to give you a raise
 Whatever then it's okay because it makes you more marketable on the market right and I can go out to the next thing
 And it's funny in thinking grow rich Napoleon Hill shares this principle and I think he said that his secretary
 Or is the system at the time or something or his
 anyway somebody
 Oh, I think there's a person. What do they call him? We're like you're speaking and they're typing
 Back in the day
 I think that was more of a thing than it is nowadays
 But I think the person at work form who's doing that during thinking grow rich
 I currently explain this principle like you need to you know work or do more than your your paid for and
 And then she was she went back and said like oh I
 You know I listened you say that and I did something that actually helped you out and helped me out
 And she was like you know
 I realized that I was just doing what I was being paid for so she's like I wanted to test this principle
 So I started doing more than you were paying me for and I became more skilled like I games other things
 I was working at night and weekends trying to get skill sets so I could do more and I was able to do more and because that you know
 He and you know Napoleon Hill ends up giving her a raise and making her a partner and like all these other things that happen because of that
 Right and so I think the principle for all of us is to look at that and say okay
 Like am I doing what I'm being paid for or am I doing more than getting paid for and again?
 This is true in all aspects of life
 Look at this through the lens of your marriage look at the lens of your kids through your core relationships
 That matter to you to your business to your customers to your employer to your coach to your like whatever it is in any aspect of your life
 This principle is it's powerful. So that's my question for you. Are you?
 Are you doing more than you pay for are you over delivering?
 If you can happen if in a world in society where everyone's trying to do the least possible work and effort
 Inside of that if I just imagine if you and me and all of us can can flip the
 Conversation instead of doing the least possible we start all trying to do the most possible
 What would that do if we over deliver in every situation?
 That's really how we have more success in life, right?
 In my business as we do that, you know as we over deliver in funnel hacking live more people come the next year more people come next year
 I keep telling my team like the first year
 We have less people funnel hacking live than your prior is the last year
 We'll ever do it and luckily for them and for us every year we get more people coming more people come because we over deliver
 And so the people who were there want to come back and they talk about it and the people who weren't there want to come as well
 And so it's really cool and really powerful anyway without said I want to thank you guys so much for listening this episode
 Hopefully I over delivered gave you some insight
 And again if you want to go deep on this the
 Had rage on Saturday in a pony hills a super cool book
 I think you'd enjoy but again he speaks about this principle and basically all those books talking about big and garage
 Lots of success all different places, but something you can apply to every part of your business. Am I doing that?
 That's gonna be one of those invisible things that increase how much money you make how much you're worth
 So always figure out ways to over deliver in every given circumstance in a situation. Hope this helps
