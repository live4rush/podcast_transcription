 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast on today's episode
 I'm gonna share it. Yeah, something kind of interesting at least for me
 I was at a wrestling duel with
 watching my kids Russell and
 Chancing out Chad Woolner who's one of my friends as chiropractors
 you know somebody who's using click funnels and all these philosophies in his chiropractic business and
 And he came up with the principle. I think was really powerful called be a solution curator
 So I'm gonna keep things on we come back and talk about it how it's a different lens look at you and your business
 I think it's gonna help you guys a lot. So that said let's hear the theme song
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, welcome back, I got to give a better way to transition to that. I don't really know but anyway, so
 This was interesting so as you guys know I am
 part-time internet marketing nerd full-time dad and so right now is the kids wrestling season and
 So for me, it's like every day at 230
 I no matter how busy or stressful or anything's right I pack up the office
 I race home put my wrestling shoes and head over to wrestling practice in my boys and it's
 and like the most
 anyone it's my it's my favorite it's
 I don't know if they even like me being there, but I just don't want to miss any second of it
 Today I was driving to school and like there's only two more years so they're graduated like after this year and I'm just like oh
 This is crazy and hard so I'm trying to be as much as I can which hopefully all of you are doing that for your kids as well
 because all those other stuff we're doing is just
 It's just a game that we are participating in trying to burn time until we die like the only thing that actually really matters is our
 families and our kids so
 make sure you spend time for them and carve out the
 The time through busy schedule for things that don't matter and make sure you have time for things that actually do matter
 But anyway inside of that the Saturday we had a wrestling term which I was this week was hard my wife is out of town
 I was like really looking forward to sleeping and
 Getting a break because I'm just learning out
 As I'm sure a lot of you guys are too, but they had a full day rest in terms of Saturday
 So we were up at 5 in 30 in the morning waking kids up driving across town wanes
 It's we'd be at the gym by 6 30 wanes at 7 wrestling start at 9 and then we were in the gym for like 13 or 14 hours
 Well luckily one of my buddies chads his son
 Russell's another team so he was there so it's kind of nice having something to talk to you and
 I asked him what he's been doing like if you've followed if you've read my books
 I've mentioned Chad and most of them from one way or the other
 I
 Just different things that as I was learning these principles and applying them
 You know he was one who took a lot of these ideas and tried him in his chiropractic practice
 Which has been really fun and
 To see how these internet nerd principles can work for a more traditional business and it was interesting because he told me he's like
 Yeah, I've been doing these events and he talked about
 What he teaches his docs to do now and
 I was so fascinating especially for me because you guys probably heard a couple of little episodes ago
 I did an episode about how I feel like my calling is that I'm a curator
 I learned a bunch of stuff and I curate the best and then from there are my books I create software
 We do these things we're curating the best principles and practices from the marketing world and bringing him to you guys
 And Chad said the way he's doing with his chiropractors is he's teaching like you're not actually a chiropractor
 You're not even a marketer what you are is you are a solution
 Curator he said I was like whoa, that's cool. Like wait. Hey, tell me more like what do you tell me like?
 I can explain that to me more he said most docs they look at it is like, you know
 I went to school I learned how to give adjustments so people come to me and I give them adjustments
 I think that's how they look at their at their at their work right?
 And he said their identity is that I'm a chiropractor therefore I do chiropractic services for people and he said that when you start working with
 Doctors more and more he started trying to help them understand like that your your marketers next identity shifted his tribe too
 It's like your marketers like you got a market your business you got to get people coming in so you can serve them
 And that was kind of next wave of identity
 He gave his his chirles was from again from chiropractor to a marketer. He's like but the for him
 He's like the identity that trumps all the rest is a solutions
 Curator what he means is like when somebody comes into your practice like your job is not just to give adjustment your job is
 You get solutions you're looking like what are the problems that what are the big and your whole like goal of mission and vision is to like
 Find solutions for problems and then to curate them together
 That's why people come to you right because you're cute
 You've curated all these different things and making them the best of the best
 Like for example you guys come to me because I've curated through you know
 Hundreds of thousands of hours of books and maybe that's the exaggeration tens of thousands of hours of books and podcasts and practical life
 Application and research and come out and say look this is the best funnel
 This is the best process is now by at like so all my books are a curation of what I've learned and discovered and figured out and
 So for you is whatever role you're in like that's the same thing your solutions
 Curator and so for his docs they come in and out like yes, I'm gonna go and give you an adjustment
 That's one solution. I've curated but I've been doing a lot of study a lot of research and we have supplements and we've got
 These are in protocols and we've got bio hacks and we've got all these different things
 We can offer our our clients when they come in right and the more valuable you are the more likely they're gonna keep coming to you
 The more like they're gonna refer to you and if you're someone who just gives an adjustment like okay
 He gives a good adjustment, but if you come in and like our solutions curator, right?
 We've got all these things I can do testing I can do this I can do like all these different things now you come unique now
 You become monetize yourself now you become something special
 And I think that's true not just in my world where I'm becoming a solutions curator for you guys
 Not just in Chad's world where he's teaching chiropractors to do this but for your business as well think about that
 What you do throughout lens that you're no longer just you know, I teach people blah I do blah like no
 No, no, I the the result people are looking for is this nice
 I curate solutions helping to get that result and it can be all sorts of things right
 We talked about this in the econ versus expert smackdown if you listen that it was like you have to start stop looking at you know
 And for that challenge we did you know people are looking at themselves like oh, I'm I teach people
 You know, I I
 Celebration products right so physical products that's like how people seem to categorize themselves a lot of times in our community
 It's like you know, like you don't do either of those things right like you have a dream customer that you've been called to serve
 And your job now is to serve them and that means in any way this can help me sort of more successful
 So it could be through physical products might be through digital products
 I'm gonna do coaching through supplements through a million different ways you can serve somebody
 So we start looking through your business of like I'm in the business of serving my dream customer. I'm not in the business of
 You know doing whatever like that's when you start having these these big breakthroughs
 And he goes powerful like listening how Chad's been coaching his doctors and helping them understand that I know your solutions curator
 Right same thing like you've got a customer that coming into you like your job is to carry all the different solutions helping have success to be happier to be
 Whatever right and so the same thing it's true for all of you guys think about your business through that lens
 Right, who's your dream customer? What's the big result? I think they're looking for over the big problem that are running away from right?
 And then what are the things you can curate to help them have success inside of that inside of your world right?
 And what's cool about it is this is this opens up all the other things open up your valuator opens up different offers up
 So down so it's cross-sells back in so all those things are happening very very easily when you start looking at what you do differently
 And so as Chad says he was telling me with his chirals
 He's like you have to shift your identity from a chiropractor to a market or two like on the solutions curator
 I do I curate solutions for my tribe for my people
 So hopefully that's been helpful for you guys. I think a lot of times we get so stuck and like I do this thing
 It's like no no no you don't do the same you serve this audience and how can you do it?
 Well, I'm gonna curate as many different solutions and opportunities in ways possible like in my world
 I think about all the things that we've curated for you guys right like what I do is I help entrepreneurs that my dream customers
 Right help them build funnels. That's the end result what I'm trying to do
 But inside of that window we've curated all sorts of stuff. We've got funnel scripts, which is a tool helps right copy
 We've got traffic secrets. We've got
 Live events we have fun hiking live
 We've got you know all these different things we've curated together to help you have more success make it simpler to get
 You community to help your belief. I'm writing a book now on personal development to help you earth your mindset like yeah
 I think it's pretty cool
 So you are a solution curator look at it throughout lens and I think it'll change a lot of things for you
