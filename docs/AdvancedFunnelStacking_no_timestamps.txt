 Good morning everybody. This is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast. Today is webinar day
 I'm excited. Hopefully it's webinar day for you too because webinar day as long as you don't mess it up
 It's usually payday. So got some cool stuff talked about. I'll be right back after the intro
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out of the world and yet still
 remain profitable. That is the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers.
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 Okay, so head to the office today
 Today is webinar day, but it's a special webinar day. I'm excited and I want I had a lesson that I want you to learn from this
 So
 How do I how do I phrase this best so as you guys know we first launched ClickFunnels the way we did it was I did a webinar
 Every single well, I told you we'll do a webinar week for a year
 I was doing like three to five webinars a week sometimes two or three day
 For a year and that's how we will click funnels initially, right?
 They give us initial momentum to get things into outer space and and then over the you know over time
 We've got funnels and we do funnel stacking some buys a book and they're pushing the webinar and then from there
 You know we came through a whole a whole sequence to get people to ascend and move up right and a couple years ago
 I didn't at a fun-hacking lab
 I gave a presentation called funnel stacking and talked about the importance of it and why it's like, you know
 Tabbing just funnels not you know, you know, some people's business is like one funnel out so the whole business
 I'm like in the future. You got to become better at funnel stacking
 Which is like taking from funnel one to funnel two to funnel three and moving them up your your value ladder back
 Then it was like because you know, this is how you make more money, but it wasn't like a necessity, right?
 And you probably heard me say before my favorite den Kennedy quotes
 He said whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins, right?
 It's that's why funnels are so essential like when I got started back in day you guys heard a story, right?
 I sold a potato gun DVD
 That's why I sold and I was able to make money on that but then
 Google shifted and got more expensive and so we had to build out funnels to be able to still be profitable, right?
 And honestly for the most part I think most business owners over the last you know five or six years
 Have can have like a funnel and make money and you know be profitable because just the funnel metrics
 But something's happened over the last couple months and you may have heard of this
 Our friends over at Google and our friends over at Apple and our friends at Facebook
 all start hating each other and fighting and battling and because of these wars
 All of our tracking and our all sorts of stuff shifted, right?
 It changed and I'm sure not sure if you've noticed it
 We've noticed it but the cost-per-acpositions or cost to acquire customers gone up dramatically in most of the businesses and most of funnels
 We have because of these new updates and it's super annoying
 But guess what?
 For those of you guys who are listening to me who are funnel hackers who understand this stuff we've been talking about
 It is a slight annoyance that'll actually yield you more money than the day because you understand these principles
 Okay, so what's gonna happen is first off everybody who just had a funnel and that was their business
 It's gonna be harder for them to make money in that funnel
 They're gonna get closer and closer to break even or losing money in their funnel and a lot of people a lot of your competition a lot of people
 Round you are gonna be out of business. So there's number one like there's the the bad news
 A lot of people gonna be out of business the good news is most your competition is gonna get out of business
 Which means eventually ad costs probably gonna drop your ability to serve people is gonna be easier
 And so like those who stick through this are gonna win and it's gonna be better for you in the long term
 So that's the positive. Okay. This is the pattern that I've seen
 Year after year, you know decade after decade now. This is what happens and so
 Yeah, I told I warned you in the beginning of traffic secrets. I said there's a storm coming
 Okay, we're in the eye of the storm right now, right is happening and so ad costs are going up most businesses who are not
 Sophisticated who don't understand funnel hacking and these principles are gonna be gone
 But for you guys it's like now is the time to start preparing
 And so what that means is you like no longer is just your funnel breaking even like gonna be the thing that that
 Build you the right business right like that step number one like now you have to get into funnel stacking for some
 You guys it's not the first fun
 It's gonna be the second funnel breaks you even okay to hear that
 It's not the first is the second funnel the breaks you even or some might be the first second the third breaks you even after that you're profitable
 Right the biggest companies they go the deepest now for us who aren't VC backed like for example, I can hub spot
 It's hub spot. We're looking there their metrics and they go like a year or two years in the holes
 Like they'll spend two thousand dollars to get a trial customer and they don't make any money that person for two years
 But they can do that because they've got all these VCs backing them right
 People like me and you who are bootstrapping we don't have unlimited budgets right so we still have to break even quickly or we can't keep scaling
 So the goal always initially was like break even in your first funnel and then your second fun
 was all profit right
 But now it's gonna be going deeper because of just these new changes and how things are you know how things are playing out
 And so it's important for you to do funnel stacking where it's like hey
 This may be my book funnel and from that I push my webinar funnel in there
 So I take a funnel we're taking them through this sequence and and and maybe it's like in the middle of the webinar funnels
 We break even or maybe even at the end of the webinar funnel you're at break even or something
 But but you got to start figuring those metrics out start figuring that process out right?
 It's not something to think about one thing people ask was how do you track these things and
 Alex Becker accuracy is really good tool now called high rose
 HY ROS that we're using for our tracking and it's it's probably the best thing out there right now still not flawless
 known as flawless someday someday since we build a flawless system, but
 It's been super helpful for us to be able to see
 The tracking from funnel the funnel and kind of see what's happening with people
 But anyway, I want you guys to understand that like this funnel stacking is a key so for example
 That's why I'm so excited about today's webinar day
 Because recently we acquired a company and I'm gonna give more details probably funnel hacking live while first start talking about it
 but we acquired a company that has a whole bunch of front end funnels and
 We bought the funnels because they're they're so profitable
 Like the average cart value is like a hundred and I don't know top 130 hundred forty dollars
 So we spend a lot of money to acquire customer
 Which is why each of the funnels gets three to five hundred new buyers a day
 Which is awesome right and my goal long term is to get all those people in the click funnels like that's the whole business model right like
 These we bought this company because we're buying all their front end
 Funnels so we can push people in the click funnels in the back end
 Now in the middle of the acquisition is when these ios, you know facebook
 Apple updates started happening and our caught like the
 The cost to acquire customer went up and all of a sudden these funnels were you know 25% profit margin went down to a 0% profit margin
 And at first, you know, everyone's freaking out. We should cancel the deal. We shouldn't do it
 I'm like no, no, no, you understand like this is why we have to do the deal
 This is the key like like yes
 It sucks that like the margin is now gone from these funnels but the same thing is like we're still a break even or you know
 Maybe a little bit in the hole but we're acquiring all these customers and then we can put them into our second funnel and that's where it becomes profitable, right?
 So the question is well, what is the second funnel? What's that look like how does it gonna work?
 And so that's what i'm testing today
 So what i'm doing today is I'm doing a webinar to the entire buyer list entire customer list of this company we bought
 And if you have seven or almost eight thousand people registered so it's gonna be a big webinar day today
 Um and and hopefully i don't bomb it and it's a big payday, but who knows i could bomb
 So we do webinar and if webinar goes well, I take that webinar presentation and then we plug it into the back end of everyone these funnels
 So somebody buys the product they'll go through the funnel hit the thank you page. Thank you page
 We plug in the actual webinar get some on the webinar and now the funnel stack has been the first funnel stack has been completed
 And he gets somebody from buying the software
 give an thank you page watch the webinar buying click funnels and um and that again that becomes the first funnel stack
 And so that's kind of the that's the key that's the thing what you guys understanding is that
 Um, you know, I think a lot of people are like, oh, yeah, you're gonna make a ton of my other webinar
 I'm like not enough money to pay back what we bought this company for
 Right. I'm only doing the webinar to be able to create the second piece in this funnel
 The funnel stack thing is going to plug into the back of all these funnels
 So now all these customers coming every single day we can transition them from funnel one to funnel two
 Which gives us profit, but then also plugs people into click funnels, which is our continuity
 And that's the beginning of the funnel stack right and then there's things from there will take them on but that's the the key the principal concept
 Does that make sense you guys? I hope it does
 Um because that's the key I want you to understand the funnel stacking is the future
 Right. Just like we went from a single product to funnel was the last two decades
 The next decade is is moving from a funnel to a funnel stack
 Um
 And so that's the the key
 Um, if you want more info, I think I have a book I wrote back in the day called funnel stacking and I think I have it as an ebook now
 I might mess about a domain. I think if you'll funnel stacking secrets.com
 Uh, there's a free book there that shows you my funnel stack from book to webinar to high ticket
 And shows you the email sequences the numbers the breakdown
 Um and kind of a cool thing that you can use if you're trying to think through your your funnel stack
 But anyway, just want you guys getting that in your mindset now. We'll talk more and more about it
 Especially fun hacking live and other places, but the big key right now is
 Is as it was the products the funnels now are going from funnels to funnel stacking
 Um and those who can spend the most money to acquire customer win and those who can't are going to lose
 And so if you want to win this game, it's time to start learning these skills and become more advanced in your your marketing
 So hope to help stay shash for listening
 That said it's webinar day wish me luck and hopefully it's webinar day for you wherever you are listening to this
 If not schedule webinar gets people on it because webinar day is payday. It's the best day of the week
