 What's up everybody it's Russell Brunson and welcome to the market eating secrets podcasts damn and talk to you
 As about how I made over three million dollars in just 90 short minutes
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody so I'm
 Unless you're living under rock you've probably heard everybody talking about what happened last weekend which was kind of crazy
 So I had a chance to speak at Grant Cardone's 10x event and yes the rumors are true
 We did my presentation the end I sold a special offer and we sold over three million dollars
 in sales not just contracts but collected cash in the bank in just 90 short minutes and
 I've got a ton of questions coming in from all over the place
 But how we did it why we did it and all sorts of craziness
 So I just wanted to use this episode kind of tell you a little backstory and to show you the actual process how we did it
 And then at the end I've got 12 questions that a lot of you guys are asking as well
 That was kind of cover and so that's kind of game plan. So with that said
 I'll kind of jump back in the back story
 So a couple of years ago was the first time I ever heard about Grant Cardone when the guys it works for me
 Randy Grisel he
 He came to me to talk about Grant Cardone and Mike who's that?
 He's like he's this guy and he showed me some videos and was like oh so he came aware of him then started following him and just
 started seeing his stuff and
 Last year's probably a year and a half ago
 He he decided he was in the launch an event
 He called it the 10x growth con and he launched this event and I was not one of the speakers when they launched it
 And as they started launching it started getting bigger and bigger and finally one of my friends Brian post he reached out to me
 Said hey, you should really speak this event. It's gonna be a big deal on the mic
 I don't have time to speak at events anymore much that I'd love to and he's like this is one
 I think it'd be worth for you to do so he introduced me to somebody over there and
 Next we knew I was on the I was on the page as a one of the speakers and I had no Grant Cardone at the time
 He didn't know me fact made a call before the event to find out what I was gonna talk about and I kind of told him
 And he's like well I want you to
 I still remember he's like and I've had other people like internet guys try to sell stuff and you know
 They're not very good at it
 In fact when you go out there just go and tell them the price first and just talk about it and do people will buy and I was like
 You know you guys know my backstory I've been doing this for a long time for over a decade
 I've spoken on stages a lot
 I know the process and I was like well
 This is what I want to do and they're like no no like just do it our way into the work
 And I was like okay in my head
 I was like no I'm doing my way like I know it works
 But and you know I didn't want to like be weird on their first relationship or first call so I was like okay
 So when's that event? I think there was I can't remember how many people these are 2200 or 2800
 I don't remember the exact numbers. We got there and you know
 We showed up Dave they would have nice show up in a big box of order
 Boxable order forms and we asked them so okay when I speak tomorrow
 You know I need a couple sales tables and he I need staff to help man the tables and to close sales
 And they're like why would you do that like we don't have staff for you?
 And I was like this is how it works and they never any
 Respect from the time that ever see me close their sale
 And so I couldn't get them to even give me like literally a table to sell from and so I'm like okay
 Well, this is how we sell so luckily Alex and Layla Hermose
 Who are inner circle members and two comic Club winners and soon to be eight figure award winners
 They were in the audience as well and and I said hey can you guys help us to close sales and make sure where's the table
 I'm like there's no table here. So there's like three door exit door
 So Dave was at one door at the box of applications and I had a handful of pens
 We bought it staples 94 and so is Alex and Layla
 And so when I did my whole thing and I did my clothes and people started running to the sides to sign up and Dave's
 Alex Layla point order forms out of a box trying to sign up people and in a
 Short 30-minute window there. They were able to close just shy of a million dollars in sales
 I don't remember exactly what I know is it was almost a million
 But not quite in sales in this thing
 I remember telling them afterwards because I got off stage and Grant Cardone came up to me at first time
 We actually met in person. He was like I never seen something like that before like what he's like
 I never seen a table rush like that people were running to the side to buy your stuff
 I was like yeah, I kind of told you as that but nobody believed me and
 And anyway, and I was like that's you know, that's how the process works and
 And I remember afterwards
 He was like I want you to show me how to do that
 So if you watched some of the faces or some of the interviews he'd known with me afterwards
 It's you know always about that like I never seen somebody do that before like that was the coolest thing in the world and
 Anyway, so about a month or so later they called me on the phone and they're like hey
 We're thinking about doing another event this time
 We're gonna try to get about 9,000 people out of you want to speak at it and I was like well first off I
 Don't think that's possible in 9,000 people to event
 But you know last meant was so good. I think we could you know if you do it again
 I'm more willing to come see it cool. He's like you're gonna be our big money speaker and
 Put me on the thing and they started promoting this thing for like the next year and lo and behold despite like my skepticism
 They had 9,000 people in the room like it was crazy
 It was in Vegas in the Mandalay Bay and the huge arena that you know
 I know they do boxing matches there they do concerts there like it was crazy and
 And so they they filled it out so probably about a month and a half two months ago
 We did call from before the event that I kid says was happening
 You know we're gonna you know
 We I think they'd sold at 8500 tickets at the time like we're gonna have all 9,000 sold and I was like oh crap
 And so we started talking about to do the sales process and they're like okay
 What's gonna happen to ram an app on the phone?
 So you just get up and cover to buy in the app and that's how you'll do your table rush table rush
 I was like no that'll know that'll kill all the momentum and they're not how it works like no like please please do not
 List me on the app and they didn't all the other speakers were in the app with their price points
 They just click a button to buy my please don't put him in the app like the whole so close social psychology of selling happens
 People stand up and they're all running to go buy something like please don't take that away from you please
 So they agreed do not put me in the thing and then I was like okay
 We need tables like how's it gonna work like this arena? There's three levels bottom floor first floor second or third floor and
 and
 Then it's like this huge it's like a big basketball arena, right?
 And so it's like there's people that can go all around the whole thing and they're like how are you gonna do this?
 I don't know. Let's let's brainstorm this we spent the next couple weeks kind of brainstorm out this process
 and
 So you obviously I wanted to go and prepare but biggest problems like I can't speak run the back room sign up
 So I'm like run the back of the room unless you're on second or third four four four
 You know second floor
 Then you got to run up the stairs and run halfway on the hallway to the other you know and it's just oh so stressed out
 Like how are we gonna make this work?
 And so as I was planning this I was talking a lot of people and one really good idea that I
 Got from Brendan Bouchard. So he has no Brendan
 He told me he spoke at a big event like that one time and said what he did is he he said afterwards people
 I was like pictures with you which is true
 I was like stuck in the casinos and the elevators everywhere people trying to get pictures with me
 But he said what he did is he put up a picture booth right next to the sales table
 He said they were signs up today you get a picture with me
 So you can have it and they so it happened is it you know a bunch of people ran over to buy and they get in line
 So it happened took an hour so these pictures
 So everyone's seeing this big line of people and some more people coming over and coming over and says you just have Billy keep closing
 From social proof for like an hour or so afterwards. I was like that's a really cool idea
 So I decided to take that idea and a bunch of other ones and this is kind of how we choreographed it
 so
 The first thing you should know from set is from stage selling one of the biggest things you don't want people to do
 It's like when you're about to make your offers to hand out order forms people always do this and drives me crazy
 They each other pitch and they're like all right ever to hand out the order forms and every starts handing out the order forms
 Also, everyone's like looking at each other get the order forms of handing it they're reading the thing they shot folks
 You on the speaker when I stopped handing out order forms in my sales rate dramatically shot up
 So I have a rule that's like never hand out order forms ever make them go to the back of the room to get the order form
 That for it therefore creates the the table rush to the back the problem we had this way is
 First off if we wanted to handle order forms we couldn't because there's nine thousand seats. That's impossible second thing is
 Because there's like tables on like different levels and things like that like I just like
 It would have been a nightmare like even as I'll get you in a minute
 I it took about three hours to process just get people thought the order forms because it was so so many people
 So I was like we need to figure out a way to get order forms in their hands
 But without them knowing there's an order form because if they have an order form it's gonna kill the sales
 And so I was like how we can do this and also we had this idea for the sneak attack
 So let me show you what the sneak attack is those who are watching this live if you if you're hearing it
 You want to see go to marketing seekers comm and you can actually see the video this
 Let me explaining this right now if you listen to podcasts, I'll just kind of walk through with me
 So first thing is like, okay, what if we gave them all packets?
 This is this is the packet right here. I was like inside this packet
 We were gonna have two things number one is the order form because this is what they need to have to fill out
 And I'm gonna have as little details possible on the order form just enough
 They know what they're getting and then you know have the bill from the fill it out
 So this is the order form Michael once on everyone's chair
 But I don't want to see an order form and second thing is like most people are gonna have a pen right
 I've got nine thousand people potentially buying like there's no pen
 So like I need to sneak attack a pen and everyone's seat
 So the goal is to sneak attack this order form and this pen and everybody's seat without them knowing that there's an order form there
 That's why putting this really cool package. It looks awesome and then inside of it put a couple things number one
 We put in these really cool. I build funnel stickers when it goes on your laptop when it goes on your phone
 So they get these like here's a gift from Russell reciprocity right here's this really cool sticker
 And then number two we've given these cool pop sockets that go on the back of your phone say funnel hacker
 So I was able to do a couple things is one is I actually demoed how to use these during my presentation number two
 They put these on the phone now that now they're part of our community their funnel hackers
 So there's two gifts that were there and then I had a note sheets for my presentation
 So like you got the sheet here you can open it up and you can take notes what we're talking about
 So although these three things whole goal of these is to is to be so cool and exciting that people do not notice the fact that
 There's a sneaky little order form and a pen inside the envelope
 This is how we are Trojan horsing an order form in every single seat in the entire arena
 And then we had this the envelope and the back was a big huge sticker that said warning
 You're not open until Russell Brunson's presentation begins that was on the back of the sticker
 So that was the plan and we're gonna we started getting all printed like 9,000 and printed and put together
 But then the problem happened is that we found out that the seats for the event
 They don't lay flat they pop up when people aren't sitting on it
 So like we saw our envelopes when sit on their seats because they would pop up and they'd fall the ground
 It's like crap now. We got to figure out a way to make sure that these packets
 Actually stay on their desk and then we went and ordered 9,000
 These bags say click funnels on it and then we put the packet inside the bags then hung the bags on the chair
 So then the next question is like well, how do we get 9,000 these out to everybody?
 And so we had to figure out how to do this
 We ended up doing it the night before I spoke
 After the event was over we we I think we hired 10 or 15 different temp workers plus
 We had about 10 people from our team and they went out to every single chair and take the packet
 And set the envelope and hook it hunked it on a chair and talking about two and a half or three hours
 So that's the entire thing to blanket the entire audience
 With the Trojan horse order forms wrapped up with a bunch of cool gifts and things like that
 Okay, so that was the thing
 Then the way was gonna happen is that after somebody decided to buy they were going to run to if they were in the
 VIP there's a VIP room at the table if they were in the bottom floor
 There was there was two tables in the back of the bottom floor and they were in anywhere in the bowl around
 They'd go section 118 so some people would run the stairs and right there
 So let it run stairs and run clear around the whole thing and then what they would do is they would order
 It would take me or they would take the order form
 Right here. It filled the order form then take it from the art team and then some our team would then hand them
 This packet right here. So it's fun to build their secrets what they bought then they could open up this thing up
 and
 then a couple things inside of it they pull it out and
 Number one is here's the thing that shows them how to claim what they just purchased
 So it shows them how to go online what's gonna happen and how we're gonna text them their login and if they have any issues
 They're support issues
 Number two is there's a letter to their business partner the spouse explaining what they just bought so that they they get home
 They're not like why did you spend this money?
 And the number three was a golden ticket that's sitting here. I'm gonna get a picture with Russell
 So they were handed this packet back there's just a rip this open grab the goal and take it out
 And then run up to 118 stand in line to get pictures with me and on top of that
 We give some other cool bonuses we gave them the funnel hacker cookbook if they brought this to us
 And we also gave them the expert secrets doc on secrets audio book
 They could plug in the air and listen to on their on their right home. So those are the two things we had created
 To get them to buy
 So that was kind of the the game plan so went out there the second thing is that I was gonna do my presentation
 But the problem is that everybody at the year before had seen my presentation
 We'd signed up I think 450 almost 500 people the year before in
 1997 and then over the last 12 months Grant has been promoting that
 Presentation like crazy. So I think like half million people have seen that presentation through him and his audience
 We sold a lot of quick phones because of it. Thank you Grant. We love you
 But I was like I hang of the exact same presentation to the same audience who's pretty much already seen this thing
 But I need to give the same framework of the presentation because the framework is what sells quick funnels
 Which has been proven to sell click funnels and it couldn't make the same offer because because we were charging more for software charging
 $3,000 and then number two
 Not only charge of $3,000 we were trying
 Obviously I needed to create better off for someone ever who bought last year to buy again a bunch of other things
 And so that was some of the groundwork. So
 Why do we raise prices $3,000? Why?
 A bunch of reasons number one is my goal was when we first started is my goal is to make was to make three million dollars in
 An hour and a half and this is the reason why when you do an event like this 50 percent what yourselves goes to the person who's hosting the event
 You keep the other 50 percent and so my goal was to try to make I wanted I wanted to net a million dollars an hour
 That way if somebody ever asked me how much I charge an hour could they well it's a million dollars an hour
 So that was kind of my my selfish reason why I wanted that was my goal
 So I was like hey if 9,000 people if we can close one out of nine at 3,000 bucks piece
 I'd be three million dollars which means I netted a million dollars an hour for an hour and a half
 Which would be really really cool. So that was the goal going into it
 And so because of that I took my my framework my presentation and I retweeted it re-changed it as you you know
 But the the structure was still the same
 I customized it very specific to their audience clenode there. I know who their audience is now
 I know who but they're looking for it hides the businesses they have
 With their major concerns worse we crafted the presentation speak directly to them and they made the offer better
 We added a bunch more cool things. We had a funnel scripts for you
 We had traffic secrets a bunch of other cool things and so the presentation was similar to ones
 I've done in the past, but it was definitely upgraded
 For this event and so I got on stage
 Excuse me, it's crazy. We got there. I suppose speak the
 Grand was supposed to speak the second day and I was speak right after him
 We got there and grants voice was gone like grand can't speak she up right now. I'm like, oh, I'm not ready for this
 and so we had a kind of scramble get everything together and they introduced me I came on stage and did my presentation and
 and
 At the end of the presentation I sold and from that we had
 We had over three million dollars collected
 From the presentation and we're still I think we have another probably half million or so in and declines
 We're going through right now, but all said down somewhere between you know three and a half to four million dollars
 But for simplicity sake we made at least you know more than three million dollars and 90 minutes from you
 Which means I netted more than a million dollars an hour for an hour and a half of my time, which was amazing and
 It was it was cool. So that's kind of behind the scenes
 Some of the tricks and the things we did to make sure that that actually worked. I hope I'm sure I'm missing things. Oh
 Yeah, and so after I did my whole presentation we closed
 It was crazy like they took me in the they had security guards
 The security carrier took me back and people are running to all different eight different places right like I see people running to the
 To the VIP table. I saw people running to the back tables
 We were at the stairs and was weird because typically when I get a table rush
 Usually in a smaller room and you hear that they're hustle in the bustle and so it's really really loud a lot
 Times the fact I blew table rush to get sold out in the room during the table
 So I can't even finish my presentation. Where's this one because the the stadium was so big?
 I heard a lot of rustling but it didn't get loud
 It was kind of weird thing. I'm like I have no idea people are actually buying us kind of nervous
 So I ended later when I went off stage and then security guards took me the bathroom got me drinking
 They took me back up to where the picture booth was at and I got to the picture booth
 I walked through the door and look out there and I see this section had all these like
 Stansions, I think this is called the people we've back and forth and about five or six levels deeper always people as far
 Both directions as I could see and people told me later that the line literally wrapped around the entire arena
 I stood there and people come in take their hands take a picture next person next person next person and took like three and a half or four hours
 With the pictures over on thousand twelve hundred people whatever it was a picture after picture after picture like
 I remember my face being really sore when I got married on my wedding night
 This was like that but way worse way longer. I just the boom smile. It was crazy
 And it was awesome and we went back home or went back to the hotel that night went to the room and we had
 How eight and I people sitting there trying to process all the transactions fast they could
 Which is really cool as well?
 Just saying he's huge stacks the order forms and seeing our whole team go through and processing orders
 And they would happen is by the time it's done. We processed
 I think we had in the bank like 2.4 million
 But there was like like 800 plus thousand hours of failed credit card
 Payments and so next morning was sent email and we also texted every credit card failed pull and come back to the to the table
 So by the time I woke up in the morning I came down
 The booth the 10x booth was there and there was a line of people the four or five people deep like our
 Wrapping this through the sanctions like you know a big line of probably I don't know 50 to 60 people
 In line you're credit cards updated and then and then we text your grant and his team said hey, you know
 This was awesome. I'm like I think I could push people over the edge
 You know, this is a group full of sales people like they probably want to learn how to sell
 What if I did a special one-day event where I showed them how to sell with I just sold and if you give me 10 minutes
 I think I can close another who knows worth of people and so they agreed so let me get back on stage next day for
 10 minutes come up there and basically tell everyone hey, yeah
 We did $3 million in sales if you guys want to see what we did
 Everyone who already signed up congratulations you this for free and doing one-day workshop
 I'm gonna walk you through how we do our presentation and then folks who didn't
 Now's the time pushing over the edge. Sam right now go get signed up and you get this bonus as well and apparently we said we
 Got about another 250 $300,000 in sales came from that from this from the double close
 we're not claiming it the double close so it was a second close and the second day and it was really really cool and
 Yeah, I think anything else I want to share with you guys so we did that we did double close
 and
 It was it was amazing such a fun experience. So all right
 So with that said there's 12 questions that Julie story and pulled off of Facebook people were asking me like crazy
 I probably already answered some of these but I'm gonna go through it anyway
 And and then she's probably interested in a really cool blog post if you ever see a detailed detailed breakdown of this with
 Images and screenshots of all the cool stuff we talked about it'll also be posted on the marketing secrets blog over marketing secrets.com. All right, so here we go
 The title of these questions are the 10 questions everyone keeps asking about something $3 million in 90 minutes
 But it's actually 12 questions. So there we go. All right question number one. How long to take you to create your presentation
 Great question. So the framework that I used was the framework for my funnel hacks presentation
 Those who've been following me for the last three years
 I did started brand new slide deck over at a slide number one
 I went to create all new slides
 But I was taking a lot of sections from other presentations and kind of bleeding them in I started that Monday
 I worked on all day Monday all day Tuesday
 Let's see it's alright Monday Tuesday
 And then Wednesday I flew to go see Dean Graciosi. So when's that with him all day?
 And then we flew from from Boise Arizona spent all day there then from there we flew there to
 Back to our hotel in in Vegas. So I'm not I spent some time and then Thursday I spent
 Probably half a day. So probably total said and done probably three three full days on the presentation
 I'm finally doing it from scratch. We'll take a lot longer that obviously probably take me about a week and after two weeks
 There's three days kind of reworking it and re figuring the whole thing out and getting it all to work
 number two how to come up with such a great offer so
 A couple things first off
 You know, I've had my funnel hacks offer for a while
 So I kind of know what that is and I was trying to make it better
 I so what are the things we can add to make this offer even better than it already is if that's if that's possible
 And so that's kind of where we where we started at those like my battery or a camera here
 I'm using for this presentation is overheating. So I'm gonna pause this really quickly
 The battery cool down. I'll be back to answer question two through twelve here in a few seconds
 All right
 I'm back. Hopefully the camera won't over heat again, but during the break James thought it would be a good idea
 If I showed you guys a stack of the order forms
 If those are watching the video if you're listening to the podcast go to mark_insiegers.com to check out this video
 So here's a stack of all of the order forms that were successfully processed
 Each one of these counts as a three thousand dollar bill, so
 Yeah, that's that's a lot of three thousand dollar bill
 So yes, this works and as I'm starting this somebody
 Well, it wasn't one of the questions here
 But I saw as I was going to Facebook for I read quick record
 So I'm asking like where I made it my presentation from it's like you guys
 This is the perfect webinar script if you haven't read the expert secrets book yet literally
 It's I just use the script that's in the expert secrets book. Oh, I have a problem with secrets
 I just tell everybody all my secrets and so the presentation is literally word for word from the expert secrets book
 Same one that I've been using and trying to keep you all you guys to use as well. So there you go
 Alright back to the questions. So question number two how to come up with such a great offer
 So again, I just took our offer we've been using in the past and we try to 10x it
 The event name was 10x was like I kept saying like Grant told me a 10x the event how can make this better?
 So instead of giving like copyright and training I gave him final scripts instead of just getting like traffic workshop
 I gave them traffic secrets. I did a call. I did the webinar blueprint with Jason Flattle and
 Last week before the event and one thing he talked about was like when he tries to include bonuses
 He's like first off
 I tried to like get proof that the bonus is actually worth a lot and so the one of the bonuses was I gave people access to traffic secrets
 Which is John Reese's course on how to get traffic
 I bought the company from him licensed all the content from him and so it sent me saying hey get access to traffic secrets
 I literally showed here's all the wire transfers of all the money that I sent John Reese to buy traffic secrets
 I'm like so to give you this bonus it cost me almost a million dollars to give you this bonus and
 And people were just going crazy like dude you spend a million dollars and I got to give you
 You know $3,000 for that so makes it really big so example if you try to create a bonus like
 One thing Jason said really smart is like I go and hire someone who's awesome at this thing and I don't just
 He's like you usually I could get it for free because I can stead I go and I pay them and I'll like wire
 I'm $10,000 something so I can show you like I literally spent $10,000 for this interview and you guys get it for free
 It's part of this course. It just gives you like a proof element, but anyway that was kind of a cool thing
 But that's kind of how we made the offer so great
 It's software and if you look at all the way I structured my offers is like when you invest in the funnel hacks training today
 I mean you all this other stuff for free so
 Click funnels became free traffic secrets is free funnel scripts is free
 You know all the other things are all free free free free free free the only thing they're paying for is the actual training
 So that's kind of a cool way to structure it
 And then again, I had the bonus this way the funmaker cookbook and the audio book
 They got to leave with which people love leaving events with stuff that they can like show they actually invest in something so they get
 They got the book they got the mp3 player
 and
 then
 What else what else oh
 And then the picture something they can only get right there is like you get pictures me
 You can take that home that way you've got a picture you can use and I told people to put on a wall as a
 Reminder the commitment they made they're gonna 10 extra business the next 12 months
 So those are some of the things for the offer
 What are the things you'd write before the presentation is stay focused?
 So for me like I get I still get nervous even the smaller events
 Usually I'm a nervous man hour to before I got stage this one
 I was nervous like two and a half days before I got stage. I was having this nervous energy
 Which wears you out so part of I keep energy up
 So it's like eating really healthy is like you know making sure I'm trying to get sleep and I and trying to like just keep energy up
 In the morning when I'm getting ready
 I was like listen to music trying to you know get myself in state and then a lot a lot of me is like getting down there
 Like I had to go the night before and actually stand on the stage
 Like for some reason that calms my nerves and I see like this is what it's gonna look like and what the audience is gonna
 Look like that was a big part for me
 And then when I got down there was just like
 You know I pray a lot during these nervous times I'm praying a lot
 I'm gonna be able to serve the highest level
 I'm gonna be able to say the things are inspired people motivate people to actually change their life and
 Yes a lot of praying and then when it gets really close I jump around I'm trying to energy out
 Should I get prepared and ready and then they start calling your name and the next thing you know you step out there and
 As soon as for me is listening on the stage
 I see everybody then all the nerves just kind of crash and then it's like boom into state and then you just go
 Hope that helps
 Number four was the hardest thing about logistics of processing that many cells so quickly so I can't talk about that
 The fact nobody had pens there's no way to send people to order forms and so kind of what we do with those packets and the sneak attack
 The Trojan horse order forms and pens that was the biggest part to get to work and have enough people to take orders
 We literally had people there
 Over an hour long line just to be able to take people's money
 Which I felt bad for next three or four speakers because literally people out on the hallway either buying or they were watching this whole
 Circus that was happening out there this huge line. So it was pretty cool
 Under five how'd you prepare your team and your company for this event?
 It was a big a lot of preparation ahead of time. We had pre-meeting explaining the process when we got there
 We showed everyone okay. Here's the tables are happening. Here's you got to be doing here's you get this you got to return this and if the most part
 Worked really good. We had some temp workers there who didn't pay attention very well that kind of messed some things up
 But for the most part it ran really flawlessly was just good number six. How has it been since the event?
 It's been
 Been crazy. I was in Vegas from the day and a half afterwards processing orders and get stuff done
 And it was tough like man. I remember in the morning. I need to get some water. So there was there's a little
 Shop where you can buy stuff right next to the elevator
 So I jumped in the other there's came down went to buy some waters and I got stuck out there for 25 minutes taking pictures of people
 I'm and I'm in my jammy's my hair's all messed up. I'm tired. I'm like
 I just try get some water for my wife and I and someone came to me like
 Like you buy your own water in the only multi-millionaire. I know who buys their own water. I thought it's kind of funny
 That was kind of crazy and then I'm we needed to get B roll though. So pardon me like
 We made $3 million of presentation. I'm gonna make a lot more than three of me telling the story of this presentation
 And you'll see some stuff coming out over next few months
 Of how we're gonna keep keep this the momentum going
 But you know part of it's like telling the story like so we had I had three of my video guys there capturing stuff and one of them
 Dan Usher he
 He's making a promo promo video for the bonus. I gave people a fun like live event. So anyway, you guys will see that here in the near future
 But one of the things that that he wanted to see like I want an aerial shot of the event
 Because like you can't buy a quadcopter on mandolabay and so he went and rented a helicopter
 One of the helicopters. There's no doors on it
 And then we got to go in the helicopter and they harnesses the helicopter and then we flew at night
 Past mandolin Bay and I got a hang out of the helicopter looking back him as he's filming me
 For like a three second B roll shot that we're gonna use in the promotional video
 So we did a lot of fun stuff like that
 And then my we got to take my wife shopping to go get some clothes and myself shopping as well to go close for fun
 Lacking live somebody that which was kind of cool and then after that went to Michael Jackson
 Show which was really cool as well and it was a good time
 But a good time it was hard to walk into the halls afterwards
 Just getting bombarded by everyone wanted to take pictures
 It was just it's tough because like I want to give everyone the chance and I was like if you bought you got your picture
 So like that was your shot and anyway, it was just I feel so bad to tell people know and I tell a lot of people know and it's just it was tough
 But I was in the crazy fun watching on Facebook's there was talking about it
 Apparently traffic conversion events happening right now and I'm up there
 But my bunch of my team is there and they said that it's the talk of the whole event everybody's talking about it
 Which I've been getting texts and voxers and Facebook messengers people all over the place that are messaging about it
 So it's kind of fun to just that it was that big of a deal that people know about it
 I never said most one piece of advice you give someone about self-esteem or from a webinar
 Study this book. I spent a year in my life writing those books
 You know exactly what to say how to say it where to say it and then go watch all my webinars like
 Even if you're gonna buy myself watch to learn the process learn the energy level
 Like all those kind of things you need to be able to produce a webinar and to do it
 Yeah model model model model like
 You know one of my friends who's now got a career
 Writing webinars people he told me he's like I've watched your phone
 I'm so I'm at least a hundred times and I'm like people doing webinars and like I'm like if you watch my
 I'm sitting you like you kidding me like
 Do your homework anyway there you go
 See like how I pitch why pitch see my tonality my voice patterns by
 How do the stack and the clothes and how I create urgency and scarcity how I'm answering questions like all those things are keys to it
 So you can read in the book, but then go watch it to understand it
 Number eight why did you have people do manual orders instead of digital?
 Okay
 Again everyone else who sold the event had people pull out their phones and click on the app to buy the product
 Couple things are one when we were in the venue the app had no internet access people who were doing that
 The sales actually didn't go through so a lot of their speakers were like okay
 Well when you leave the event go and find it number two is half of selling is like the social pressure and the psychology behind like
 Social proof. This is actually real. So it's like people point that by nobody knows who else is buying
 People are running up and they're running someone they see a line that wraps around the arena
 They see it all this energy excitement and momentum that I don't know what the exact that is but like everyone else
 Gets it so it must be something I need to be part of as well
 So causes a social situation to you as well. So that's why we did the old school way
 One said what was the incentive for them to wait in that along the line during the table rush
 It was to be able to come get a picture with me, which may seem like a dumb little thing, but
 It's important to people like I just know that every time I walk through the hallway before and after
 I was getting mugged by people who wanted their picture with me, which is funny for my wife
 She's like why do people want their picture with you?
 I'm like I have no idea. It doesn't make sense to me either, but
 That was a big thing that people people want that and it gives them something tangible
 So that was a big part of plus when they sat online they got the physical fun lack of cookbook and the mp3 player
 So just gives them some tangible as well and we give really people to meet you
 Someone buys me invest from you. They want to meet you and they want to shake your hand and have a picture with you
 Means of the world to them
 Number 10 you feel different now that you've broken another huge record
 Honestly, no I feel exactly the same
 My goal now is just not to let my head get too big
 But definitely to leverage it to grow click funnels even further
 So I guess that earlier like three three million dollars 90 minutes is cool
 But the thirty million dollars were generating a next 12 months because of this because the story is more important
 And that's what's gonna happen next and that's what most people give up most people do the first thing and then they stop
 We the first thing and then you will watch watch over the next three or four months is that how I leverage this
 You will definitely see it a number 11 is drink card. I'm getting kickbacks since it was his event
 Yes, you split the proceeds of yourselves 50/50 with the event promoter
 They don't want you to know how we work to get the to get the people in the room
 So they get half of the profits and it's totally totally totally worth it number 12 is anything you do differently
 Maybe but I don't know yet
 You know, I think I think overall we executed pretty well
 We thought a lot through it and it worked really really well
 I think my my double close my second presentation
 I probably would have choreographed that one a little better maybe get some slides and some things
 I just kind of let their inch kind of talk
 so probably did choreographed that a little bit differently, but for the most part really really happy with how it all went and
 Yeah, so there you go guys
 That was what happened at 10x events
 I made a million dollars in 90 minutes
 Which tons of fun looking out in the near future as I tell this story more and I'm kind of walking you through the details
 We'll have an offer coming out. It's gonna share all the information from behind the scenes
 Going through slide by slide minute by minute my presentation that'll all be coming soon
