 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing secrets podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everyone hope you're amazing
 I said a really quick message I want to share with you yesterday in fact, this is not even my message. I'm gonna give you the back story
 So that kind of set it up. So last night I got home from the office had a great day a lot of work
 I got home some my my beautiful wife my five amazing kids
 And we had a good time for like an hour and then the dreaded nighttime routine begins where we got to get them into bed
 And I don't know about you
 But for us it's a nightmare plus we got a lot of our kids are sick. They got coughs and like it's just it's kind of
 no way it just adds to that stress and so
 This hour-long process starts and it was hard way harder than most nights for some reason
 Like we started like we tried to read scriptures every night
 So and this time should have been the easiest because it was like we try to be one chapter each night
 There's only six verses in this chapter. So it's like we each read one. That's it. It's gonna be so easy
 No, it was a nightmare and then
 my son was one of my daughters
 Jami pants and she was mad and he was mad so that she was off crying
 So I try to like get her a sub crime by getting the pants back to him
 And then he is all mad and throws him and he starts crying and it was just like and the nor is coughing
 hysterically on then Aidan's having a coffee tax of the clay starts getting aid on the back to like help get the coughs out
 Nor thinks that bullets beating up a so she starts screaming bloody murder thinking that it's like jalte abuse
 So much so she starts like coughing and puking yourself because
 Finally I get the kids in bed get the person
 Yeah, it's just like your chaos
 Nor I
 See if we get
 The diamond watch so she's got it her in there and finally nor passes out I go into watch
 Something else in the room because I think separation like
 I
 Video that Ryan ran posted
 And man, it was awesome. I watched it and it was like
 exactly what I needed for last night and
 after I watched I sat there
 Just grateful and thankful and I looked at this moment that
 That just minutes earlier had been a horrible miserable moment to
 Something it became super grateful for so I just messes morning saying hey man
 Can I please post that video on my podcast that we're else can hear it because I think it's important and
 Special and cool and he said yes, so with no further ado. I'm gonna queue up the video
 Thanks everyone. Hope you enjoyed this episode MC as a mom when I was a kid
 All I wanted to be was a millionaire
 Now that I am a millionaire
 All I want is to be a carefree kid
 There was a time of my life where I lost a lot of weight and I had abs for the first time in my life
 But I felt too skinny and all I wanted was to add some muscle now that I've added some muscle
 All I think about is how much I miss my abs
 Before I was a father all I wanted was kids I
 Wouldn't trade my daughter for anything, but I sometimes missed the days when I was alone
 When she was a baby and she was crying in the middle of the night all I wanted was for her to be older
 Now that she's older we have such a stronger connection, but sometimes I
 Missed the days when she was a baby when I was
 Growing a small business
 All I thought about was growing a big business
 Now that I'm growing a big business a successful business
 I sometimes miss the days when it was small or simpler
 growing up
 In a small town near Cleveland, Ohio
 All I thought about was getting out now that I live in a big booming city I
 Miss home I
 Realize the other day that there are two sides to everything
 There are the problems that we feel in the moment and there are the positives that we think about in the rearview mirror
 We feel the problems and we long for the positives
 We rarely if ever pause to appreciate the positives while we're still in them and instead
 We just experienced them later and we experienced them in the sense of
 missing the times that used to be a
 Friend of mine lost her brother recently and my heart just broke for her because I knew
 That all she thought about all she wanted
 Was to have her baby brother back and I knew that she thought that if she had her baby brother back that she would
 Appreciate him so much more and
 Love him so much harder than she ever had now
 I have a brother and I don't spend 24 hours a day
 Thinking about how much I love and appreciate my brother, but if anything ever happened to him
 All I would think about was
 Having my brother back
 It made me realize that there are things in my life that I overlook that if they were taken away from me
 It would be the thing that I longed for the most the times when my daughter is screaming
 If anything ever happened to her all I would want would be to comfort a screaming baby if my business went under and
 I was working for someone else. I would long for
 The grind of starting something new spending long hours building something if I was going hungry
 The extra flab covering up my abs I would gladly trade my hunger
 For a little bit of fat if I had food to eat the beautiful curse
 About being human is that we are wired to find problems that does not make us happy
 It actually makes us miserable
 But it also makes us grow and create and to solve those problems
 We rarely if ever pause to appreciate the things that are in our life that we could be grateful for
 Until it is too late, but you get to control what you focus on
 You get to control
 whether you
 consciously appreciate the things that are in your life or if you focus on the problems and you wait until later when you feel
 That sense of longing for how things used to be no matter who you are
 Where you are what you have or don't have I can promise you there is someone else
 looking at your life longing
 To be in your situation even in the situation that right now you see as a problem
 There is someone who looks at your life and longs to be in that situation even though
 Once they got it they would probably long for something else
 No matter who you are or where you are you have so much to be thankful for and to appreciate
 these are
 the good old days
