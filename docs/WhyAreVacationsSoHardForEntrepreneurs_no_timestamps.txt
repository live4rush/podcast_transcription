 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing seekers podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets

 Hey everyone
 Hope you're excited for today. I've got this weird thing. I think a lot of entrepreneurs suffer from this. Maybe it's just me
 But it's damn one vacation
 For a week. I'm actually like looking forward to it, but at the same time
 it really stresses me out and
 I it's one of those things like it's funny because everybody always tells me rustling you on the vacation
 You're gonna burn out if you keep doing the stuff you're doing the pace you're doing all sorts of stuff
 But it's weird because like when I'm
 Sorry trying to
 Do it the new camera tripod while I'm driving
 Anyway, it's weird though because like when I'm at the office and working and being like doing my my thing
 Like I never feel stressed everyone's like I stress you overwhelmed like not really like I feel like I'm I'm kind of like
 In my in my flow my motion whatever you want to call right, but then I go on vacation. I get like super stressed and anxiety and like
 Sitting there and not doing stuff like it's really
 really hard for me
 That's why I like reading on vacations at least I feel like I'm like
 Something's progressing and it's interesting. Um at the Pirates Cove mastermind with Alex Sharfen
 Come and helping him to kind of figure out how to monetize his entrepreneurial personality type
 Content which I'm excited for because it's funny because I told him
 I first sure to speak by two or three years ago on the entrepreneur personality type and it was amazing
 Like I felt like I connected with him everything that I was like okay now
 When I hear something like that I want to give somebody money for something and I was like there's no way for me to give him money
 So this is funny actually I asked him if I could buy the point the entrepreneur personality type from him and he's like
 No, and he's like why am I like I don't know exactly what I do if I had that I can make a crap ton of money with it
 He's like alright, so they join the coaching program right afterwards
 So I can help him do it. It's like it's kind of fun. We're helping him go through the process now
 He's gonna kill it and it's exciting
 But one thing he talked about those interesting about entrepreneurs
 I mean if you have a study at Alex's stuff like it's worth it and it'll be soon in a format
 It's gonna be a podcast. It's gonna be training programs with a bunch of stuff that
 He's kind of going through the little experts secrets process now to figure out how to take in something
 And I'm excited when it's done
 I'll be the first customer and I think that all of you all because you're all like me should as well
 But it's the entrepreneur personality type and he's talking about like the different traits of entrepreneurs and one thing that
 It's kind of weird
 I think I've heard him give the presentation three times his core kind of main presentation and all three times
 He's this one party talks about how like entrepreneurs don't
 Identify with happy or sad and I was like whatever I'd identify with that and then like the more he started
 The more
 Like he started talking about the more I was thinking I'm like
 What am I happy or sad? I was like people I said look happy, but I'm like I'm just kind of happy person. It's funny. I am
 I
 This is probably more personal than you just want to know but I went and got my testosterone taken
 Actually three years ago. I'm launching clickfunnels
 I came back like 160 which the doctor literally told me it's like your grandma's got higher testosterone than you do right now
 I'm like well, and then like
 Six eight months later did again. I was like 350 and I got done this week
 I was like I was like 450 but every time I got it done
 The doctors have always told me they're like how are you standing here? You should have no energy no motivation
 and I was like no, it's like the opposite like I
 I
 So much motivation so much energy he's asked me I was like he's like do you feel tired of my like well
 I was like tired like sometimes he's like do you feel
 Like did you do you have bad like bad memory Mike no is like do you feel a depress me?
 No, he's like do you feel like all these things and
 The end of it he was like he's like so why are you here? I'm like cuz my testosterone really loves it
 You have no symptoms of it
 I was like just because like everything's so exciting right now and I started thinking more else with Alex stuff
 Like the entrepreneurs don't relate with happy you're sad
 And I was kind of thinking I'm like there's sadness obviously and someone dies or things like that
 But like as a whole you get in the morning. It's not like I'm a happier my sad
 And so he's telling I was kind of confused and I was like I wonder how most people view happy and sad
 Like it didn't really make sense to me and then this next slide next portion
 He said he said a word and like for me. I heard I like I got chills. I was like
 Whoa, that's what I do and he said entrepreneurs don't feel happy or sad what they feel is either
 Momentum or a lack of momentum like they're moving towards something or they're not they're moving away from something
 And like that's what we relate to like like when like what we relate happiness to is like motion forward and we'll relate
 Sadness to wherever is is like not progressing not moving forward and
 I think it's just I think it's just fascinating like momentum movement like that's what what drives
 entrepreneurs like that's
 This is not a happier status. It's movement momentum and
 I think about today as I'm going to vacation like it's funny cuz I'm leaving today
 So like I was up all eight last night about early this morning
 I'm trying to get stuff done because I'm
 And like I almost like enjoy the process of right before vacation. Okay, so much stuff done
 So I'm like freaking out like I gotta leave this time. So I'm running running running and moving momentum
 And then like you want vacations like you stop like everyone wants to just like chill out
 They want to sit and they want to just like sit at the beach like I don't know what it is like I get I
 Sitting in a beach
 Does do anything for me
 Yeah, it's just weird so like for me it's like I have to have momentum in this
 In this experience is vacation or else I'm gonna drive the rest of my family and friends and everyone is with us nuts
 And they probably even know they're just like why is Russell twitching over the sides like cuz I need momentum
 I need something it's like that's all sneak away and already you know
 I'm sitting there like they're all talking and I'm like thinking about something like my gosh I can do this
 I'm creating one sitting there thinking cuz I'm like nervous and it's just funny cuz my wife was big
 You know the case you know that talk about business. I'm like I
 Don't talk about business than like everything halts and stops progressing in my life and like lack of moment momentum
 lack of movement lack of like direction is what will make me depressed and and and sad and like capital stuck and
 So anyway, it's a funny it's a funny line that we have to deal with especially all your entrepreneurs who are out there because
 Like we just see the world a little differently and I think a lot people think we're freaks because of it
 There's nothing bad with it. I don't think there's anything bad like it's you know
 It's like why businesses are created why there's momentum in the world I think it's because entrepreneurs who
 Dry the entire sole drive is momentum towards moving like like we have to have that so
 While we go on vacation because we love our wives and our kids and our family members like it's probably the hardest most stressful part
 Which is so weird because it's like go relax go take some time you're gonna burn out and it's a little different
 So anyway, so I'm excited
 I've been plotting I have three vacations this summer been plotting all of them like what books to read which order what course them to study like
 Like what things I'm gonna be moving like it's just funny how like that's been the most exciting thing for me is like planning what I'm gonna do when
 When I'm not doing anything
 Anyway, there you go. That's a entrepreneur
 So if you're an entrepreneur and you don't really have your savvy you do relate with momentum and movement and you stress out about vacations and
 That's what I'm at and I relate with you so
 Nothing else on your family vacations is someone when you're stressed now because you do nothing I get you so while that's happening think
 ponder vision
 You know dream like that's that's what at least for me keeps me going and lets me
 Function like a normal human being with everybody else so
 Anyway, that's all I got you guys have an easy day have a good vacation if you're going on one too, and I'll talk to you soon. Bye
