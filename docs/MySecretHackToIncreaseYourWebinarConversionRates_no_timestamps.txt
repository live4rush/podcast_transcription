 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast. I'm at the office late night
 Just did something cool. I want to share with you because something you should be doing inside of your webinars
 Your presentations and your funnels as well
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome the marketing seekers
 All right, so some of you I saw the webinar fuel webinar the Anthony
 Morrison and I did really recently in fact we stood tonight for the time
 I'm you're listening but or time I'm recording this but it could be a week or so by the time you listen to this this episode
 But basically after we came in here and we did the webinar so
 It was a little like ready fire anything sounds like if we plan this to be in a month now
 It's gonna take us a whole month to get launched and we said you know let's get done quick
 So we gave ourselves like three days so what that meant is like day number one which was Monday
 Create registration page and promoted it right day number two then I created the slides as quick as I could
 Which weren't perfect, but they were kind of good
 And then day three I finished slides and then we went live and it was just chaos because we had over ten thousand people registered
 We had like I think
 35
 Hundred live. I don't know it's kind of it was chaos. It was a lot of fun though
 And then we did the webinar and overall the webinar was awesome
 It crushed its cells converted really well like everything was was awesome with it
 But there are three or four spots that I could tell didn't work quite right that we missed something
 Looking back at the questions that people submit afterwards like oh they're like they're missing this gap and then and there wasn't the urgency
 And scarcity wasn't right and a bunch of things were missing in fact it's kind of fun Todd
 You know like co co-founder partner Todd he watched it and then he messaged me's like Russell
 You messed up you forgot about this and this and this and I was like how's Todd teaching me webinars now?
 But it was actually really good
 It was some of the most the key things that we did inside of click funnels to increase conversions on our webinars
 And I totally forgot about it
 as I was rushing to build these slides out and so basically what it was was
 Was that again? There was no there's no urgency and scarcity a couple things
 If you've ever gone through any my my deep webinar trainings that talk about how in the offer stack you want to introduce
 Constraints so that later in the stack you can you can unlock those restraints, right?
 So what I so what the thought was instead of saying hey you get webinar fuel
 I'm limited everything was coming and saying hey you get um, you know, you webinar fuel and it's gonna be limited
 We get 20 20 webinars you can build hundred thousand things like that
 And so there's constraints which people like knowing about constraints
 But they're okay because it's still pretty good and then at the end of it like the bonus against people act now
 It's saying hey those who get started today while we're live we're gonna release these constraints instead of having 20 webinars
 You get a hundred or I'm unlimited said this you're gonna get this you don't kind of un you kind of break those things out
 And so it's cool about that is
 He told me I stuff like oh my gosh
 She's right and right now we were Brandon Fisher on our team is that like rendering out the webinar and getting it ready
 All sorts of stuff like that. I was like wait before you render the final version. I need to record some clips
 I ran back to the office
 You know, it's nighttime now where it was the morning or during the day
 We do the webinar so I like turn lights try to make it look as close to possible
 You know what look like before I came back and I redid three sections of the slides to introduce constraints and then and then unleash those
 Restrains by making the unlimited offer and and we record those three things quarter part one part two part three
 Brands going through and editing it in and then and the end idea for a way to increase it with your bonus
 So he's recording that right now and then brand will edit that in but it's taking this presentation
 They did really really well and it's like what are the holes where the gaps will can do better and recording those things and weaving them in and it's really
 It's really powerful to think about it. Can you imagine like
 Do you like you remember this is probably a horrible example, but it's top by hand and probably tired right now
 So but on Seinfeld where it's the time where George is with his buddies and they're there
 They're making fun of him. They keep ripping on him and and he has come back
 He's always the way way to storms come backs and it doesn't work
 And so finally he had he comes up with the perfect comeback and he's so excited and they come back with something like
 The jerk store called and they're out of you and everyone's like trying to give like that's a horrible comeback
 You better come back and and then he's trying to put himself in situations where he can use his comeback
 He's been waiting forks. It's like this is the perfect comeback
 It's gonna crush everybody and like just destroy him and and he kept setting up finally like they came back and someone said
 You know the the thing he's like the jerk store called and they're out of you and it kind of bomb
 But it was funny because yeah, he knew that like oh this was blind if I had this line it would work perfectly
 I think for for us like the reminder it can spin a while since I've done something like this
 But it's like the webinar overall was good
 But like a couple parts like ah if I just would said this it just had this piece it would have been perfect
 And I forgot about it and so on what this gives me the ability and I'm telling this because you guys do as well
 Is that the recording that's like it's done?
 It's good, but now I know where the holes are I'm going back and recording him and trying to record it with the same energy
 Level trying to record it in the same situations close as I can so that our video editors can weave it into the presentation
 And hopefully people won't notice and if they do notice it's such a small thing that's not going to stop them
 But it adds in these things that change everything
 Okay, and those days we've heard my story about how we launched click fun
 This is exactly what we did stuff we didn't edit it in a live video put into the video this happened live
 Going doing webinars every single
 Honestly three or four times a week for it for a year where I do a webinar and I'd go back to the questions when webinars
 I'd look at every word and say okay people ask questions about this and about this and about this so I knew what the concerns were
 I'd go back to the slides and edit the slides add things and try to resolve the concerns before they came up
 I had making these more simple and then my presentation got better
 And then the next time I did the presentation export the questions found the holes read read you know
 Tweet the presentation came back and did it again and did it again did again to the point where you know a hundred times later
 The presentation was perfect like I knew every objection
 I was able to crush it before the objections even showed up
 I knew everything was holding back from buying all the pieces I knew and so that's kind of um
 That's kind of what we did and so I'm sharing that because
 For all of you guys just start thinking through that with your presentations like your presentation is good going back looking at
 What's the holes like especially if you do an automated webinar, you know what like what things can I add to this presentation?
 What can I tweak what can I change how can I increase scarcity?
 How can I increase the offer I can make it better and edit those things in the tweak and keep adding them to try to make your
 presentation convert better so
 Anyway, just a thought that I think you know
 I said it tonight and it's funny because you know there was a time six years ago when you're launching click phones for my
 I was neck deep in the stuff
 I was doing so many webinars all the time
 I you know I was in it and because I've you know been
 CEOing and the things that I've been doing lately
 I haven't had a chance to really get deep in
 Presentations and for me it was kind of fun because I didn't do slides fast
 I left a lot of gaps a lot of holes and it forced me to like just do it and turn out good
 But now I have a chance to come back and make it great and make those changes in those tweaks
 And so I just want to show out with you guys because I think a lot of times we launched something and it doesn't work
 We're scared or whatever and it's like you gotta be okay with that
 like it's you just gonna make the tweaks and the changes and then come back and do it again and do it again so
 We hope hope help somebody I just want to share with you real quick tonight
 I'm gonna get back to editing the rest of this presentation get live
 Because replace it tomorrow and now this new version is gonna be even better than the live version was today
