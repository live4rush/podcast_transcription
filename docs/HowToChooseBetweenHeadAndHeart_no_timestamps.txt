 Hey everybody, this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing security podcast. I'm back with some more Q&As from the ecom experts
 Smackdown the Allison and Princeton I did last week and this next question was a really fun one
 The question they asked was as they're pursuing their business like how do they choose between their head and their heart?
 This person asked a question their heart had an idea and a passionate thing
 They wanted to do but they didn't know if they saw the clear path like how is it make money and how it's gonna do all these things
 Versus their heads like oh, there's other ways I can do this at a very you know numbers based and like you know
 I can make money faster on those things and like the question was how do I how do I choose between my head and my heart?
 And so I think something a lot of us struggle with because all of us have these missions right
 We're called on this mission
 Then part of it's like I gotta make a bunch of money and like the yin yang between that
 How do you figure out what do you do and like which one do you follow?
 Do you follow your head or your heart?
 And so I think that this question was very relevant and timely for most of us and hopefully for you and
 And hopefully my answers and I will ask and I give back will be useful for you as well
 So that said we're gonna queue up the theme song we give back you have a chance to answer this question
 How do you choose between your head and your heart?
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 This is from John he says how do I choose between my head and my heart?
 My heart tells me that I should pursue one direction vision and path and this feels like my calling from God to empowerment in
 particular husbands to overcome destructive addictive
 behaviors, but my head says that I should pick a more practical direction a product or some other safe bet
 How do I go all in and follow my heart when self doubt and fear are so strong?
 People look at my business today and they're like oh Russell you pick such a good market you pick funnels and like of course
 That's the big thing. This is amazing, but I want to rewind back 18 years ago
 18 years ago. I started learning about this and I was like this is the greatest thing in the world
 I start telling everybody told my mom about my friends about my family about and they're like oh
 He's crazy right and that's like none of my friends were on about this
 I got told about so I Brent was here for this. I literally bought radio ads in Boise
 I know saying I'm doing an event talking about marketing and self-s
 And the first the first event is supposed to have I don't know 50 60 people that had RSVP from the radio at two people walked in
 I was like oh crap, and I'm like well which man mayor to say me else comes in and then no one came in I'm like well
 All right, and so I did a presentation of two people talking about funnels
 And then the next like two hours later the next group was coming like one person came in next group like three people came in
 So that day I was expecting he said a bunch of people up funnels, but nobody cared
 And but I guess what I didn't care because I loved it. I was obsessed with I was passionate about so I talked about
 I talked about it talked about even though nobody was there and I did another event
 Guess what nobody showed up
 I did another very few people show up
 I did another one and another one and another one and I did it because I care about the topic because I'm obsessed with it
 I did it because I loved it
 I would have done it even if nobody ever showed up now guess what because I love about it so much
 I kept doing it kept doing it
 This is the hard stuff and kept doing it and kept doing it and kept doing it eventually
 Other people started getting excited other people started seeing the vision other people started showing up
 And now 15 18 years later you got a fun hacking live and there's 6,000 crazy people in the stands who all obsessed with funnels like
 Oh Russell your genius you picked the greatest market ever know I picked a market that was not there
 But I was obsessed about it and I cared about it
 And so for you what's his name John?
 Yeah, if you're excited give you're passionate about that like like don't like if you're going to say what's gonna make me
 Those most money the fastest like don't go to that way looking like what do I actually care about?
 Funnels are not making me the most money the fastest by any stretch, right?
 But it was my art is what I cared about so what I wanted to do all day like I just wanted to like
 Like all I want to do is talk about funnels and like I couldn't like there was no market nobody cared about it
 I kept talking and kept talking and tell people cared about it
 And that's what we have to do like especially on the experts side like like if you're excited by it
 This is your art
 This is how you're called to change the world like your people might not be ready for you
 But you might not be ready either
 Like if most years came to my event 18 years ago in the holiday and boy is the Idaho with the two other people
 I'm like that guy has nobody was talking about right because I don't understand my framer sign how to talk
 I was awkward. I was nervous. I was like all the things like I wasn't read either
 But I would never become ready if I didn't start and I kept talking about talking about so like that's the heart stuff
 Like if you love this this is your art. This is your passion. This is your mission
 Like you've got to go out there and start doing it start talking today
 That's why I always tell people like like if you want to do this start publishing somewhere
 It's gonna be a blog or a podcast or video just doing something because a couple things happen number one
 You're gonna feel awkward when you first start because you're like oh nobody's even listening and the good news is that at the very beginning
 You're probably gonna suck and so it's a good news that nobody's listening
 Okay, but if you keep doing it consistently eventually you're actually gonna get good
 Right and the longer you do it the longer your dream clients the people you've been called to serve will have to actually find you in traffic secrets
 I'll probably mess up the quote
 But Nathan Barry wrote a blog post and I quoted it in the traffic secrets book
 But it's called it had endure long enough to get noticed and the blog post he talked about how most of us
 There's so much content right between Netflix and Disney flag all the shows like there's so much content happening
 The most of us don't like jump on the new show
 We wait for season one season two season three and if after season three or four like people are still talking about it
 Then we're like okay
 I'm gonna go dive into this thing because it's endured long enough to get noticed and the biggest thing is true for us as well
 Like at first no one's gonna pay attention
 But you keep doing it keep doing it
 And if you are willing to out survive it because you're so passionate about your art
 Right and you keep doing you keep doing it and you endure long enough than your people have a chance to find you
 Okay, so that's the key is just like like don't do the practical thing like oh, I'm gonna go get
 Doctors degree and whatever like do the heart thing
 But don't do because I'm trying to start a business right now
 Do it because you're actually called because you love the people because you want to change their lives
 And if you keep doing it and you're passionate keep talking about it eventually they'll come
 Double down do you think you are passion helped you to get through the hard days to help you to keep showing up versus
 Let's say you are an accountant
 You're like I gotta show up again. Do you think it's showing up from your heart first thing versus your head helps you to get through the harder times
 100% your head
 Yeah
 Because for me again like it wasn't I think you're the same way like whether you made money on this or not
 Like you're here to serve people and you because you love this you change your life
 You want to change it like that's the biggest thing is like the heart is like it doesn't matter if it succeeds or it
 Fails some days we have big sales days since we have no sales days
 But it's like we keep showing up because it's like this is my calling
 This is something that I believe and I'm so passionate about like even if somebody doesn't buy something
 But they hear something it gives them that shift like that that means the world to me
 And so yeah, but if it was if it's in your head like maybe you make more money in the short term
 But in the long term like the legacy for those who are VIPs
 I talked I did a private session you guys yesterday morning talking about our super bowl goals things like that
 Like you want to hit like what is your hall of fame goal?
 Like it's gonna be hard to hit it up here. It's gonna be coming from here
