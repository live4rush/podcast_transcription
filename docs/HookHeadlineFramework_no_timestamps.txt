 Hey, this is Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing secrets podcast
 We're excited to have you guys here today
 Hey before we get started make sure that you go to iTunes if your listeners podcast rate review like us
 Let us know what you think that means a lot to me
 I'll read the comments and it helps me to know what you want and want to give you more and today
 We were talking about the framework behind the new conversation nomination presentation
 I'm gonna show you what we did how we did how we made it sexy and a whole bunch more
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everyone, this is Russell and so excited to be here today. So
 We are less than two weeks away from fun hiking live going live, which is crazy and
 All sorts of crazyness is happening, but to start it off course. I don't like doing anything normal
 I want as much pressure as possible because for some reason when a lot of things are happening
 I'm able to focus and get stuff done. So we decided this week to do a keto
 Fast reboot diet and I tricked about nine other people besides me into doing it
 Because prove it just came out with their new like keto reboot kids
 I want to try it out ask if I help write some some stuff for them and help on a funnel and stuff
 So I was like well let me try it out
 So they shipped us out a bunch of reboot kids so for the last 60 hours
 60 hour fast basically and all you usually have these are in keto products. It's like you have a keto
 Drink in the morning and then you got a keto bone broth
 Which was shockingly good and then another keto drink and these little pills and then this like keto tea at night
 Which was good to like anyway, so you do that for 60 hours and so we just broke our 60 hour fast
 And just had bacon eggs and avocado my three favorite foods all in one super meal, which is awesome
 So now I'm heading into the office to work on my slides and presentations and stuff like that
 but
 I wanted to share something with you guys today because maybe it'll give you a little hope or faith or
 Knowledge or I don't know whatever it is you need to to get through what is you're doing, but
 So I've got six presentations. I'm giving fun. I give you five
 And I just started on them basically on Monday
 So I got a two-week window to get them all done and you may be like oh, that's easy six presentations two weeks
 But each presentation for me is usually between 150 and 300 slides
 So these aren't micro these are macro big big big projects
 I'm trying to get done up for me if like five to an appliance for last six months never got done
 So for me, it's all about like just in time like getting things done just in time
 So now it's like okay, it's go time like I have to I have to get these done
 I know their option like now is the time start creating them and
 And so I just want to share the process because maybe that helps on you guys so
 It's in 48 hours and then 48 hours all I have done is for my presentation number one. I have a
 title the title slide a headline and a doodle graph of the
 What's the word I'm looking for of the process I'm gonna be teaching on the process is not the word of
 The the system they get there's a word all come to me
 But basically like this is what I'm teaching in a doodle in a whiteboard thing
 And that's why I got on 48 hours and people are like you never get these slides done at time Russell
 You said at 48 hours on that is true, but like the slides take a lot of like grunt work
 But not a lot of thinking right just kind of okay
 What image can I put in here to like remember my brain to talk about this concept and what's the headline?
 What's the they just things that that pull you through the presentation the bigger part is the structure like what's the structure?
 Of what you're gonna be you're gonna be teaching people right and then what's the hook and then how do you make it sexy?
 so for me it's like it's like
 Yeah, maybe that's maybe that's the thing. It's like the structure of the hook and and try to in and
 And try to be sexy. So the structure was the biggest thing
 So I was trying to think it's separate like we don't want to teach how I want teaching
 So I had this huge whiteboard map it all out and then I was like yeah, it's awesome
 But super complex and I took a smaller white like big pad of paper like shrunk it out again
 I was like it's awesome, but still too complex got down down down to find it was like this really simple like here's the process here's what
 Here's the the framework. I think that's right where I'm looking for framework. Here's the framework of how I'm going to teach this concept
 So for example
 This this presentation I'm working on for the first 40 hours is called conversation domination and it's basically like how to how to like
 Dominate the conversation everywhere on every single platform every single channel all at the same time
 And I bought one of my friends used to own a product called conversation domination
 I bought the brand and the domain stuff from them
 So I was gonna be the title of it and then I needed a structure
 So a framework so they took all that time like a day and a half just get the framework to simplify
 It's like oh, here's the framework which if you get all my books work
 Dotcom secrets experts secrets like it's all about a framework right like doodles or my framework and I can teach off the framework
 It's now I've got a framework and then you like how to make this sexy so conversation nomination sexy
 but we need a really sexy headline and
 And so that's I'm gonna go inside and find headline right now. It's like a great you guys
 But we had to get the headline
 That's like that's that's part of the hook right there is like getting the headline that's
 Gonna capture people so then they see a presentation the like oh crap like I actually do want to I do want to hear that
 I want to you know
 I want to know what he's gonna be be talking about so that was the next piece was
 pulling out the
 The headline and I'm walking through the office right now. We're live everybody. What's up?
 Anyway, so we're pulling out the headline and that was kind of next step in the process
 So let me come in here and show you guys
 Who are watching if you're listening. I'll read it to you, but okay here. We are in the office
 so
 All right, so the headline end up being
 This is after probably probably two and a half three hours of like headlining back and forth the whole bunch of people
 So again doesn't just it's not just a fast process like most of the time is going in these little things that set up the framework for everything out
 So conversation nomination
 This is a headline I came up with how to get your dream clients addictively binge watching you on every platform that they live on
 Warning this aggressive approach only is only for those who truly believe in their message
 So for those who are watching here's a little picture of you can see those you're listening out to the headline, right?
 So I'm gonna headline there was like okay now. I got I've got the title. I've got the hook with the headline
 and then
 I've got the framework for me to teach and then lastly and you make it sexy and this is where design comes like
 We need to make this thing look amazing and so kind of the storyline behind this presentation and then I'll get to that
 I'm gonna tell you too much the storyline because that I can go on for hours about that
 But those who were felt like hacking live the presentation here the story behind it
 But it's basically likening social media to TVs back in 1965 and so how it works
 And so like if you look at the design here, those who are watching you can see it's like design like an old TV set
 And just look awesome
 So I had this and I got the title the headline done and I sent it over to Julie Stoyne
 Who is not employees this week?
 It gets her wishes you wanted to be here, but we had too much stuff
 By centuary and then she wrote back she said it in all caps
 How do you make everything so sexy and then I said hi?
 That's a big secret and then she shared me a screenshot from someone in her group and said from Karen Wolf Millen
 And said how is it that Russell Brunswick can make the seven phases of a funnel sound so sexy lol
 I'm coming slightly obsessed with funnels. It's you know, that was literally 12 minutes ago my group
 And so what I want to share there's the whole point of this podcast one shares like you have to make your thing sexy
 I could have been like here's how to drive traffic to your offers the bore
 I hear is how to be seen on YouTube Instagram and Facebook boring right like like
 It's got to be something that like captures people it's different this unique that people will remember forever
 Right, I think so many times I see people like my funnels not working like I go look at it's just so bland and like
 Of course not like you don't have a good hook. You don't have a good headline. You don't have a good
 Design there's nothing interesting or intriguing. There's no story behind like what's the what's the whole thing like this presentation?
 I literally I thought I start with the head with the the title right hey guys this presentation called conversation nomination
 I'm gonna show you how to get your dream clients addictively
 binge watching you on every social platform that they're living on and warning this aggressive approach and
 Infillates who are truly believing their in their message, right? Then I go into the story
 So I'll tell you the story
 There's this clip bubble water tell the story about TV 965 explain that whole thing and I'll also there there's intrigue
 There's interest and now I can move to the framework and flows who are looking at the framework
 Those who are watching live or she's been watching the video. You can see a picture of the framework here
 I clear off all my mess. Sorry
 Week before events things become a mess like I 8,000 papers open ever
 But here's the framework and that framework started out as this framework on this whiteboard here
 And then shifted into a whole bunch of pads of paper like this try to simplify it more and more and more to find it out of this
 And that's the framework I can teach so it's cool
 But now like when I do my presentation like this is life to teach
 I could if I did no slides I could go up on a whiteboard
 I can map this out and I explained this piece and this piece and this piece and like
 That's why I can do really simply now if I want to go complex
 I can go make five or six slides explaining each one and showing pictures like visual demonstrations of each thing
 Which is probably what I learned doing, but worst case I have the framework now
 I can go and I could present this tonight and I could do a 90-minute presentation with nothing
 But this framework like when I when I teach a lot of times people think like how in the world you get up stage without any
 Preparations and speak for like an hour or two hours or five hours
 I'm like well
 I sent them back before and I try to build out a framework where I wanted to create okay
 And then I've been a brand new buchard
 You just tell me said the framework is your savior like if you've got a framework like this you always know where you're going
 You're just like you put the thing in you talk talk talk talk and then you stop you okay
 What's the next thing okay? Here's next thing here's the next thing next thing so for me my frameworks always these doodle graphs
 Like I could go and if someone wanted me to teach a lesson, you know teach a three-day event tomorrow on dot-com secrets
 I wouldn't have to rehearse anything
 I would just go get the book plot framework plot the images and talk off the image and show it
 It would be neat not hard because like the framework
 Shows me where my mind needs to go when you talk about how it all fits together
 It makes it very very clear so for you guys I want you thinking when you're making presentation
 You're trying to sell stuff and you're trying to like create things like that
 There's some things to be thinking about like it's got to be sexy right?
 It's got a sexy hook that grabs them that like looks interesting headline that like
 That sucks them in and there's a story that gets them to care about it and then there's a framework where you deliver
 Deliver the big all the big promise you gave them during the headline. So anyway, what kind of helps because I know
 Just even people here my team is really just like why have you spent 40 hours?
 All you have is a headline and some doodles and make cuz that's the most important part everything else is just details
 So there you go hope you guys I have to go and lock down and now make 150 slides for this presentation and then do the same process
 For the other five actually I'm gonna do this process for the five first because this is the hardest part
 This is the brain work
 Then it's just like you get now that have this the brain works gone next we guys have to go grab images for all these things and like
 Slap them into slides and make them look amazing. So the brain works the hard part. So all right guys

 Hey, this is Russell going to back
 So I just wanted to add to this podcast I record this morning
 And then I spent the next four hours working on the titles and hooks and everything from my next presentation
 And I just wanted to jump back in and just give you a little more cuz my I don't know this morning
 I was slow I can think so the three things that you tap hook headline and framework
 So hook is like the name of the thing the headline is the this is what the story is about and a framework then is the
 The structure of what the presentation is right?
 So I just wanted to come in here real quick to share with you for my fun-lacking live presentation. There's six
 Presentations we just went through this for all six presentations. So
 Hook the headline of the framework
 So obviously can't show the framework is they're not on them yet
 But the hook and headline are done for all these presentations now
 I just got a great framework and I got to go bust out slides. So
 Here we go presentation number one. It's called funnel hacker funnel hackers. We see things differently
 So that's the hook and the headline is actually the quote of the theme of the shows event, which is
 On the back of the shirt you guys can't see it unless you were at fun-lacking live says here's the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers the
 Round pegs and the square holes the ones who see things differently
 They're not fond of the rules and they have no respect for the status quo you can quote them disagree with them glorify
 Or vilify them by the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things
 They push the human race forward and while some see them as the crazy ones
 We see genius because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do so that's the that's the headline
 Hook for presentation number one number two conversation domination
 I told you guys this already how to eat your dream clients addictively binge watching on every platform that they that they live on
 Warning the aggressive approach is only for those who truly believe in their message hook headline boom
 Presentation number three funnel audibles. There's the hook headline how to nail it so you can scale it
 Okay, number four multi-dimensional follow-up funnels this hook headline how to win the battle of attention so you can change the lives of your
 Customers with the products and the services that you sell
 Number five the 12 month millionaire
 That's the hook and the headline 256 of your peers have joined the two comic club in the last 12 months
 Here's the behind-the-scenes process
 They are all currently using to unlock the doors to the two comic club with absolute certainty how you use the same system to launch
 Your seven figure funnel in the next 12 months boom and number six the hook breaking the chains of false belief in the headline
 What's holding you back is probably holding your customers back as well. So it's one show that because
 After the podcast is when we worked on it and now they're done and just wanted to share that
 So is your thinking through the hook the headline and the framework those are the keys any good presentation and hope it helps
 Thanks guys. Appreciate you all and talk soon. Bye
