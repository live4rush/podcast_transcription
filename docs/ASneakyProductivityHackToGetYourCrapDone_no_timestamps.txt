 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast
 I am once again cruising in my Tesla to go pick up Dave from the airport and I want to share with you some of my thoughts
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answer. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody
 You guys are doing awesome today, so I
 Had woman working over the last couple days really really hard on
 Riding the traffic secrets book which has been fun and I've kind of talked to you a little about the process of some of the stuff
 I've been doing
 But I've been also like using Instagram to tell stories and showing behind the scenes to me right in the book where I'm doing it
 And how I'm doing it it's crazy because like last week we were in an RV driving down 10 hours to Lake Powell
 And my wife was driving and I was in the RV typing the book away, right?
 And then the way home she was driving I was kind of in the backseat trying to make sure the kids don't kill each other while writing the book and then
 It's funny because it was a written book, you know how hard it is and I was listening to a podcast that Rachel
 They've holsted and they were talking about writing
 I think Rachel's talking writing her book and how like the biggest key to writing a book is word count working
 I like getting the words and getting the words in and it's hard for me because I
 Don't know I'm probably different than than some people that write their books
 But it's not just sit down and write like crazy
 It's like for me sometimes I sit there and for a day and daydreaming like you know
 I'm a I'm a visionary type of person like I see I could see it first
 I'm looking and I'm doodling try to figure out the concept in the the framework and I put all those pieces together
 And I see them like okay now I have a framework and one of the stories has seemed to each part of the framework
 And how do I do it and it comes back and then I start writing it?
 But that that thought keeps going through my head that from her Rachel was like word count word count
 So I'm like how do I increase my word county stay because my deadline is looming is getting close
 My publisher wants the book to them in about two months, which would be awesome except for those two three three things number one
 I still run a hundred and something million dollar your company, which is like, you know, not a tiny task number two
 I've got an amazing family that I love and I want them to continue to love me
 So I've got to be present with them especially now that summertime and they're you know
 I'm school anymore
 So it's like I'm trying to take less hours trying to work out in the morning with them and trying to like try to weave my kids into
 It is much as humanly possible
 Um and then the other thing is in less than two months now
 We have a big event which is the unlock the secrets event which is an event for our coaching program
 coaching members
 Which is a big thing as well. So it's like
 There's a lot of stuff happening and also, you know, and that that event is a three-day long event and I'm teaching all the sessions except for anything
 90 minutes of being taught by other people but the rest of it
 100% me which means I have three days with the presentations I'm doing and they're not tiny presentations
 In fact, I might do a podcast just talking about how I'm preparing for the event and all the stuff I'm doing for it
 But it's a it's a big it's a big ordeal to right and top that then I have to write the book
 So anyway, so it's just like if I don't keep it moving
 Like I'm gonna get in a lot of trouble and have to like pull like 22 all-meters in real
 You know from time to the the events done till the books actually do what I don't want to do
 So word counts been this thing and so I've been trying a bunch of things. I'm trying to get up early
 I'm trying to stay up late. I've been trying for things but this week was been really really good as um
 Um, one of my buddies john parks
 He gave me this gift a couple years ago some city on my desk
 It's like it looks like a big dice and there's different numbers like five 25 30 50 60 like all these different times
 And we do just sit down and you turn that to like you know if you want 60
 Mitch put the 60 if you want 10 minutes with 10 minutes up
 But it starts a timer and then you just do the task for a little while right?
 Um because there's something I can't remember top my head
 There's a whole bunch of studies that I remember reading about this probably
 Probably a decade ago
 But um that basically human mind can can focus for like an hour at our time
 I think it was like 57 or 58 minutes or something like that
 And so the whole concept is like sit down flip the thing over to an hour and then just focus for an hour
 And soon the beeps you have stopped jump up run around and reset and then come back down and do it again
 So I was like i'm gonna try that this week
 And so I did that until I got the again
 I think if you had amazon type in like cube dot timer
 Diced timer or something you'll see one like a buck or two like they're not expensive
 But I did that I put my phone upside down I turned off all my instant messenger sky facebook
 Everything that somebody could possibly contact me on and I spoke to 60 minutes
 I was like go time word count go and um that I just focused on on writing
 During that 60 minutes and it was cool because like I made a rule for myself like during the 60 minutes
 I can't I can't deviate I can't go and look at me flip my phone over
 I can't all these different things like our human minds we always want to go towards the
 You know wherever the least resistance is we want to move towards pleasure and away from pain and writing for me
 And for a lot of people I've talked about who write as well is very much pain
 So it's like you're moving towards pain. It's like
 Ah, there's all this pleasure around you want to jump to all these other things
 But I basically made it where like all those things are shut off now and all I have is the book
 And pleasure is in 60 minutes when I've done writing and I'm gonna be angry if I get to 60 minutes
 And I haven't done writing there's a lot of pain there
 So it's like I had a I got a right to get the pleasure and it forced me to to write
 And what I what I found is like it compounds
 Um the attention like no, I'm writing for five or six minutes and I'm checking my phone right five six minutes checking that you know
 Like my mind's jumping worse when I focus for an hour and like everything else is done
 I just got an hour I know an hour I got freedom man
 It it was like writing for like three or four hours in that hour and then it's the beat thing beat
 I jumped up. I checked my phone check my Facebook check my everything ran around the office
 Said hi to everybody go got a drink of water going to the bathroom like just move my body and like smile and had some fun
 Then I went back in sat down turned everything off flip the thing boom in another hour
 And in those two one-hour sessions, I got more done than I typically get probably in two days worth of writing
 Um, but then after that I was like I was I was beat up. I'm like, well, I'm good
 I'm not writing anymore today, but it was okay because I got two days worth of writing done in two hours
 And so anyway, just a thought I know that you know, you may not be writing a book
 But I do know that whenever you're moving forward in any project in business
 You're building a funnel you're writing a sales letter you're trying to create a product like all the things
 Um, our brains are always running towards the path of least existence right like it's always moving away from pain
 Um towards pleasure and it's like it's tough because you know
 The creation of the thing usually we also share a lot of pain within our minds
 Um, and so our brains always looking for other things
 And so this is just a really simple easy like three dollar way to
 To to make it simple and you would have to use a dice you could literally set a lot of on your phone on your phone
 The phone over which maybe is an even easier thing to do
 Um, but just the concept of blocking out that time
 Um, I don't remember exactly
 Oh, I remember it was
 Um, when we first launched and clicked funnels
 I was trying to convince Todd and everybody to be too boyzy because I want all my friends to boyzy, right?
 That makes total logical sense and about that time
 Um, there's a book that came out called rework and it's all about how uh base camp how they all work remote
 and um, anyway, it's really interesting
 and uh, I remember
 I remember we read that and then we kind of made a decision like it was actually make this remote team
 And so we did that and that was kind of the um, the decision and and it's been good
 But I remember it was interesting to when they in the book rework and then I also um,
 Or she's not rework is remote
 Those are both their books and both of them were amazing
 So read both rework and remote remote was the one about working remote
 um, but anyway, um
 Uh, when when I read that
 Um, and I also watched he did a TED talk about remote as well and was interesting he talked about like
 When you have to get something done, where do you go, right?
 No, this is why I go to work there. I said, well, I come in earlier. I stay later
 I work from home or whatever to get something done. It's like work doesn't actually happen at work most times
 There's so many distractions things happening
 And you know, I was looking at that like if if everyone on my team worked
 I mean just for me like
 I wrote for two solid hours
 I got more done than I did in two days because I forced myself to block everything off like
 If everyone on my team if we all set down was blocked out in just two hours of like dedicated time with nothing else
 Like I wonder what would get done how much faster things would move like
 Um, anyway, I thought it was kind of interesting and fascinating all all wrapped into it into one
 So, you know, I'm sure that he has hope that gives you some ideas and some some ways to get some stuff done
 Um, it's one of my little new productivity hacks
 I've done two days in a row and this book is gonna get done on time
 It's gonna be amazing because of it
 So all I want from you guys is commitment right now that the second traffic secrets goes live
 You go buy like a billion copies or at least one
 Um, and that way you can support all the work because I'm killing myself and it's gonna cost you like
 A couple bucks to get
 Like all the stuff that I'm doing. So hopefully it'll be a good a good exchange and value for you
 So
 Um, all right, that's why I got you guys have an amazing day
 I'm almost in the airport day. I might record another episode with you guys before I um before I go see him
 So that's that I appreciate you all have a great day and we'll talk to you all soon
