 Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson, and welcome you to the Marketing Secrets Podcast.
 Next episodes are a really special one. So we, for our two-comma club X members and our
 inner circle members, I did an event recently. Some of you guys heard me talk about it.
 And it was a traffic secrets event where I'm getting all the material ready for the book,
 I start teaching this stuff. And anyway, it was really fun. And as I was doing the presentations,
 the night before I was doing all the prep work, I had this thought. I was like, I want to bring
 up somebody on stage and it's somebody who was a friend I grew up with in elementary school,
 in junior high and high school. And someone who was down on the luck, who was really, really
 struggling. And about a year ago, I saw him post on Facebook and I reached out. And this
 interview is happening about a year later. And during the process, he tells his story about
 what happened in the transformation and the change that happened by being involved inside of our
 ClickFunnels Funhacker community. And so I wanted to share that with you as part of the event.
 And so this first half is going to be Nick kind of telling his story. And it's going to be the story
 from the bottom of the barrel where they literally made $25,000 a year for three years in a row.
 And then the transformation to this year will be well over six figures. And that's going to be
 this first podcast. And the second podcast episode is I'm actually going to be doing,
 I did a live coaching session with him on stage. And I want to show you as well, because I think
 there's a lot of things for you specifically that you could get from this episode too.
 So the next episodes are going to be sharing this really fun conversation that happened at
 late night at the Travis Seekers event with my friend Nick Fitzgerald. And if you think that
 name sounds familiar, I have talked about him before his podcast. In fact, a little over a year
 ago, I did a podcast episode called, called being a Rainmaker that was a personalized podcast that
 I sent to Nick specifically to help him with what he was struggling with at the time. So
 anyway, I wanted to share this with you because it'll take you full circle to show you kind of
 the progress and the momentum and things that are happening his life. And I think that it'll be
 encouraging for you to hear the story, because no matter where you are in a journey right now,
 if you are struggling, if you're doing well, if you're, you know, in somewhere in between,
 there are parts of this story that resonate with you. And the second episode where I coached
 Nick, I think will help everybody as well. So with that said, let's jump right in and have some fun.
 I want to introduce you to my friend, Mr. Nick Fitzgerald.
 So the big question is this, how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture
 capital for spending money from our own pockets? How do we market in a way that lets us get our
 products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain
 profitable? That was the question and this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Bronson
 and welcome to Marketing Secrets. All right, so I want to set the tone for the next hour or so
 of what the game plan is. So I have a first initial question that I'm curious about with everyone
 here. I'm curious who, since they joined the 2 Comical X program, has had some kind of experience
 with Mr. Nick Fitzgerald. Okay, that's powerful. I'm going to talk about YA in a little bit, but
 very, very cool. So some of the backstory behind this, and then we're going to introduce him up.
 When he comes up, I want you guys to go crazy and scream and cheer and clap because it'll be good
 and then I want him to sit down so it'll be the same height, which will be good. It'll be really fun.
 So some of the backstories, so I actually met Nick the very first time in elementary school,
 and even in elementary school, he was like a foot and a half taller than me, which is amazing.
 He was like six foot two in like third grade. It was amazing. But we knew each other and we were
 dorky little kids and going up through elementary school, we were both doing our things and we didn't
 have a care in the world if things happening. And then as we got older, he kept getting taller,
 I'd stopped growing and then we got into high school and he kept growing and he joined the
 basketball team and I didn't keep growing someone downstairs in the basement and literally at our
 high school, in the basement, they called the rubber room and it's this room that smells like,
 I don't even know, but it's under the gym and so he would go upstairs and they'd get fans that would
 show up, people would cheer for them and scream at their games, all the girls would come to the
 games. We'd go down in the rubber room by ourselves and we'd cut weight and we'd put our sweats and
 we'd lose weight and we'd jump rope and we'd sweat like crazy and we'd sit there. I remember one day
 after working out for two hours pouring in sweat, I had my plastic ears on my sweats on top of that,
 my hoodie and my hoods and we got the wrestling mats and we literally rolled ourselves up in the
 wrestling mats to keep the heat in and we laid there and we're so hot and I can hear the basketball
 players in the gym up above having so much fun and people cheering for them and all the girls were
 there and I was like why are we not playing basketball? It doesn't make any sense but during that time
 obviously we were in two different worlds and we didn't really connect that much and then we left
 our separate ways and I didn't hear from him for years and years and years and years and then
 you guys remember when Facebook first came out the first time you got it and you log in you're
 like oh my gosh I connect with people and you start searching in the friends you know and then
 you find their friends you spend like a day and a half connecting with every person you've ever
 remembered seeing in your entire life. Do you guys remember that? So I did that one night, I connected
 everybody like everyone in high school everyone in junior high elementary everyone in every stage
 of my life as many as I could think of and I was like I think it's everybody okay I've connected
 everybody and one of those people at night was Nick and then um but I didn't say hi just like
 friend requesting me request to back I'm like cool we're connected and then after that I got kind
 of bored with Facebook for like a year or so and then a little while later I found out you can buy
 ads on it and I was like what this is amazing so we started buying ads and everything's happening
 and and uh and it's crazy and then um what happened next I actually want Nick on stage to tell you
 the story because I want to hear it from both his perspective and my perspective I think it'd be kind
 of interesting so um um but yeah I want him to come up first so let's do this real quick um as
 you guys know Nick has been a super valuable part of this community since he came in I'm gonna tell
 us about how he got here and in some of the craziness about how he signed up we probably shouldn't have
 and what's been happening since then uh because I know you guys have all been part of that journey
 you guys been supporting how do you guys are going to his event this happening later this week
 like he just keeps giving and serving he's doing all the right things he's telling the story like
 he's doing some amazing stuff and so my plan right now is I want to talk about the rest of the story
 um I want to tell you guys what I told him a year ago and then I want to tell you guys my advice
 for her moving forward because I feel like it's almost like in proxy I wish I could do
 out with everyone you guys to sit down here and just like coach you but I feel like he's at a stage
 where some of you guys aren't towards that yet and some of you guys are past that and some of you
 guys are right where he's at and I feel like for the advice I want I really want to give him
 will help you guys at all different levels that's kind of game plan so with that said the Santa
 put her heads together for Mr. Nick Fitzgerald
 all right this has some good music all right um that's like music from high school look how
 tall I am man I feel like okay so I hadn't find this post because I wanted to actually share a
 little piece of it so this um I'm gonna share a piece that I want I want to like step back to
 where you were at that time in your life so this is July 7 2017 so when was that year and a half ago
 ish you have to go so July 7 2017 he there was a post that said long post disclaimer I hate posting
 this but a lot right so at the time my family's not going to found a vacation we're packing up the
 bags everything and like you know it is you do a bunch of work and you stop for a second and your
 wife and kids are gone you're like pull out the phone just like swap through the dream 100 she was
 happening somehow this post pops up at my feed and I see it I see Nick my buddy from like 20
 plus years ago I'm reading this thing and like my heart like sinks for him some of the things he
 says I hate posting things like this but I felt like I need to for a while being poor stinks he says
 for those friends of mine who are older conserving look down consciously not on people like me I can
 honestly tell you that I'm not a lazy freeloader who wants something for nothing I'm not a deadbeat
 who wants Obama or whoever to blame now to buy me a phone I'm not a low-life trying to get the
 government to pay for my liposuction I'm not a druggie who eats steak and lobster for dinner with my
 food stamps I'm a father of four a husband someone who lost everything financially including our home
 when the time came to have your health care in place or to get fine I went through the process
 based on my family size and income we referred to the state to apply for those programs we couldn't
 get coverage for ourselves to the exchange on the places we qualified for Medicaid after the process
 was complete the state workers suggested we tried to get some some other help some food stamps
 tangles on and on and on he says in 2016 I made $25,000 $25,000 plus our tax returns from the previous
 year so our family of six living on $25,000 a year is being audited for receiving too much help
 too much assistance and he kind of goes on and on and on with that so I've never abused drugs or
 alcohol I've never been tried them I'm just a guy trying to live the American dream provide for
 his family it's unfortunately we look down on those who are trying to better lives even if it leads
 them from receiving help from systems in place to help them look on look down on me if you want
 I don't care I know the truth my family's healthy and sheltered that's all that matters
 I don't want your child's anyone else it kind of goes on from there so I want to take back to
 that moment and like what was talk about what your experience what we were going through during that
 that time I didn't expect this but um I'm a friendly giant but I'm a big boob too so
 back back at that time so I had started what I thought was I started my entrepreneurial journey
 I was working in film full-time working 12 14 16 hour days making 200 bucks a day you know just
 killing myself for my family and going through the process of you know I lost my job because I
 wasn't going to hit myself I was a financial advisor and I wasn't going to hit my sales number so
 you know my ticket was stamped right so I said okay I'm going to do my own thing and in the course
 of all of that you know it was time to get your health insurance and those things and I went
 through the proper channels like I felt like I should and I was referred to the government for
 the programs because of based on the numbers and for as a as a provider as a father and you know
 an athlete competitor I felt like a failure right we've all when you have to
 rely on somebody else or somebody else tells you hey like we don't think you can do this on your own
 come over here and we'll take care of you right that's that's basically what I was told
 and so it was hard to accept that and to live with that reality but so we did I worked hard and
 it was a blessing really to not have to worry about how much health care costs or have some
 things to supplement to feed our family and stuff so it was it was great and it was wonderful
 but then I got the email from the state saying like hey you're being audited we we're just looking
 at things and we're not sure if you're you've been getting too much help and so at that point I'm
 just sitting there frustrated because I'm working my butt off just trying to make things happen
 become somebody involved in the film community in Utah and I was and everyone knew me and I had
 a reputation but I still you know was a nobody I in the eyes of the government right and so I
 went to Facebook to wine looking for what I want looking for what I wanted which was a pat on the
 back and like they're there Nick you're doing we know you're a good dude and you're working hard
 and you know that kind of thing and I did I was reading comments last night I said oh no well
 you're doing good job man good luck everyone like babying him out right tough life can be yeah and
 so I got what I wanted but it wasn't you know I still didn't change anything I still had to submit
 my last two years of tax returns and all of the pay that I got and and everything like that so they
 could look at our case number not Nick Liesl Khloe you and Alec William so yeah and so
 it was just one of those things so I got what I wanted then comes Russell to give me what I needed
 which was so I saw that and I'm like attacking the kids bags everything I was like how do I say
 something like I don't be that guy like hey 20 years ago and I was like I get filming this and I was
 like hey man I know we haven't talked in like over 20 years just a Facebook mission we're talking
 like 20 years I saw your post today and it sucks and I know what's wrong and I can help but at the
 same time I don't I don't want to be that guy and I don't want to I don't want to step on
 your toes I know we haven't talked in 20 years I have no idea if it's even appropriate but I know
 what's wrong I can help you and know this is not some cheesy I'm not trying to piss you on but
 if you're in some coaching I know I know what's wrong and that kind of waited and that's packing
 the bags and stuff like that I'm curious like your thoughts initially as you saw that well it's
 it's funny because the my phone is kind of blowing up with the comments right so I would hear the
 little ding and I would I would check and then I saw that it was a message from Russell and we had
 like we had said like hey what's up and like had a few tiny little small talk conversations really
 but nothing in-depth personal right and so I saw that he sent a message and so I'm like
 sweet you know so I look at it and I was half expecting because I knew I knew that he was
 successful I didn't know about click thumbnails per se like I you know I knew that he had something
 going on that was awesome but I didn't know what it was so I was wondering I wonder what he's gonna
 say what he has to say about things but I read it and it was funny because when you said like I
 don't want to overstep my bounds I don't want to you know it's been a long time I don't want to
 step on toes kind of thing I you know Russell we all know his athletic accolades and stuff I was
 a great basketball player too I was in the top 200 players in the country my senior year and stuff
 like that so I've been coachable and I've played at high levels and been coached by high level guys
 and so when I read it and he said I can I know what's wrong and I can help you I was like yes
 you know I that's that was my reaction I was just I just did the little you know
 the little fist pump let's do this right and so I replied back and I thanked him for reaching out
 and stuff and I just said I think I even said I'm coachable like I will accept any guidance and
 things like that because up up and to that point in my life especially with sports if a coach showed
 me something I would do it with the way he did it and I would I would kick the other dudes but I
 didn't care I've played against guys who made millions of dollars in the NBA I don't I post
 rise on Sean Marion the one who's at UNLV my freshman year of college I like I started as a
 freshman at a division one school in college so like I would take I've always been that kind of
 when I get that guidance in that direction I can put it to work so I was like dude mr. Miyagi right
 you like to teach me I'm eight I'm eight days older than him so I'm like young grasshopper yes
 you can teach me right that kind of thing so I I welcomed it and I was excited I had no idea
 because again I didn't know what he did person you know I just knew he had a level of success
 that I didn't have and if he was willing to give me some ideas I was gonna hear him out for sure
 it was fun so then I messaged it back because I'm like packing the cars and cuts like we gotta
 go we gotta go I was like oh so I get the thing out I was like all right this is the deal I'm driving
 to bare legs like a six hour drive right now I'm gonna give you an assignment and if you do it
 then I'll give you the next piece but most people never do it so if you don't that's cool and all
 this no it's not one time but if it's really worth your time do this thing I need you to go back
 and listen to my podcast from episode one listen as many episodes as possible and if you do that
 I'll make you customize episode just for you telling you exactly what's wrong how to fix it
 but you have to do that first and I'm not telling you it's gonna have some ego trip and like just
 but just trust me the problem is not your skillset you have mad skill that you're good
 everything it's all a problem between your ears if we can shift that we can shift everything else
 and I jumped my car and took off and I started driving for six hours and then like the next day
 or the day later you're like I'm 14 episodes in he was still listening to crappy ones according
 to Stephen Larson and you're on top yeah that the marketing is crazy he's probably this is the
 worst thing I've ever heard ever but he did it right I said do it he said did it and kept doing it
 kept doing it and so today's in my family vacation I had Nora he has all known Nora right she's the
 coolest but she won't go to bed at night she's a nightmare don't let her cute face trick you she's
 evil right and so I'm like I can't go to sleep to find out like I'm gonna plug her in the car and
 drive around the lake until she falls asleep the plug in the car strap it in and start driving
 and I'm like this could be a long long she's just smiling back here and I'm like oh and I was like
 you know what I'm gonna do my episode for Nick so I got my phone out I clicked record and for
 almost an hour didn't I it was an hour I'm driving around the lake and I'm explaining to him what I
 see they want to hear listen to that episode I'm curious yeah um case I'm gonna map out really quick
 the core concept because some of you is maybe stuck in this so because the goal of this what I
 want to do is I want to map this out and then what's funny is last year at Bear Lake so a year
 later we had this thing I was like we should do a second round where I do like a year later this
 is what like the vice now and I rode a whole outline for and I totally never did it and so
 I'm gonna go to the outline for now kind of show in the next phase so you cool if I still kind of
 what I talked about for sure all right for those who missed the podcast episode who haven't been
 binge listening you've all failed the test now you must go back to episode number one listen to
 cheesy jingle and get to episode four on whatever it was okay I said this I said okay if you look at
 any business any organization there's three core people right the first one is the person at the
 top who is the entrepreneur okay that said the cool thing about the entrepreneurs the entrepreneurs
 the one that makes the most amount of money right like they're the head that said the most amount
 of money the problem with the entrepreneurs they also the most risk so the more likely to
 like lose everything right like I've lost everything multiple times because I might be
 guy risking everything but the nice thing is like entrepreneurs right they don't pay check there's
 no ceilings right so they can make as much as they want they can make a million ten million
 hundred million they can do whatever they want because there's no ceiling right so that's the
 first personality type so the second personality type over here is what we call the technicians
 okay the technicians are the people that actually do the work right it was funny if you look at this
 these people go to college with the technicians right and what do they do they look down on
 entrepreneurs they look down on sales be like oh you're in sales like what are you a doctor for
 crying out loud in the night but they're like they look down on on on people like us right because
 like I'm a doctor into 45 years of school now what's interesting is that there's technicians in all
 sorts of different spots right I actually feel bad I shouldn't say this out loud but um on the airport
 here I was saw one of my friends who's an amazing doctor and him and his wife were leaving on a
 trip and we're talking and he said this is the first trip my wife and I have been on in 25 years
 together by ourselves he's like what he's like well we had medical school and then we had
 kids and then we had a payoff medical school and all these things now the kids are gone and I
 would finally have a chance to leave I was like wow our whole life were fed that like medical
 school become a doctor's this anyway all right that's a rant for the other day but I was like
 there's technicians right and what's interesting about technicians is they don't have any risk right
 so there's no risk whatsoever but they do have a there's a price ceiling on every single person
 that's a technician right and depending on what job you have your pricing is different right so
 doctor the price ceiling is I have no idea doctor to make 500 grand a year it's like the pricing
 that's amazing but like that's they can't go above that right and different tasks different roles
 different positions all different price ceilings but there's like you know this role as a technician
 makes about this much and this one makes this much and you're all kind of these things right
 I said the problem with you right now you got these amazing skill sets but you are stuck as a technician
 in a role when they're tapping out with the only thing you can make is 25k a year
 and remember I asked you I'm like what have you been doing you're like oh I've been networking
 I've been learning I've been getting my skills up I'm getting amazing I'm like that's amazing your
 skills are awesome but your ceiling's 25k a year yeah no matter how good you get you are stuck because
 you're in a technician role right now I said so you got a couple options number one is going to
 become an entrepreneur which is scary especially you got four kids at home you don't have money
 anyway right I'm so eternally grateful that when I started this game my why I mean first off we
 have kids yet my wife was my wife was working we had any money but I didn't have to have any
 money that time and like I'm so grateful that I was able to lose the time because I was able to
 risk things I that nowadays is hard like if you come jump on your own initially and just be like
 boom I'm not sure where I'm like I'm selling this stuff that's scary right because you've got all
 this all this risk so I was like that's the thing but it's gonna be really really hard I said but
 there's the good news there's one more spot in this ecosystem and the cool spot is that it's just
 like the entrepreneur there's no ceiling now the third spot over here so we call the rainmakers
 right yeah the rainmakers are the people that come into a business they know how to make a rain
 okay this is the people who know how to bring people into a company okay leads they bring leads
 and they know all this traffic stuff we're talking about these are people who have to sell the leads
 and actually get money out of people's wallets and put it into the hands of the entrepreneur these
 people right here the rainmakers don't have ceilings that companies who give the rainmakers
 the ceiling are the stupidest people in the world because the rainmaker will hit the ceiling and
 they'll stop right if you're smart and you have a company of rainmakers people driving traffic
 people doing sales if you have a ceiling they will hit it and then they will stop okay but you get
 rid of the ceiling and then all of a sudden they have much they want they have less risk than the
 entrepreneur but they have the ability to make unlimited amount of money I said your skill set
 over here as a technicians were 25k a year but do you take your skill set you shift it over here
 you say I come in a company I'm a rainmaker I create videos I create stories those so
 more products more things suddenly you're not worth 25 000 now you're worth 100 000
 dollars you're worth 500 000 dollars with all sort you're worth whatever you're able to do because
 there's no ceiling anymore and that was the point of the podcast I got done sending it and then I
 sent it to him and I sent it to my brother to edit and I have no idea what you thought about it at
 that point because we didn't talk a lot about it but I'm curious where you went from there so
 the first thing you know being told that I was really only worth 25 000 in the eyes of the people
 who were hiring me that was a punch in the gut that sucks to hear thanks man and you know it was
 just like because I literally was working 12 14 16 hour days lifting heavy stuff I did a lot with
 lighting and camera work not necessarily the the story writing stuff but you know I was and it was
 for him to put it so perfectly that I was a technician I thought I thought going in so when
 I failed as an advisor and I started my own company or started doing videos for people and being so
 scared to charge somebody 250 bucks for a video being like who are they're gonna say no you know
 that kind of thing and now you know I wouldn't blink my eyes for that but you know it's like one of
 those things for him to tell it to me that way and just straightforward being like like you're you
 are you're learning great skills you're meeting amazing people I worked with Oscar winners and
 Emmy winners and stuff in the movies and shows that I worked on but again I was only worth that
 much they had they had a finite amount of money and I was a small part of it so I got a small piece
 and so listening to all of that and then hearing that like the entrepreneur like the risk and stuff
 I'm I'm a look I'm really tall I'm six nine if you didn't know I'm a sinker swim guy but because
 I'm tall I can reach the bottom of the pool a lot easier so when I jumped in like we had lost as a
 financial advisor we lost our home and we lost all these things so I was like I have nothing else
 to lose like worst case scenario and I had never heard that mindset before we were renting a basement
 from a family member we had our cars were paid off you know like worst case scenario is we
 stay there and get food stamps and that kind of thing there was nowhere to go but up from there so
 for me I was just so excited I'm like I want to be a rainmaker I want to be an entrepreneur but I
 didn't know where to find the people that I could do that for so I was in this thing where I was
 still getting lots of calls to work as a technician but I didn't want to do that anymore I didn't want
 to put myself my body my family through me being gone and then when I'm home I'm just a bump on a
 log because I'm so wiped out you know all that kind of stuff and so that was my biggest first thing
 the action point for me as I started thinking like okay how do I transition out of this how do I
 get myself out and start meeting the right people the right kinds of clients who do have budgets and
 things like that and how do I make it rain for them so that's when I made that shift from working as
 a technician I told myself I'm not going to do it anymore the last time I technically worked as a
 technician was about nine months ago it was for a friend you're right and so I made that shift
 and it was just amazing like we talked like Russell was talking about earlier when you when you
 start to track it or when it's part of your mindset things start to show up and happen you meet the
 right people and stuff and so those things just started just by listening to that one hour long
 thing I started changing and then the the black box I got expert secrets and dot com secrets and
 start going through that as well and it was just like that you see in the funnel hacker tv like
 you go that moment where the guy goes like that's what happened with me it was like a whole new
 world you know like Aladdin was singing he was Aladdin and I was jasmine right with with the beard I can
 show you the world exactly so but that's what really like literally happened with me so it's cool
 all right so this this is like summertime and so he's going through this process now figuring
 things changing shifting things like changing his mindset we go through summer we go through
 Christmas and then last year's funnel hacking live we in February of March last year
 March and so we forced funnel hacking live we kind of just touched base everyone's mind
 my seeing that things are going to be like oh things are going good and figure things out
 and then full act live is coming and I remember because we're sitting there and I think he messes
 me or something like oh fun act like it was awesome I wish I could make it I was like why don't you
 come and you're like I just can't make it yet I was like how about this man I guarantee you if
 you show up it'll change your life forever I'm not gonna pay for flights in your hotel but if
 you can figure out how to get there I'll give you a free ticket and that's last I said and I
 if you can come let me know and that's that's it and I didn't really know much because you guys know
 the middle funnel hacking live like my life is chaos I'm trying to figure out how to juggle them
 and all that stuff right and so next thing I know a funnel hacking live we're sitting there and during
 the session looking out and I see Nick standing there in the audience and I was like I have no idea
 we got there but he's there like freaking good for him like that's that's and I've known how did you
 get there I wasn't probably an easy process for you is it no credit cards right it was I it was
 one of those things I looked I looked at flights as soon as we had that conversation you know I
 it was funny because I was I can't remember what was going on but it was a day or two before I
 responded back to his invitation and I was like I'd be stupid to say no you know I have no idea
 how I'm gonna get there I'll hit I think I've said like I'll hitchhike if I have to to get there right
 could you imagine this giant Sasquatch on the on Route 66 trying to get to Florida right
 but I told my wife about it and you know this is where Russell and I have this in common like
 my wife is incredible and super supportive and she let me she let me go and we didn't have the
 money in the bank so I said I'm gonna put this on the credit card and as soon as I get back I'm
 gonna go to work and it'll they'll pay it off you know I'll get a couple clients and it'll be fine
 and so I booked the hotel luckily I was able to get somebody who wasn't gonna be able to go at the
 last minute and I got their hotel room and I got the flight and I came in and I was in the tornado
 warnings like circling the airport for five hours like the rest of you were but so I got there and
 I just remember I was just so excited and like walking in the room the very first day like the
 door's open and well you all know what it's like I don't have to relive the story but like
 I remember I walked in and I had like the hair on my arms and it was just like right it was just
 like incredible just the energy and the feeling and I was like this is so cool and then the very
 first speech like I was like that was worth every penny to get here if I left right now it would
 have all been worth it right and you all know because you're sitting here you felt that too so
 that was my like getting there it was like honey I know we don't have the money we have
 space on the credit card and when I get home I swear I'll work hard and it'll be okay right
 and she's like okay go and so so I did and it's cool all right so now I want to talk about not date
 one or day two but on day three a full-time life I guess remember happened on day three
 Russell sneak attacked all you guys I was like if I started going secret one secret two secret
 three all of you guys like all right here it is sitting back I was like how do I do the perfect
 webinar I thought people know it's the perfect webinar and I'm figuring this whole thing out trying
 to figure out and we both did an ice presentation and created an amazing offer for this program
 you guys are all in and as you know all of you guys got excited you're on the back you signed up
 and now you're here but you told me this person I hope you were willing to share this but I thought
 it was amazing because you didn't sign up that night and I love to hear what happened from then
 till the next day and kind of go through that process yeah so this is my first click funnels
 that I got I was all new to this whole thing and I was so excited when the 12 month millionaire
 presentation came up and I was like this is awesome and then I see in the stack and I'm like I'm
 seeing the the wizard is pulled I can see the wizard doing his thing right I was just so excited
 and then the price and it was a punch in the gut to me because I was so I'm like listening to
 I'm like this is what I need this is what I want this is what I need everything and it's gonna
 it's gonna be amazing and then the the price came and like seriously it just like the rest of the
 night I was just like the rest of the presentation and and and everything after that I was just kind
 of like like zoned out I just didn't know what to do because I knew I needed it so badly but I was
 like that's almost twice what we're paying in rent right now you know it was just like how am I
 gonna justify this when I you know I'm on food stamps and Medicaid and all this kind of stuff like
 oh I'm yes I'm on that but I drop this money on a coaching program right
 I'm like from this internet coach right and and so I'm having this mental battle and I get back
 home to my room that night and I didn't go hang out with people or I just was not feeling it and I
 remember like texting my wife on the white on the walk back to the room and I took the long way
 around the pond you know just slowly depressively meandering back to my room right and I'm texting
 her and I'm telling her it was how amazing it was and what the program would do and and all that
 kind of stuff she's like that sounds great and you know I'm like purposely not saying how much it's
 gonna cost just to get her excited about it so then I can maybe do a stack with her right and be like
 well for this mist you know see if I could try it I didn't but I failed when it came to like you
 know doing that and I told her the price and she's like that's a lot of money like how are you gonna
 pay for it I'm like I don't know and I'm like the only thing I could do because I have to like sign
 up while I'm here and pay for it while I'm here like I could put it on the credit card and then
 we will figure it out right but so we talked a lot and I talked to my dad and it was the same thing
 he was just like and that's a lot you know just like the scarcity mindset that a lot of us have
 with our family members and support system that aren't don't think we're who aren't the crazy ones
 and so I went to bed and you know I got emotional and stuff like that and I slept so so bad I just
 didn't sleep very well that whole night and again I talked to my wife again in that next morning
 and I just we just said it would be awesome but we can't I can't do it so I'm just gonna work hard
 and just figure something out and then if it ever opens up again then I'll be in a position to do it
 so that I left my room that morning with that in my mind I made the mistake of keeping my wallet
 in my pocket though right because I'm here right so I again made the long walk back and kind of
 get myself a pep talk like don't don't worry about that kind of stuff just like get more value out
 of it meet more people all that so that's when I left my room the next morning that was where my
 mind was they'll happen next I walked into the room and Kevin Anson who I had it's funny he he
 does a lot of editing for for ClickFunnels and he and I had actually met like independent of ClickFunnels
 before like it was one of those things like oh you do oh my gosh it was like two months after we'd
 met right so I was talking to him just chit chatting and I just had right then in my mind is like walk
 over to the table and sign up if you don't do it now you're never gonna do it and it was just one of
 those things because I told I'd given myself that speech that whole five minute walk across the
 property and so I finished up talking with him and I just said I'll be right back and I walked
 straight over to the table got out the credit card and wrote it all down and I'm like I don't
 even know what my limit is so I hope whenever they run this that it's it goes through or you know I
 don't know what's gonna happen so I did and I got that little silver ribbon that we all got and again
 like the chills like I was just like holy crap this is amazing I put it on my little lanyard thing
 and I was just like I couldn't believe it you know just like the adrenaline and all that stuff that
 I'm doing it and my wife is going to kill me when I get back home so you know so that's then I went
 and got my seat and I just was like floating you know I was just like so amped like I could have
 Steven Larson did and just like screamed over the noise of everybody else and it would have been
 very you would have heard it right so that's what that's what I did that morning I was like nope I'm
 not gonna do it not gonna do it not gonna do it I walked in 60 seconds done you have my money right
 so I'm curious when did you tell you why it's like a marriage counseling session yeah
 do you have a couch I can lay down on no big couch yeah really just so I got home and I
 didn't tell her at all I didn't because I said okay the clock is ticking I have 30 days till that
 hits again and or or you know 20 days till the credit card statement comes and she's like wait
 why is there an extra 2,000 bucks on here right and so I just I said I've got some time because
 my wife is she's five three eight she's dainty little petite lady and but you know she's not scary I
 guess but like I was like oh this is the first time I was really like scared to tell her something in
 our marriage so I I just said I'm gonna I'm just gonna hit the road hard and see what I can come up
 with to at least cover the 1800 and the hotel like for the what I racked up at Funnel Hacking Life
 and then that will give me another 30 days to figure something out right so I went and I
 never told her until the credit card standing came and she saw it and she's like what's this
 but what happened before that I don't know do you have something after that or you want me to go
 on this next part okay so me going to work in like I might I got to find it and it was funny like
 that night at Funnel Hacking Life I I went on Facebook and I I created like some like you know half
 thought through offer was like hey if I can get if I can get like five people locally where I'm at
 to like do a monthly load number where I create a couple of videos from a month old retainer
 that'll cover it and I can figure it but nobody nibbled on it right so I got home and I started
 you know just trying to figure stuff out and I had met another lady who had a company and she
 used clicked uses click funnels for her course it was funny be well I talked to her before I went
 to Funnel Hacking Life and we were talking and she was like you know click funnels I was like that's
 so crazy I do you know because I'd never met anybody else that that had and so I got home and I shot
 a little video with her it was a test to do some modules for her course and she loved it and it
 was great and so we were talking about she had like 20 videos she wanted to do and we were talking
 about budget and I just said you know what to for that much for those that many videos and all
 this kind of stuff it's going to be $25,000 and she didn't even blink she's like perfect that's great
 right
 and thank you
 and uh
 you guys
 thank you
 and that was
 like maybe two weeks after I got home that that happened and I left her house and I tried
 my hardest not to do like a jump heel click going down her driveway her out to my car
 and I got I got around the corner and I I messaged Russell and I was like dude you never guess
 I just closed my first five-figure deal and this is what it was and you know and he was like that's
 so cool you know but it was um the whole plot to outplomo thing like I would never had the guts
 to ask for something like that I know that I should and that my skills and what I can do are
 worth that and more and it's been proven to me again and again since then but to ask the first time
 that first time you have a big ask and like you're just throwing yourself out there and if she
 would have said no what now what am I going to do it because I actually done another pitch where I
 did like a webinar pitch where I had a stack and slides and stuff because it had it was for a chamber
 of commerce I wanted to charge them like 2,500 a month to do like four videos for a year and I did
 the whole thing like if you do it it's 2,500 a month or if you do it all right now it's that you
 know I got a whole and they passed on it you know I was like oh so it was just one of those things
 where it being around y'all right like being that was my first experience being around entrepreneurs
 really I have friends who have had businesses but like I felt weird for wanting to create my own
 thing or being selfish because I have four kids like why don't you go get a real job all those
 conversations that you hear and have with yourself especially when things aren't going great but it
 was it was like okay I have to get it done or I have to drop out and I just even in that short
 amount of time I had received so much value from the people that I had been beginning to meet and
 then as the content started coming out I was like there's no way that I could live without this
 every after having a taste of it right so that was my uh it's had to get it done and it worked out
 amazing oh I love that story all right so since then how do you guys watch his uh
 daily or almost daily Facebook lives pretty much almost like I'll miss something
 is the watch his daily Facebook lives ish okay he's doing what's saying right he's doing it he's
 doing it he's doing it I see it over it I see it I see it comes with my feet he pops my thing over
 and over he's doing what we're talking about he's attracting people he's telling stories he's like
 all the stuff we're talking about he's been doing it okay but part of it was like he had to have
 that emotion that that plot toward poem a moment and then he hit it and then it's just like he's
 been running and running and running and it's been so insanely fun to watch the progress and the
 growth I mean he's to me as no he put out an event that's coming up this weekend and sold out in
 like five seconds he's like oh I sold out should I like make it bigger I'm like no people should
 respond you faster it's their fault like sell it out because next time it'll be easier to sell out
 again easier to sell out again be did by by doing tons of value telling stories telling stories
 telling stories providing more value to you guys to other entrepreneurs other people in the community
 and people are noticing right all the stuff we talked about today he's doing it consistently
 consistently consistently doing it okay um I was so cool I don't know where to go from here all right
 I don't want to go from here okay um um before I move into this uh was it scary
 all of it scary oh yeah well this is what back to my competitive days I didn't care who I've
 played against the best players in the country at higher levels and I didn't care if you were
 going to the NBA being recruited by Duke and once we got in the lines I didn't care who you were
 I was going to make you look silly I would I would hold I was you wouldn't score a point on me or I
 would just like outwork you and if you wanted to get anywhere I was in your face the whole time right
 and so this was a whole different game for me I remember Myron talking about in his speech at
 Funnel Hacking Live like you have to stay in the game long enough to learn the game and I was new
 to this game like brand new like less than less than 12 months when I went to Funnel Hacking Live right
 and it was it was terrifying because not necessarily because I didn't think I could do it I was just
 worried when how long it would take really like am I going to go and I'm just going to spin my
 wheels and it's going to be 15 years like uh 2099 and I'm wheeling up across to get my
 reward from him and his wheelchair and I was like hey buddy you know that kind of thing or like I
 just didn't know how to make it happen quick uh that kind of stuff so I was definitely scared
 not necessarily failing because I had failed before but I was just scared how long it was going to take
 well the best moments for me was the summer him and his family were driving home from I can't
 remember they're driving through buoys he's like I'm just gonna say hi my kids want to meet my
 wife wants to meet you and obviously it's a scary thing you have met someone's wife or kid you're
 like what if they hate me and I remember it and then I started thinking like oh my gosh like he
 spent all his money coming out here and then he bought the thing like she might legitimately want
 to kill me like I have no idea I was a little bit nervous and I came and met them at the kid super
 cool and I said one of the coolest thing um your wife just looked at me she said thank you
 and I was like how cool is that I just the coolest thing like thank you for convincing
 for whatever the things are to do this thing I think sometimes as entrepreneurs we fill the guilt
 or the nervousness of like ah should I sell somebody something like is it right is it wrong it's like
 you have to understand that when you're doing it like it's not it's not a selfish thing for you
 it's like how do I get this person to take the action they need to do because most people don't
 do it until they make an investment it's just the human nature they'll keep dinking around and
 dinking around and do whatever it is but until like they have a commitment till they make that
 covenant like Lemire talked about earlier people don't change right and so in any aspect of life
 you want some make it change like there's got to be there's got to be something that caused enough
 pain to cause the change which is why we have the program we could have priced the program really
 cheap I was like no we were like we legitimately wanted to make a plot for a poem a moment for
 everybody you notice when the program signed up not everybody was signed up here today some
 people fell away some of them left like things happen right I totally understand but I wanted
 to make it painful enough that we get people to move and there are people in this room I've
 joked about like Nick probably shouldn't have bought that if you would ask I'm like no dude
 what are you thinking why would you do that as a friend like this is weird but I'm so great are
 you grateful you did absolutely I think we're some Marie Larson she's still in here I talk
 less than a podcast yes she was in the same situation like she should not have signed up for
 it it's insane I think I saw this text she said see me she's like how much did you have in your bank
 account when you signed up for it?
 $70 in the bank account $1,800 a month bill she signed up for right and then she started
 happening and she was freaking out it's going and if you guys haven't listened to the podcast
 and lean in yet I told this whole story um but he got nervous right month one hit month two
 happened she's like oh my gosh like I need to leave I can't afford this and she talked to
 Steven and Steven's like well you could leave him walk away or you could lean in
 and so she said okay I'm gonna lean in and she leaned in and I've watched this her business
 over the last three four five six months is growing it's growing it's growing because she leaned in
 tough times will come every single time it comes but like those who lean in the ones who make it
 through that and then who grow and who build huge businesses. One more marketing secrets if so
