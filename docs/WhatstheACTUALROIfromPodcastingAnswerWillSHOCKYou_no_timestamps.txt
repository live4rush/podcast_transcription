 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing stickers podcast. We got three special episodes for you the first one
 Well, actually all three of them are with my guest host Josh 40. We've been breaking down some cool things the first episode
 What happened the first episode was really good. Yeah, we talked about podcasting
 Number one you know about podcasting why we do it how we do it the reasons behind and a whole bunch of other things
 If you haven't been doing a podcast yet
 It's gonna sell you on why you need to do one if you have done one
 It's gonna show you guys why and how to amplify it why it's so important and how to find your best buyers from it
 I hope you guys enjoyed this episode. Well cute theme song will be right back
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is also Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 What's up everybody welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast like I said today next actually couple episodes
 I've got a guest host with me which I'm pumped for
 We actually did two podcasts. Well, technically they're podcast ups with your podcast, right?
 Yeah, I ripped them from my podcast
 So good one is after the Atlas shrug book Josh 40 flew out and we did how long we went for like it was three and a half
 Hours. Yeah hours. Yeah, we never hours now going deep now the shrug was really fascinating
 I should just reread it recently some one around two we should totally do that and then
 And then after the that would in the devil book
 I freaked out and then Josh flew out we didn't one there so you guys have
 Been listening to podcast are familiar with him and his voice, but I asked him
 I'm just like and I love looking the podcast sometimes like I fall behind and my brother who does our podcast settings like
 Russell any episode today, I'm like
 Huh, I don't even know to think you know and I was like I need I want someone to help come up with ideas
 Which aren't just me and so Josh from our community asked a bunch of questions and the next couple episodes are gonna be some some fun conversation
 So I'm pumped man, and thank you for doing this
 I know this is you know, you're doing this pro boner to hang out and you know just to help me out
 So I appreciate that and I'm excited to find out what people want to know about yeah for sure
 I mean the I love podcasting right I mean this is that's my life, right?
 If I could do one thing it would just be have a show that just we just talk all the time
 So this is this is like fun for me, right?
 It's like asking you to come hang out and geek out about funnels, right?
 So I'm super super excited though. It's gonna be super cool
 And kind of dive in further and pick your brain and kind of open up a new world that I don't think a lot of people get to see
 You know, it's interesting cuz like I think I feel like that when it's like me doing my own podcast
 It's like I pick a topic I go into but it's fun when I guess I had a chance to speak at a virtual event thing
 And you know I did my thing in the end people ask questions. It's just like oh I never
 You know, it opens up a different side, you know, I normally do and so I don't do a lot of community stuff
 So I'm excited to yeah, it's interesting. We do this. Maybe it's a huge train wreck and this is the only time to happen
 Well, we'll try to make it not a train wreck, right?
 We'll try we'll do our very best
 I think I think one of the big things though that I want to kind of start with and kind of kick this whole thing off is
 Why you spend so much time with podcasting right because like here's the thing man like you're rich
 We all know it right like you don't have to do this right you have this company that you could
 I mean we all learned at funnel hacking live you turned out a billion dollar offer right so clearly you're not doing this for the money
 And you've got a company. You've got a team. You've got all these resources
 You could spend money on ads you can like you could do whatever it is that you want right yet somehow
 You're calling me up and are like dude. I need to do podcasts right and like to somebody who gets it and
 I get it right I have a podcast I dedicate time when it doesn't make sense. I put money into a podcast
 It doesn't make sense right like on paper. I get and I understand content and putting it out there
 But I don't think and I've never been at your level either
 I don't think a lot of people understand
 What like why do you do it dude like why a podcast and why are you investing so much of the time that you have now?
 Which is limited? I'm sure right there's a lot of people trying for your attention why a podcast and why like why is that such a core
 Fundamental piece of that you actually spend so much time on when you clearly don't have to yeah
 Man, there's I could probably in fact, I'll probably give you four or five reasons because it's not just one reason
 There's there's a lot of them
 And I actually I remember like when podcasting started I was at a at arm and more it's big seminar and
 Someone's on stage
 Paul collage is on stage like there's this thing coming
 It's the greatest thing in the world called podcasting and you're gonna put these things your ears and listen to people talk
 I remember I was like that's the stupid thing I've heard no level of snow like I
 And yeah, I just didn't get he's like no
 This is like the future and I remember because I was my roommate at time was Josh Anderson's me as me
 No, Josh and and Josh went by like every podcast domain he could think of and I was like you're done
 Like that's never gonna happen
 But I do remember I was like well if I ever did a podcast like I would call it the mark
 I'd call it the marketing your car podcast was like I could just while I'm gonna cut my dry my car
 I could record it and I remember thinking that I remember I bought at the time marketing your car and I did nothing with it for like
 I don't know eight or nine years just had it in fact
 I even I even paid someone to to write an intro song for it
 So if you ever go back to the first episodes the first hundred something episodes
 There was this really you know at the time it was so cool now
 It's kind of corny, but there's a theme song that some guy wrote for me and I had it for like five years
 It's theme song and I never use it because I was like I still I don't get podcasting
 Then in my business life we had grown up my company at the time we had like a hundred employees and then you know
 The long story as I've heard before is like the company crashed everything fell around and went from a 20,000 square foot
 Office to 2000 square foot office and and like everything I was just like I feel like in idiot
 I was embarrassed like you know my status was an all-time low
 I was weird and
 For some reason in that season of my life. I had this impression like you need to start podcasting
 Hmm and talk about marketing
 I was like this is like I'm like and I was convinced this time
 I was the worst market in the world because I just crashed my entire empire and I was like I'm an idiot like
 You know and so like I didn't want to but I felt this impression like now it's time to start podcast
 So I literally from the ashes of my business started this podcast and I had at time like a four or five minute drive to the office
 I was like okay. I can be consistent with this. It's gonna happen all the time
 I'm gonna do it
 So I got my phone out I click record and I would literally just drive to my office and I would just talk about what we were trying to figure out
 Like all right today
 We're going in the office and I mean you know work on this new offer and this we're thinking and da da da and then you know
 The next step so like oh we launched the offer and it worked or I didn't work so we tried this and it was just me kind of documenting
 It's funny. I heard I heard a
 Vaynerchuk talk about like document your journey and I know that wasn't a thing at the time
 That's literally what I started doing and it was nice because it was something was so easy that I just it was
 Consist it was easy to be consistent with because it was just I think if I if I would have had to do a podcast or for me
 I had a studio on a microphone all the things I probably wouldn't have done it because I wouldn't got enough momentum to stick with it
 But it was easy and at first
 The way we set it up we didn't we couldn't track stats
 So we had no idea if I was listening which was a huge benefit because had I known how few people were listening
 I probably wouldn't have yeah wouldn't have kept doing it
 But I just kept doing it and doing it. I'm not really knowing what kind of return is gonna happen
 You know and it's funny now
 I had someone reach about a year ago go through and start from very getting and listen all the episodes
 I was trying to get like some notes and like try remember and
 It was cool because they started coming back like reporting like did you know on like this day you talked about why you thought
 Anyone who wanted to build a company over ten million dollars in sales was the moron
 You should never try to go a company that big and then over here you talked about
 I'm never gonna hire employee again and like all my thoughts at the time which have morphed and shifted obviously
 But it's like this cool thing where we have this like I have this record now of this journey from the ashes to to click funnels and beyond like
 Okay, it's been very special for me. Okay, sorry. I don't I want to continue down that path
 I want to I want to interject right there. Okay, so
 The reason I started a podcast is because of like literally you told me to right like you didn't physically be like
 I started a podcast like all your books all your content
 You're like publish publish publish publish publish right and I'm like okay
 And so it started on Facebook and start on Facebook lives and then it kind of grew and then my friend Daxie
 He is like dude like turn into a podcast like way more people would listen
 I'm like alright
 so like I
 Have I don't know four five hundred episodes now on my podcast that I've done with you know you and all every all these different
 interviews or whatever
 But what I tell people is and this is true in all areas of my life like
 I'm so blatantly honest on my podcast like I I don't filter or mint my words at all shocking right
 You're filtered on Facebook and Instagram you tell me yeah
 Just a little bit but anyway
 So but like what's interesting is one of the things that you pointed out there was you have this document
 You have this record of exactly where you were at at this time
 Right and so like for me like one of the things and this is bigger than just podcasting like when you're just blatantly honest
 With yourself and like where things are at and you just turn on the microphone and you just talk
 Like you actually can go back and you can watch your progress and you can see like oh man
 Like when I was 26 years old when this happened this is what I thought about life
 right or this is what I thought about you know this particular topic or like this is what I was learning here or
 Like whenever I'm building like a funnel or I'm building you know
 Like something that I knew I worked on in the past and I talked about it
 I can literally go back and I can remember like the struggles and I think it was you it might have been
 It might not been you might have been Gary
 But anyway, someone angers you though you were like imagine if like Jeff Bezos would have documented every single day or like every single
 Week building Amazon like how much people would pay for that right like how that would be so epically cool
 That's like what it's like so I totally understand what you're talking about there
 And I don't think like I feel like people are embarrassed
 Just start a pot like they're like embarrassed where they're at now, right?
 And so they don't want to like put it out there, but I'm like I'll never forget Liz Benny
 You know obviously you know Liz she's amazing right I I had her on my podcast
 This is probably a year and a half ago and she's like Josh
 I've watched you grow so much and I'm like really she's like oh, yeah
 Oh, yeah, I'm like how do you know?
 She's like cuz I listened to your podcast right and it was like oh
 Like this is a long-term thing. It was kind of like at that moment that I realized it you know I mean for sure
 It's interesting because you know if I haven't publicly talked much about this yet, but I've been acquiring old books like I just bought this whole
 Literally like librarian pulling hillbooks and stuff. It's been so fascinating
 So I'm like reading through and these are the records these people and their beliefs and their thoughts and like you know
 I've got old magazines from like early 1900s late 1800s. I'm reading I found an article some Thomas Edison who were in the publishing
 These Matt and it's like I'm reading this stuff. It's so cool
 And one thing that's this is like Russell guilt in the Mormon church one thing
 They always talk about it's like you need to keep it journal you keep it journal
 So that way your posterity has this thing and I've never been good at keeping a journal
 And when I started realizing like as I'm going through all the pulling hill stuff
 I'm like I'm so grateful that they wrote these things down and they have this journal and I start from like guilty getting all sounds like
 Wait a minute. I don't have a journal, but I've been podcasting now for seven years
 I'm like this is my record. This is when I'm dead my kids or my grandkids or my posterity or people who you know
 Whoever it is, you know
 Like this is how they're gonna learn about me and figure out what it was like and hopefully I shortcut them some some
 Tri-home air like here's the journey went on like here's I figured out and I can I can help them and and you know
 I think all of us are always talking about like when I leave an impact like I think you know my podcast episode
 I'm hoping these are my journals. These are my records. This is like what I just bought from Napoleon Hill
 I'm hoping that this becomes something for the future generations
 They could use and they can build their businesses off and their ideas and their plans because my podcast is you know
 Like it's a marketing podcast
 But I don't talk about marketing most of the time talking about my family and my kids and and I'm learning and like my personal development
 And all the things you know, marketing is the hook I got people in but it's it's my life record
 It's my journals, which is kind of cool, too
 Yeah, that's super cool. So like I it's funny we
 Quick side note. We have to shut down this and give them theory because Apple as just spelled different. Yeah, well, that's
 Yeah, we mean we we've tried some things. I'm not sure I'm not trying to push against the biggest company in the world, right?
 So anyway, we have a new name. I'm not gonna say it yet, but like we have it's coming
 But anyway, I like in the last just couple weeks
 I've like had to pause like doing podcasts and like it's weird because like what you said right there is like I don't keep a journal
 But I know that I do keep a journal via like that exact same thing. It was weird. I went to my wife
 Literally two days ago
 I was like I need you to help me create a shit system for the short term to be able to document my thoughts because right now
 I'm not doing it and I have so many things that we're going through right now. So I totally get that but like I feel like
 There's gotta be more than that right? There's gotta be another reason besides just
 Got the documentation process for the podcast for you for sure. Yeah, that's that's the first thing
 Um, again, I got four or five that kind of run me in my head
 So I don't know what the order to come out in but the next one is
 so
 Eventually I wrote a book right and people are like these books are so good
 Like how do you know all these stories and for me? It's like I have an idea
 And the idea percolates my head for a minute and I'm like, I gotta tell someone so usually first person
 I tell is usually the podcast like I think about this thing I talk about right and so like I
 Tell the story the first time the first time I you know
 Maybe that that flushed out they get to the office and I like I see Dave over there Dave's excited
 I'm like, Dave check this out. I tell it to him again and then I tell someone else and then
 I'm doing an interview and I say it again and I tell the story four or five six times
 And I get better and better at telling the story
 When I'm a seminar and I'm on stage and I'm talking I'm talking I'm talking I'm knowing which direction
 I'm going all of a sudden like this thing will pop up my head
 I'm like, oh
 I told that story six times like three months ago and it just appears
 Um, I remember Tony Robbins told me this he said he's like when I go on stage
 I have a plan he's like but the plan like it never goes to plan like
 I start talking and then he's like he's like these downloads just come from from god or from the universe
 And they they just show up and for me as I start podcasting and telling stories over and over and over again
 That's exactly what happens now like when I need
 Something like I'm in a situation. I'm coaching someone I'm talking I'm on a vamp vendor stage or something
 I need something else and that just it appears when I need it
 I think it's because I didn't just think about it forget about it. I think about it
 I tell it on the story. It's published. I tell some else and I and then when I write a book like I told the story 400 times
 Like I know the best way till it's story now
 Right, I've seen like what people laugh at what they don't laugh at like how to do it the right way
 And so it's like in fact, it's interesting like my public or my um my next book is a personal development book
 I struggle with that one because I don't have a personal little podcast and I haven't tested these stories these principles of these theories
 I'm like, huh and like I've been stuck as you know, you're I I so send you the rough draft like eight months ago
 And I have to do something so I think it's part of this. I haven't had a chance to flush these things out
 So it gives me a bit to flush out my ideas is another one. Yeah
 um, another one is interesting. I don't know the exact stats, but I but I um
 I read it somewhere. I think I think I talked about traffic seekers. So I put it in there but
 Conceptually they talked about people who are podcast listeners versus the rest of humanity
 And I'm gonna tell you about stat and I'll tell you how the practical application that stat which is really fascinating
 So the stat was something like the average person since the radio makes like, I don't know $60,000 a year
 And whereas the average podcast listener makes $120,000 a year
 So the people you are getting and acquiring um, they are they are people with more spending power
 They're more affluent people that are the kind of people who are trying to develop their brain their minds there
 Things like that. They're more likely to buy a course or a software or mastermind or things like that because they're kind of people who aren't
 Citizen radio to like to numb themselves
 They're listening to audio to grow and so like that's the fascinating thing that you're getting a better caliber customer who we're listening
 Number two, you are getting them in their most intimate moments like when do you listen to a podcast?
 It's when I'm working out and I'm by myself and it's me and them and I have their full attention
 I'm not listening to podcasts where I'm writing an email or texting someone right where I'm in car driving
 Or I'm in it's like I'm getting access to their brains and their minds in their most intimate moments
 Um, when it's just me and them right even
 Yeah, it's not even like that on youtube either because like youtube I can do video while I'm cooking dinner
 I'm being a cook by other things and that's super interesting
 Like I don't listen to podcasts in my kids in the room because they're gonna ask me a question
 They're gonna mess it up and so it's like it's what I'm separate and it's like just me and them and that's it and so I get this
 I like I have a different level of intimacy with the podcast people I'm listening to so higher quality customers
 Better level of intimacy and then the practical application the first time I really got this
 I was after I launched my inner circle the very first time
 And again, it was funny because
 I always told you I never made my podcast and my inner podcast am I making any money from it
 and um as I
 You know did it for four or five years and I launched my my first virgin manor first version of me inner circle
 We had a point where about 33 people in it paying 25 grand. I remember uh at one of the events
 um
 Somebody asked like how did you guys bump into Russell and all I'm like oh I saw something I saw something because I got on his podcast
 And I listened to him every single day
 I was working out for six months and he got talking about this inner circle and talking about this thing
 He's been getting all these things and it was fascinating that almost everyone in the room
 They didn't hear about my podcast podcast is good for lead gen, right? It's never as you look like
 Yeah, it's horrible for the kids buy ass and grow up your your podcast
 But people find out about you they plug in to your podcast and the people who make that transition from I saw book
 I saw an ad I saw something and they make that transition where they actually get the phone out subscribe and then plug you in
 Like those become your best customers your highest buyers
 They're the best and so the practical application is yes by by doing this podcast. It's like i'm
 I'm taking and I talk about this next word secrets and actually my inner circle meeting last month
 We talked a lot about this like um
 We talk about creating a new opportunity versus an improvement offer right and for the most part you aren't creating new opportunities
 That's what gets people in the door. I told everyone I was like your value ladder should be like this new opportunity
 There's an opportunity stack and I'm like the back of the value ladder
 There's one section that saved for people with ambition right new opportunities all about getting people who have desire to come in
 But uh people with ambition and the percentage of your of your audience is small
 You're the position the percentage of people who have true ambition and maybe 15 to 20
 percent maybe yeah
 Yeah, and uh, but those are your most ambition and I told I told them in my machema. I'm like, I'm like
 I didn't sell you guys new opportunity
 I was like do you want to kind of boy see and talk to them about entrepreneurs or you get better and stronger and smarter like all the er words right?
 Yeah, like you guys are the ones at the top of the value ladder. You are ambitious. So I'm not selling you new opportunity. I'm selling you guys
 um
 Improvement and it's the hardest thing to sell but it's like the the
 You know what what one tier of your audience wants
 I feel like same thing like the people who are listening to your podcast
 These are the people who want improvement. These are the ambitious ones
 They're not the the tire kickers
 And so it's like the best way to convert people into the highest ticket back in things as well
 Yeah, and I also think
 Is one thing that's very important to point out I think here is the style it's such type of podcast that you particular
 Particularly create because I've studied a lot of different podcasts, right?
 Joe Rogan obviously is you know big inspiration of mine when it just comes to creating content or whatever
 But what's interesting is that the type of content that a Joe Rogan creates or that even like a like a Logan Paul
 They're like any of them bigger mainstream podcasts oftentimes it's much more for entertainment
 Right and Joe Rogan. I think it maybe is kind of the blend between the two
 But a lot of podcasts they're not specifically for like solving a very specific problem
 Right and so what I always say about this
 Specifically the type of podcast that you create right you or Steve or whatever is your type of podcast is
 Is horrible for lead generation, but it's amazing for lead education
 Right like it's because once they're in there that you have that and what's interesting is one of the times that I listen to your podcast most
 That I'm gonna let you guess. I'm sure you're not gonna get it
 But what do you think one of the times I listen to your podcast most when you're driving somewhere in your car
 That's a time. Yeah, but it's when I'm in pain, right?
 Like when I have a specific pain around my funnel when I have a specific
 I will literally go and I'm like, oh Russell has this podcast. He's got all these episodes
 I bet you he's talked about it
 And so I'll literally go on my phone and I'll like keyword search like for different things
 And I'll I'll specifically go like there was uh one time I was listening to
 I was something about a webinar or something and you were talking about how you wrote your headlines and basically how you came up with your framework for it
 And I remember I was like I remember you did that one time and so I was struggling with it
 And so I literally searched it and I did it and so like the type of podcast that you create
 There's in my head there's two different ones
 There's one for entertainment and then there's one for education, right?
 And you create one specifically for education and when you do that, that's the that's the type of podcast or that type of content
 That literally goes and educates your your member, right?
 And when you have that like 100 percent my top buyers anybody that gives me
 A top dollar for my stuff that all listen to my podcast or have been on my podcast and I'll you know pull something out of it
 They're all those the ones that pay the most money for sure sure
 Since you're in there's I think she said a lot of formats like when I did mine, I was like
 I did a short form for a couple reasons number one is like it was my drive to the office
 So this kind of started but number two, it's like
 I love Joe Rogan and I probably listened to one of his entire podcast every oh my gosh
 Yeah, I probably listened to a hundred of them and I get overwhelmed because I'm like each one's four hours long
 And there's all these other people I was like oh like everyone keeps talking recently about the jewel
 I'm like it's a crazy word I got listening. I'm like four hours
 I'm like I could get a whole audio book your entire book done in four hours
 I'm like oh is it worth the investment?
 It's like I don't ever want to dive into it because it's so big
 Where's the mine? It's like again something's in the car and like oh like I got I got 10 minute commute boom throw it in
 They get an episode and then what happens is they get hooked and then they'll listen for four hours
 So it's different though because like if Joe Rogans were broken up into even 20 minute blocks
 I would probably listen to you all of them youtube Joe Rogan clips
 It's Joe Rogan's bearings clips and it's literally oh 20 minute episode
 So if you ever want to do this probably I would do you know, I mean
 Yeah, I think it's interesting and also a nice thing about short form is people come in
 They listen and I guess all the time people are like I listened like I got in a podcast listening to four episodes
 And I loved it so I started the very beginning and I binge listened to all of them
 Happens all the time as well where it's like Joe Rogan you're not gonna binge listen
 Because that's like 65 years worth of content
 Mine is just like oh they're sure I'm gonna go to the beginning and they start and then they've gone through your journey with you
 By the time they show up they're like they know everything that you've ever said and they like are so much easier to work with
 They've got that stuff so I think everyone needs like this
 It's one of the things like you're not gonna see a big return on it. I don't initially
 But over time if you're consistent with it like it's it's the best thing and then obviously
 You know, I don't use my platform for this
 But you do and I think it's brilliant as it gives you access to all these people right
 Whereas like the interviewing people like you access people you you can't otherwise
 You literally can't even fad like doors open that you literally can't even understand
 Simply because you're like hey, I have a podcast and hey
 I've got these couple other cool players on here you want to come and like
 Alex her mosey's coming on my podcast, right? Like I literally reached out to him
 I was like I have a podcast and 100 percent. I'm gonna miss i'm to you right now
 I was like hey, I had a podcast and Russell's been on a couple of times you want to come on?
 He's like I love Russell of course I'll come on your show
 Right
 So like like crazy big doors right like that get open simply because you have a platform
 To be able to you know allow someone to use their voice as well. Yep, which is crazy
 Before tonne were super close. We've met a couple times and stuff
 But I remember he was doing a some launch and remember Lewis house and him got on
 Did a big interview and three or four people that interviews I was like so annoying like
 My why I swear to hang out these people not me and now so I had uh the uh, uh, uh,
 Clu's house got a big podcast. I'm like
 Oh my gosh and so I was like, okay
 I need
 I need to be able to offer my platform to him to get in that door and really build that relationship like
 And that's one of the powers of a two you have a platform now
 You've got ability to to access people you can't otherwise and you know as you know
 Yeah, yeah
 Um, all right two rapid fire questions are really quick because I want to move on kind of the next topic to keep us on track
 But number one, well, what's the joe rogan episode that you listened to all the way through?
 Do you remember? Oh, I do know yeah, and I actually hate that I listened this one. Oh, it was the Gary V one
 Uh-oh
 And the reason why I listened because I was like I want to be on joe rogan's podcast someday
 And I want to see what gary talked about because I yeah as you know gary and I have a he probably has no idea
 um
 You have a light beef got an interesting relationship
 Okay, I was like I gotta make sure I'm the next dinner marketer. He actually does a better job
 So okay two things on that one anybody listening. I mean, I'm gonna do this so don't take it
 But I'll beat you to it if you ever can get your Russell runs on joe rogan. That's a great joe
 Dream 100 gift right there, right? Yeah, that would be amazing
 Secondly
 I've listened to so many episodes of of joe rogan one of my favorite ones is actually with connye
 I know everyone thinks conny isn't idiot, but like if you can let it's that's like five hours
 It's insane. It's one of the most intense episodes I've ever listened to but one that is like a must listen to like
 Seriously, one of the best podcast episodes ever done is his first interview with elon musk
 Like if you ever get the chance to sit down and listen to it
 It's like three or three and a half hours, but like like understanding that dude's mind elon musk like you will not regret that three hours
 Of your life. It was a fantastic episode. So that's the one very cool. Okay
 Uh last thing here before we move on are there any other points that we didn't cover about why someone should have a podcast like wrap up
 Make your closing arguments around why someone is as we go to our podcast
 um
 Yeah, the last one will say it I quote nathan berry actually traffic secrets
 And I'll probably mess up the quote, but it was interesting he talked about how
 um, I think the title that I
 The blog post that I shared is like you got to publish long enough you get noticed and he talks about how
 For most of it's so much content out nowadays, right? There's all these things. It's hard to like know what's gonna be good
 Like 5 000 podcast launch days to how many Netflix episodes all sorts of stuff
 It says most of us find out about like so a good show at like season two or season three
 Because as we waited to see like our friends talked about it
 Awesome, it gets a breaking point where i'm talking about it and then and then you become this overnight success, right?
 And he said it's interesting he said you have to publish long enough to get noticed
 And I think that's the biggest thing to understand for especially most people who are getting started and they're like
 So scared like i'm gonna look like an idiot. No one's gonna like they're all gonna make fun
 I'm just beginning to bubble all these different excuses like the good news is they're very beginning
 No one's listening. No it's not
 Doesn't matter
 Just do it. This is your chance to actually find your voice and learn how to speak and tell stories all those kinds of things no one's listening
 And you keep doing it. I keep telling i tell people all the time if you publish consistently for a year
 Doesn't mean like once a month for a year like daily for a year or three four times five times a week
 Consistently for a year two things will happen number one you'll find your voice number two your audience have a chance
 I have a chance to have enough time to actually find you and so it's going out there and just setting it up saying the ROI
 And i'm a big ROI you look at my disc profile my number one values ROI if I can't see the return on investment something
 It's hard for me to do it's why i struggled in school
 So i struggle not for conversations because i'm like what's the point of this i don't get it podcasting it's hard
 Because I didn't know what the ROI was and luckily again, I didn't see the stats for three years
 Had I was like three years. Yeah before we yeah before we figured out how that's crazy stats on it
 And so but because of that because I know what the ROI was i was like just hoping and praying with faith that it would be good
 Now I see the ROI now it's important now. I do it twice a week regardless
 It just happens in the queue in the can because it's that important
 Well, if your number one thing is ROI and you figure out the podcast is worth it guys
 There's your selling point go start a podcast all right on a podcast. Let's go
 It's there honestly it's amazing and it's so much fun too
 You learn so much about yourself and and I think the one thing i'll say about podcasts is you've got to really find your own unique style
 I was listening to I know you know Alex Becker
 But Alex Becker is probably one of the biggest influencers in crypto right now
 Right, I mean just just insane insane right one of my friends got his NFT and he's up like a quarter million bucks in like three months
 Right just insane stuff, but he one of the things he said is right now in the industry
 Everybody is trying to become an influencer right and so he says I see all these people trying to model exactly what it is that I do
 Right and he's like
 I have no problem with you guys doing that because I get it right at the beginning you don't know your voice yet or whatever
 But he's like you'll never be me and I won't use the language that he used right but he's basically like there's only one me
 Right so like eventually like yeah model me do whatever you need to do
 But like eventually like go find your voice like go find your own thing
 Because like that's how people are gonna watch you because like i'm gonna make i'm gonna make sure that you're irrelevant
 If you try to model me long term right and so it's like kind of like giving you that permission to be like yeah
 Like model somebody at the beginning but then like like people
 People are not gonna listen to you if they can go listen to somebody else that has the exact same style
 Right so like it allows you to really be yourself when you give yourself permission to just like try different things and at the beginning
 Like you said no one's listening so yeah, it's funny talking about modeling. I talked about this yesterday on a call i was on but it's fascinating because people
 They they're trying to to copy your model somebody because they're trying to get those people to like to track the right audience right and
 Myron said you don't track who you want you talk to who you are
 And so like if you're trying to use someone else you're you're not gonna like because you want those customers
 It's gonna be weird like I remember we launched click funnels
 I was trying to be like all the other marketing guys because I was competing against you know
 Ryan and parry and traffic diversion so I was like trying to be more a corporatey business
 You kind of like they were and I was like wait a minute. That's not me
 Like i'm not gonna wear a certain tie to on stage. I'm not gonna wear a suit jacket
 I'm gonna wear my t-shirts and jeans and i'm gonna talk about my family and god and wrestling and things i'm excited by and I don't care about
 You know like agency like not they don't care agency
 But I don't care about like like i'm gonna speak to the entrepreneur because that's why
 We're in ryan and parry literally one of the fun or one of their traffic conversions
 We're like, you know, this is less for the entrepreneur for your your teams and your staff and like it's crazy now
 The like I thought we were in the same market
 But since I leaned into who Russell was it's separated and it's not that we're ones better worse
 They're different but like you're a fun-working life. It's my people
 You're in the audience like most of these people here are
 Christians who are athletes who've got kids who are entrepreneurs who not do this for money
 But do it because they want to change the world like that's like the overwhelming percentage of our audience
 Not everyone but as a whole like we attract who we are
 So it's like to lean into that because otherwise you can attract people you don't like and you're gonna hate your life
 And you're gonna hate your business you can hate your customers
 But you you put yourself out there the people who do not resonate with you will leave on their own
 You don't have to kick them out. They make Russell's annoying
 I get you all the time like if I mentioned god on a podcast or I think they're like all right
 I'm out you're talking about god. I'm out sweet. I'm like all right
 Bye like I'm yeah
 You know, I know people like I don't believe in god, but I
 Respect you lean into it and like they're they're they're cool too
 But the people who are offended leave and the people who stick are the ones you want to hang out with anyway
 Because you attract who you are not who you want to to bring you back to talk about that topic
 Super super long what I want to keep moving on to the next piece here
