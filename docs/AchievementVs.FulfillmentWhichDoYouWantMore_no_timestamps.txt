 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast
 I'm sure you some some deep thoughts by Russell Brunson today. I hope you enjoy it and that says keep the theme song
 I'll be right back
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so
 As you guys know last week I was at Lake Powell with my family and we had an amazing relaxing vacation
 Which is really good problem with the entrepreneurial brain
 EPT's entrepreneurial personality types
 When we try to relax we can't and it drives us crazy because we got to be moving forward and minimum momentum, right?
 and so
 Lost in the bow I started thinking about projects and things I want to do things that are fun and like
 You know, I know some of you guys know that I am working on eventually writing my next book
 Which is gonna be the bootstrap book telling click funnel story
 The problem is a click for all stories not done yet
 So I don't know where it's gonna go or how to tell stories
 It's kind of like this thing that's in the back burner that I'm gonna do someday
 It's not a huge rush
 But I'm excited for that but I was like I
 Want something I need something fun to be creating right like I don't know as a creator. I need to create
 I'm sure you guys the same way, right? And and I'm creating this, you know, we have a new two-com club ex coaching program
 Which I'm creating which is a lot of fun, but I'm also being just
 Something that I can enjoy. There's just fun and light-hearted. There's no deadlines or a thing just to create to create, right?
 And so I had an idea
 For a project. I'm not gonna tell you the details and name or anything
 Other than it's it's gonna be the one and only time I ever talk about personal development anyway, right?
 I'm marketing guy. That's what I'm just sick with but
 Obviously, I've had access to a lot of people and most people have access to in this world
 And it's lifetime and had a chance to learn from some amazing people and so I wanted to create this thing
 And I don't know what it's gonna be. I don't know if it's a real book if it's like a book that I'm gonna be just
 Giving away for free is a lead magnet. I have no idea
 but
 I'll tell you the title. I'll tell you the subtitle subtitle is
 The science of achievement the art of fulfillment in very returning Robbins talk he talks about a lot of times
 Like there's two things you got master your master the science of achievement one of this that that had you know the science of how to achieve anything
 alive and then you have to master the art of fulfillment and it's funny because he talks about a lot of times but I always
 Struggle with that personally
 Because it doesn't go deep into the whole thing
 You know and so I'm sitting there at Lake Powell this week thinking about this and I'm sure thinking about the art and the science
 You know and like the science of achievement is lost if I talk about it anyway
 You know, here's the step-by-step. I here's the thing you need to do you do things in this order and you have success
 But the art of fulfillment something I personally struggle with like I'm such an achiever
 I want to achieve this this this and you achieve the I got what's next
 I need to achieve the next thing the next thing that he moving towards, you know running towards this this invisible goal that we don't really know
 What it is and I think a lot of times producers and entrepreneurs and people like me and probably you
 We struggle a lot of times with the art of fulfillment
 Like how do you feel fulfilled and since you get the the art of fulfillment stuff because it's like art
 It's not like the science sciences like here's the things to do to get the thing in arts like this art you get fulfillment
 And I've always struggled and so as I was thinking about the print togethers project
 I started thinking about that. I started just think about the science of achieving because that's where my brain goes
 I'm like, okay, I'm a chipper. How do I achieve like boom? Here's the thing?
 But then I started realizing that like that in the the path of achievement
 The art of fulfillment is almost the opposite. It's like a yin yin yin
 And I started realizing I was like, oh my gosh, I started looking deeper different topics different concepts
 I was like, oh my gosh, this is true in so many things that didn't realize before
 So for example, and this is this is an ample share just kind of help you see when what I'm you know the ah-ha had
 You know everyone talks about morning routines
 Right if you follow any of the fitness guys the health and fitness the biohackers the the entrepreneurs
 They all talk about you got to have more than routine and structure and things like that
 You got to wake up and you got to know I'm gonna do this this this and all these things right
 A lot of times they talk about morning routine starts at night like here's thing to do before we go to bed to increase your sleep patterns
 Then all sort and and that's like very scientific right?
 It's the science of achievement like you want to have more success your create habit you have it's been creating a
 Routine you create the routine you stick the routine you do that thing it creates that outcome and eventually you have success
 Right and I'm a big believer in that actually so I'm not making fun of that by any stretch. It is it is part of the
 The the science of achievement is having that right so if you by the way if you struggle achieving things in the past
 Maybe it's because you don't have that like it's scientific like you just do these things and they outcome it happens
 Like it's just magic right it just it just works
 So there's a science achievement the problem though is is it doesn't create fulfillment right so stick me for a second
 I did a podcast episode about this six months ago or something. I was in I was in
 I was in Puerto Rico with Brandon Bouchard a big match my group bunch of cool people and one of the guys there
 There's got him Craig Clemens and Craig was we're sitting there and he started talking about
 How our brains work? He said you know a lot of times as we get older
 We say oh like the years are getting shorter. I think that time's flying. He said the reality is that's actually true
 So the reason why is because your brain looks for patterns or the same thing happening over and over again that deletes them
 Because it's like I don't even remember this because we do it every single morning
 We do sing every single week every single thing right and so we said he said so literally your brain is deleting those things that keep happening
 And so your life seems shorter because it literally is shorter because those memories
 It's like hey every morning from nine to you know from seven till ten
 It's the same things on your memory
 Because the same thing is delete it and so because that you lose those five hours in your memory every day and so your life goes faster years
 Go faster days go faster weeks go faster and your life goes faster
 He said that the problem is that he's like he's like if you if you want to extend you know extend time
 You have to create and he called them event horizons and you go back and listen that podcast episode
 I talk a lot about him, but it was interesting because he's like this mastermind group
 We're in the very first year we did it
 We all met in Wyoming and we flew helicopters and we shot guns we wrote horses and it was crazy right and he was like that was an event horizon
 He's like I will remember that experience for the rest of my life
 It's like the second year the mastermind came to Puerto Rico and it was amazing where in this new spot
 This new place
 It was amazing is like this is year three and we're in Puerto Rico again
 It's like I'm having an amazing time
 He's like the problem is my is like this experience is so similar to the last one
 Most of it's gonna get deleted from my memory and it's just gonna be gone
 Our brain will just delete it because it's like oh this is routine
 I've done this before it's like you lose that and then I think he was trying to get us to do something crazy at night
 Because he's like we need creating pet horizon right now and he wanted us
 I can't remember that what the thing was but we had it was just some crazy thing to like to stick this in our brain
 So we don't lose this moment of this experience because it's it was so similar to the thing before and
 It's been horizon. I started thinking I'm like oh my gosh like if you think about these two things
 This is the yin in the yang of of fulfillment and happy of yeah
 There are the the science of achievement in the art of fulfillment
 I see yin in the yang because if you want do you want to achieve me want to achieve this thing?
 You need to create structure and routine and have this thing where you just do the things that create the result at the end
 Right as you do that and so because that boom you move it towards you're getting achievement
 Right with promise your brain is to lean the section every single day and all of a sudden your your days are shorter
 Life's or you're not fulfilled you're not getting the art of fulfillment because of that and so the art of fulfillment is the opposite
 It's the literal opposite of this first thing right it is you coming in saying we are not going to do routine
 We have to do these crazy things so it extends our life extends
 That happens we feel fulfillment in the moment and it's this yin in the yang and so that's kind of the thing that I want to explore in this
 In this project is that the personal development sites?
 I think so many times the personal development we focus on one or the other where we have to realize that they're actually all opposites
 And I think so as I'm going through each per principle that that's had a big effect on my life
 I look for the opposite of it. The opposite is like it's funny. It's the thing it this one thing is give me happiness
 It's also thing that didn't give me
 Achievement and vice versa, and it's it's so strange so fascinating. We look at that
 So this is the work. I want to start working on it my free time just for fun is just exploring that writing about it
 So my wife and I were doing we're gonna be picking a topic for each thing and and so this one's gonna be the first yin yang is this
 Personal development versus event horizon since I okay or excuse me the morning routine versus event horizon
 So it's like okay
 We need to create these routines for ourselves and for our kids to be able to achieve a certain things
 What do we want to achieve figure that out the reverse engineer to build a morning routine that helps us to achieve that right?
 So there's your science of achievement, but then sprinkled inside of that we need to have these event horizons that
 That they caused the happiness the art of happiness how we can have the fulfillment or the achievement and the happiness right fulfillment as well
 And it's figuring out the yin yang and the same so anyway, that's a project I'm excited to work on
 But just want to get those that thought in your head because a lot of times the thing you're doing to achieve
 Right and you're killing yourself burning your hustle. You know whatever you're trying to achieve minutes
 It's actually taking away your art of fulfillment
 So how do we go fulfillment in to all these things and so start looking for that as you're looking for these are things
 I'm new to achieve and like what's the exact what's the like?
 Notice this is moving towards achievement
 But it's probably pulling you away from fulfillment away from happiness
 And then like how do I how do I create the yin in the yang inside here?
 So I can get both because if you go one way or the other way you're gonna be a achiever who's miserable or you're gonna be someone
 Who's happy but never accomplished in your life, and I think there's a happy medium between the two
 Because I know for so much of my life
 I've chased achievement and I think part of me keeps chasing and hoping I'll find more happiness there
 It's like no, that's not actually happiness is the achievements there, but happiness is is on the opposite
 So anyway, hope that helps at least get the the will and your head spinning
 I'm excited and hopefully some days turn to a project and maybe won't be maybe this podcast episodes
 All it actually is but I said my plan is is from my wife and I to pick a chapter a topic and then
 Study and learn about both sides of it figure things out create a routine critter or rather rides create something amazing
 And then from that that becomes chapter one the next will pick a next topic and do it and spend time on it
 Figure it out and just keep going so anyway, I'm excited to be fun project and
