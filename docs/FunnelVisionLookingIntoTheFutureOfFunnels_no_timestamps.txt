 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to marketing secrets podcast today
 We are gonna go and I'm gonna give you guys some funnel vision
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey, so I was actually planning on recording the podcast while I was heading to work today
 But I decided to ride my bike two days in a row which is
 Exercise and I also woke up this morning early and wrestled
 Which was actually real exercise good writing a bike pretty easy compared to wrestling
 So yeah, it's like nine in the morning and I'm ready to pass out already spend fun day, but
 What I wanted to share with you guys on my ride today that now I'm sharing to the office
 was
 My thoughts I've been up the last 48 hours like really really excited because I'm always like
 I don't know I excited about like figuring out the next thing and how like where the funnel world's going what tweaks and changes
 We need to make personally and over the last little bit. There's been a lot of stuff that's been changing
 And so it's like gotten me thinking like okay. What's happening? What's needs to change was shifting?
 So one of the big things I'm sure you guys have heard about
 And it's not GDPR. I'm not even talking about that. That's noise me
 So I'm leaving that on the table for now. I'm sure someday we'll talk about it
 but what I'm talking about is
 Google Chrome not auto-playing videos anymore and like what kind of impact is
 That gonna have on your guys businesses? I do think this is actually really important where I think GDPR stupid
 But this is actually important and I think it's actually could be a really really good thing so
 A couple of things we always would auto-play videos like I'm a big big big believer in auto-playing videos
 But after the viral video launch we give it click funnels we split tested
 video auto-playing versus video not auto-playing and
 And then not a play we tested a bunch of different thumbnails to figure out what some know gets people to actually click the button the most and
 What we found is not all videos, but
 If you go right now to click phones.com we and we are shifting it to mother funnel soon
 But you'll notice the video does not auto-playing because that was the test that won that thumbnail with a play button beat out
 Auto-play video, which was so fast and interesting
 So I wouldn't have I wouldn't have assumed that or guess that or I wouldn't have bet money on that a long time ago
 I would have thought that was not the case
 And so that was interesting, but one of the keys could test a bunch of things the key was actually having
 the video
 placeholder image the right image that's clickable actually gets people to click on a button so right now if you don't know
 Google Chrome and other places updated their their things so now all your auto-play videos don't auto-play anymore
 And so I've been going a lot of people's pages and if your video doesn't auto-play it starts on some really weird
 thumbnail that YouTube or whatever video service using just picks and a lot of things is the wrong one
 So I think one of the biggest things you guys can do now is go back to all your pages that have auto-play videos and
 realize if most your customers not auto-playing anymore and then look at the thumbnail and what I recommend doing is what we did with
 the click funnels home pages we went and actually
 John who runs our ads he ran a whole bunch of thumbnail images to see which thumbnail got the highest click-through rate and
 That became the actual thumbnail on the video
 So don't just like put a random thumbnail but I spend some time doing ones testing ones with copy that say click here push play testing
 Things like that because it actually has a huge impact on if people actually click play or not
 You could produce this amazing video that
 Yes, that's the most amazing thing in the world if nobody's clicking play then nobody's actually seeing it anymore
 That's number one number two. I think that copy
 longer-form copies coming back
 in an interesting way
 Because I think nowadays less people watch video especially if they are on your phone
 I think about how both people are probably surfing the internet so when they're taking their bathroom breaks and they're sitting in a stall next to like five other dudes
 Or ladies, I'm sure it's something for you guys
 I have no idea
 But for the dudes like I literally see people in the urinals holding a phone in one hand and holding their business in the other hand and
 It's it's it's horrible. That's in the urinals. I'm not even sure it's happening behind closed doors
 But I guarantee they're not in there just meditating like they're in there reading and surfing and swiping and all sorts of stuff
 But they're not doing with the audio on because they're in a stall next to 22 other dudes in the airport, right? And so
 Just know that's what's happening with your people. That's where they're consuming this stuff
 They're work all day. They're sneaking out and that's when they're looking stuff and so it's hard and harder to watch videos because of that
 It's easier because of their phone
 But it's harder to actually watch it because of just where they're at and how they're interacting with stuff
 And so I think copy is coming back where people need to be able to read stuff
 The next thing in my funnel page these are all whole bunch of predictions of some kind of funnel vision where we going?
 I've been watching Brian Moran who's the owner Sam cart and
 His styling on how he does stuff is so fascinating now all his pages are like single column
 So that they look the same on mobile as they do on desktop and at first I was like why is he excited these huge
 I have three huge monitors on my desk at his page
 It's like this little skinny column like sales letter like this is so weird like but then I realized like it looks the same
 Mobily as it does
 desktop and
 Think how much more powerful if you're designing that way where the experience is the same on both
 as opposed to trying to design and customize and and split test two different things even his order forms are skinny one column things his
 Upsells are skinny one column things and so for me you'll see the next set of funnels
 I come out we're all gonna be very similar style to that because I think it's brilliant
 So Brian if you're listening you're brilliant. There you go. All right, so I think that's the future skinny narrow columns copy-driven
 I just do think there's that I think there's a case for both though. I think having video and copy
 But knowing like a big sense people will never click play if they're not gonna clip play therefore
 What does the copy need to?
 To say to be able to do the whole tire cells process as well
 So there you go the next thing is if you look at automated webinars, you know
 Pre-automated webinars, those guys who haven't been studying your marketing history
 guess what was pre before
 Excuse me before auto webinars what we all did before our webinars were video sales letters Kevin and
 and
 for the most part videos or video sales letters have
 Have definitely gone down in usage as I've watched the click funnels community as more and more people have been focusing webinars and
 Automated webinars to do their sales process
 The problem now is you look at if you look at
 Now that videos don't autoplay if you're an automated webinar we have this issue with click funnels for a week or two
 Because when someone's doing automated webinar, there's like an invisible div over the video file
 Someone can't click to pause the video right that's how technically how this thing actually works
 So what happened though is now no videos are out of playing so someone come to a page
 There's auto webinar and they couldn't push play because there's this invisible div blocking it so that nobody can stop or start
 The thing so it feels like an automated webinar and so for like a week and a half two weeks none of our
 I'm sure you guys probably sell to none of our auto webinars work as
 People the autoplay wouldn't play and they couldn't click on the button and people come this page
 It was just you couldn't do anything
 So we did some hacks and some work rounds for people a lot of webinar funnels to happen
 There's a little pop-up and if you click it to push play and so those things are working now
 But I think they're way less effective now than used to be in fact
 We saw on their software secrets webinar sales drop from last month this month dramatically. It's like what was a big change
 That was a big change
 Auto auto playing versus now some's got a click to auto anyway
 Just it's kind of changes things and I think I think we are going to be experiencing the death of the automated
 Webinar is my gut feeling I think we're gonna be we're gonna be moving backwards in time to a video sales letter style page
 That's my that's my gut reaction is telling me I might be wrong, but I think I'm right
 In fact, you will be seeing a lot of my auto webinar funnels. I'm gonna be rebuilding them as video sales letter style funnels
 But if you look at
 Look how Gora does theirs is really fascinating
 So Gora does video sales letters, but if you leave the video sales letter it exit pops up
 And it says something like hey, you want to read the transcripts instead you say yes and boom it shows a whole long-form
 Sales letter I see another one recently it has a video sales that are underneath it
 There's links as one read the transcripts you click on that and it pops down the full long-form sales letter underneath it
 And so I think I might be wrong, but I think this is the future
 Of where things are going so I'm gonna be working over the next couple weeks
 It's gonna be a mother funnel done and launched and live and out of my hair. I have some big updates and they're making and
 You will see them
 I'll give you a hint so
 Imagine my auto webinar
 What I've been doing is I've been going back through and captioning my entire 90 minute auto webinar
 So captioning the inside the video so if people are watching without the audio they can still read the entire thing
 So which by the way is huge pain in the butt
 Brandon my team did one and it took him like a week my brother Scott soon went right now
 It's taking him like a full week just a huge nightmare to actually caption the whole thing
 But now there's this block black bar in the bottom has an entire 90 minute webinar caption
 Because I'm assuming that a lot of people are listening with it
 You know a couple things one is if they're if they're watching and reading hitting two modalities
 So they're listening they're watching and they're reading actually three modalities
 So you're more likely to get their attention. So we're doing that with our videos number two
 I'm gonna be putting them in an auto webinar. Excuse me video sales letter style page
 I will be having all these videos
 Transcribed and sales letters written in a single column format super long form
 and a couple other cool things so watch it's coming but
 Anyway, those are my predictions. I think that's some of the stuff's happening here in the funnel world that you guys should all be aware of
 Based on autoplay videos based on how people are consuming based on mobile versus desktop
 I don't know if I told you as before but last year was the very first year across the ClickFunnels platform that more traffic
 It was viewed mobile even it was on the desktop
 Which is funny because we all designed for desktop and now it's like why are you designed for towards desktop?
 Less than half or you know more than half of your customers will never see it there
 They're seeing the mobile we should be deciding for the mobile experience not for the desktop experience
 I think that's the future of where things are going and so I think I
 Think some of these examples
 Like Brian rans that I was talking about before I think that
 You look at his examples of his narrow single column pages like that's like he honestly
 I've been messaging on Skype like he gave me permission now to start doing that my stuff because I
 Said that in fact I did a prediction call last December January and I told people
 I think my predictions that we're all gonna start designing mobile first and desktop second and
 But it didn't really impact us as much because just because habits right we keep we keep designing towards
 Desktop and then mobile optimizing after but after seeing Brian's page
 I'm like man, we're not even gonna design a desktop version the desktop version will be the mobile version
 It's interesting if you look at Brandon and Kaitlyn over lady boss weight loss
 It's fascinating to me like I remember the first time I saw the pages
 I was like why is everything on your page centered like all your paragraphs are centered like I was so confused and
 He told me like is none of our people buy down desktop. They all buy a mobile
 He said look at it mobile. I looked at it mobile. I was like oh this page makes sense mobile
 He looks jacked on desktop yet. You look at them and they're building one of the fastest growing companies on our ClickFunnels platform and so
 It's it's
 It's just interesting to see so there's some insights. There's some things
 There's a there's some funnel vision for you guys to look in the future and see what I'm trying to see and
 I'll be making adjustments based on that and feel free to funnel hack and model what I'm doing because I'm doing it with those
 thoughts in mind
 Yeah, so there you go you guys help that helps you guys my diz I hope you guys geek out with me on it because that's what my brains at
 Is some of those things so I'm excited
 That's it you guys so with that said I'm gonna get back to work and get this mother funnel done
 So I can get back to you the new funnels that I want to create that are gonna be so exciting
