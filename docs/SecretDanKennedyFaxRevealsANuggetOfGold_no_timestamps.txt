 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast today
 I want to share with you guys a little it's like 20 words maybe 30 words
 Inside of secret facts. I got from Dan Kennedy while he is only recently acquired his company and so I've been going through the archives
 and there's this facts he said to the old owners and
 I'm not allowed to share the the whole thing because literally on the front page it says
 Let me see what says it says confidential prepared for internal use only anyway
 But there's this one little paragraph that is so cool and
 Probably gonna change some of your guys lives forever. So I don't want to miss it. We're gonna keep things on come back
 I'm gonna tell you what it is. I'm gonna explain it and hopefully this is a little marketing secret you guys can use
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in
 Out to the world and yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Okay, so inside of this fact so this is actually a fact so Bill Glazer who's my first mentor in
 This world like so anyway, so Bill Glazer own magnetic marketing when I was with Bill on my sixth year
 His bachelor my group is when he sold it to this P firm the P firm destroyed the company ran to the ground and then Adam
 Woody bought it from them Adam Whitty got this fax from Dan
 There was basically like this is what is wrong with the business is how they killed it
 Here's how to fix it. Here's what it was supposed to be here's that and kind of it's like almost Dan's business plan for business
 Which is really cool and so then Adam ran it for three years and then we bought it from Adam
 So I think you know so much like golden here. I wish I could I could do a whole event just I'm like
 Oh, here's a fax that Dan sent
 showing how to fix his own business
 From the the PE firms who ran it into the ground
 So many cool things, but okay, I can't give you it all because I'll get in trouble
 But there's the nugget I I'm gonna go on a limb for you guys because this nugget is so cool
 I want you to to understand it and to be able to use it
 And it's interesting because I saw it last week that our all right inner circle meetings and I saw the practical application this again
 Okay, you guys ready for this?
 Get out of patted paper and a pencil if you want to if you want to go deep
 So in this section he titles sections reason for entry versus reasons to stay okay
 And then underneath that says acquisition versus attachment so we're talking about
 Reasons for entries how do you get people into your company right into your community into your world?
 So that acquisition
 Versus reasons to stay and that's attachment so what so how do you get something into your community?
 And then what gets them to actually stay in your community? So those are two different things
 And then the next sentence says not the same not even close
 Okay, a lot of times people think like oh yeah you acquire customer
 They say because they want to keep buying your stuff saying no no no
 Okay acquisition attachment or two different things
 Okay, and what Dan said here is the last time someone reached you from the facts
 He said what brings them in the door initially is almost never what keeps them inside over time
 Okay, we said one time what brings them in the door initially is almost never what keeps them inside over time, okay?
 And so for example
 Most of you guys who are listening this you came in based on some front-end
 Something right some kind of acquisition and so it could have been a lot of things
 I might have been one of my free books
 It could have been you heard me on some podcast it could mean you saw me in an event or you saw a YouTube video or
 There's something right they got you in picture interest and it acquired you got you into my world right acquired
 You as a customer now if you look in fact
 So the very first time I got this is like when we first launched my inner circle as my high ticket at the time is 25 grand
 We signed up. I don't know dozen or so people and it was interesting because people came to me
 They joined the inner circle because they wanted to get closer to me
 They also want to be like yeah, I joined because I wanted to I wanted to learn from you
 But then I was interesting because I watched these people and they stayed year after year after year after year
 In fact we renamed our inner circle
 We call it inner circle for life because it's like when people come in to stay there for life
 Like they're not allowed to leave right after they come in they can't obviously but like
 That's kind of concepts of inner circle for life and so they come in they say year after year after year
 And what's interesting is I noticed that again they came because they want to get to know me
 But then they stayed for something different they stayed for the community they stayed for the other people they stayed for the group
 They stayed for the meeting like they didn't stay for me. It was just Russell
 It was me coming and speaking at them once a year twice a year for the meetings
 They want to stay long term right?
 They stayed because of the community and so what brings them in the door initially is almost never what keeps them inside over time
 And it was interesting because we relaunched the inner circle. I talked about this last couple podcast episodes
 But what was interesting is
 Initially especially in the so we have two two levels now the category Kings and most of category Kings all but two
 I think maybe three had been a minor circle before and so they kind of knew what was happening
 But for the inner circle for life program
 There's almost a hundred people who were brand new again
 There's some people that have been there before but most part they're all new people and they came they joined because they wanted to be in Russell
 Bronson's inner circle they came so wanted to get to know me
 They came so I learned funnels from Russell right so they came in but those facilitate this group and the goal of me facilitating the group
 Is not for Russell again?
 Sage talking the goal was to get them in this room, right?
 It's the room where it happens like the room where the magic happens the room where
 These conversations are happening at higher level and I told them initiatives like Mike like if you guys come here to learn for me
 You can learn from me like or read my books like all the all the stuff's in there
 Like you don't need to like pay me this amount of money to learn from me. I'm like the the power in this room is not me
 It's like I said I'm gonna stand on stage
 My goal is to stimulate conversation and then to like send it back to you guys in these rooms to have these conversations amongst each other
 Like that's the whole thing right so even though that we acquired them the reason for entry
 Right what brought them in the door initially was because they wanted to be in Russell's inner circle be around Russell
 But the reason that they stay is to create attachment
 Right and it's what keeps them inside over time is the relationships the people the community
 And it's just fascinating so if you look at that from you're zooming out you start looking at it's like oh my gosh
 This is the the power you know so many times we think that you know all the weight is on our own shoulders to run these businesses long-term
 Especially information businesses, but they're not it's the community
 And so if you're not building a community if you're not doing things correctly then that becomes the problem, right?
 Then it's like always on you always on you is just this hard thing like why do people he come to fun hockey live?
 The first time to come to fun hockey live fun hockey live because they want to learn like what's the funnel like feel
 Look at the the copy on the page. Usually the headline I
 Replicate from thing to thing is always something tied to
 You know you want fun away, but you don't know which funnels gonna be come fun like I want to show which fun
 That is so that's like the the acquisition gets people in it's like I keep here
 I'll talk about funnels. I so much funnels for me
 So they come for that feel what funnel it is when they come in the room and they have a feeling
 Right they to know other people they become part of the community. They feel the energy like like all those intangibles
 Is why they come back why people come here after year after year? It's why most every other event is happening
 You know in my industry is even smaller and smaller and smaller over year and ours gets bigger and bigger and bigger because
 We acquire people right we bring them in the door initially with the thing that they want and then
 We create attachment inside the community with
 With the thing is gonna keep them over time right coming here rust hearing Russell talk about the next new funnel is not gonna
 Keep them over time. That's boring eventually you're gonna leave right
 But if you build the if you build the reasons for them to stay strong enough
 They'll stay and look you coming over and over and over again the first time ever
 Like saw this in action was interesting the very first time I went to Dan Kennedy seminar
 And I've been studying him and learning about him and like for me was like going to see the guru on the mountain
 I was so excited to go and and
 Journey that direction and get to and to meet him and to see him and all that kind of stuff and I remember
 The the time I saw him he'd just gotten in a he's a he you know Dan if you know anything about him
 He's uh, he has horses and he races horses and stuff and you got injured or something
 So I remember and they told us he's like he made it
 You know first I thought he wasn't gonna come they like he did companies in the wheelchair
 And I remember when he like when he kind of came out
 They wheeled him out and it's just like silence them and no one said of the word and everyone kind of stood up
 And he came in I was just like this is the coolest thing in the world and I remember that feeling of him getting wheeled in here
 And everyone standing and like like the guru has showed up like I was so excited and like that's why I came right?
 And then I remember what he said it was interesting is he he asked the audience
 He's like who here has been following me for more than a year right?
 Ever's had more than five years more than ten more than fifteen more twenty more twenty five more than thirty more than thirty
 And then we have all the back like thirty or forty years
 The camera was and they were still like two dozen people standing with their hands raised of this entire room
 Who've been following him for thirty or forty years?
 And remember he said he kind of laughed and he's like you guys I haven't anything new to say since the 70s
 You know or something like that and he's like so why do you come back?
 And that's we start talking about the reasons why they stay right the attractive character the stories the people the community
 Like these are the reasons why people stay and so if you're just building a
 Company on acquisition where you're bringing people in the problem with that
 You have this company that burns insurance where you're always you know and I had my very first supplement company was a burn insurance people would come in
 We had a really good funnel based on media. We spent a hundred twenty dollars make 180 back
 And it was a good business. We were little cranking through but the supplement
 It didn't get people to stick didn't keep come back and reordering and building key like all these kind of things like they didn't stay
 And so it was always this burn-in-term business and we turn off ads the business stop and that was kind of the the issue and the problem behind it
 And so
 That can be true
 That's true for a lot of people's businesses if you're in a transactional business
 All you're doing is acquisition and if you're in an acquisition profitably, you're okay
 But if you want to like scale your company and grow it where each person goes from being worth whatever hundred hundred eighty bucks to
 You know four or five thousand it's this this mindset shift like you we acquire them one way and then we create attachment a reason for them
 To stay something keeps them inside over time a different way and so hopefully it gets the thoughts you had spinning
 Especially if you've got retention problem, especially if you're losing people especially if you know customers by once from you
 And you never hear me again like this is the reason you're good at the entry
 But you're not good at the reasons for them to stay and so you together as your team or whoever's you're working with think through that
 Ask some questions like why do people stay with us?
 What's the reasons like have we built the culture?
 You know if you if you need to go deeper on that go back to export secrets
 I have three or four chapters talking about building mass movements and what gives people to stay over time, you know
 Like identity and like you know all the things anyway, there's a bunch of stuff that you can learn from there
 But there you go you guys so Dan Kennedy. He's brilliant. There's a fax
 I think that's like what 30 words I gave you, but hopefully it's it's a needle mover
 All right, that's it you guys appreciate you. Thanks for listening. Don't forget the reason for entry is different than the reason
 They stay they're not even and then as Dan said, they're not the same. They're not even close hope to help you guys
