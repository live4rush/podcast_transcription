 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets show excited to be here with you guys today
 And excited to share with you guys what is happening here in quarantine how I'm launching the book and how I'm actually practicing what I preach
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody so if you have been on anybody's channel for the last three weeks
 I am in the middle of the traffic secrets book lunch, which has been so much fun
 And if you don't have your copy of the book yet go to traffic secrets calm
 We are paid for the book you just cover shipping and handling and it is a huge 300 plus page hard-down book
 That is my life's work and it's here and it's available and it's ready for you right now
 We actually ship it on may 5th, but you can get the book and you can order the audio book right now
 It's an upsell we also have a huge box set you can order as an upsell
 Which gives you the brand new updated hardbound.com secrets the brand new updated hardbound expert secrets the new traffic secrets as well as the unlock the secrets workbook
 Which is only available right here right now anyway?
 I want to jump in today because I've been doing interviews like
 anywhere from six to eight or nine a day every single day I'm talking about
 Traffic secrets book and I had some people who were asking like Russell if you're so good at driving traffic then
 Why are you doing these podcast interviews and why are you bla bla bla bla?
 You know how people are so I wanted to take a break from all my interviews to tell you guys why I'm doing this
 And the reason why is because I'm literally practicing what I preach as you read the book
 You'll find out there are more than just one way to drive traffic. We don't destroy on Facebook ads
 There's a lot of things to do and
 In the book I talk about basically there are three types of traffic the first type of traffic is traffic that you control
 Okay, so that's like for example say you get Facebook ads
 I think Mark Zuckerberg owns Facebook he owns all the traffic on Facebook and we can go to him and say like I'm gonna pay you money
 And I want you to I want to control where some of their traffic's going
 I want you to send it to my landing page or to my webinar page wherever we're sending it right
 so percentage of
 Of our ads are gonna be going directly to to where we're pushing it right?
 So that's that's number one traffic we control the second type of traffic is traffic that we earn
 So this is where we're going out we're doing podcast interviews doing Facebook lives or doing stuff
 We're not paying for those ads, but we're earning our way in front of an audience
 And then the goal of both those types of traffic is to convert it into traffic view on which is your own email list
 So that's outside the context of this podcast
 I wanted you to understand a lot of people think traffic is just controlling ads and it's like no
 That's just one piece of it right the other way is adds it that you earns you're working your way in and
 I've shared this a couple times on some of the different podcasts
 But if you think about this think about Hollywood does this Hollywood does this all the time, right?
 So for example right now now we're in quarantine and lockdown with my kids
 We've been doing is we've been watching on the Marvel movies
 So we started chronological orders
 We started with Captain America and then his Captain Marvel and then Iron Man and we've been going through and right now last night
 We just watched Thor the dark the dark world. I think tomorrow. I think tonight we're watching
 Guardians of the Galaxy and they would keep going through it's really really fun
 And what I was excited for is that hopefully quarantine ends about Mayish because in May the next Marvel movies coming out
 Which I'm so excited for for so many reasons one is because I haven't seen a good movie in a long time and number two it's
 It's black widow come on now Scarlett Johansson who doesn't love Scarlett Johansson
 And so we're really excited for that
 But if you start watching how Hollywood promotes this right how Marvel does it a couple things will happen number one is they're going to
 Buy their way and they're gonna go and control traffic, right?
 So what that means is they're gonna go on TV. So NBC CBS, you know like those channels on TV
 They own traffic and Marvel will go and they will buy ads on those things
 So they'll control some of the traffic we can say the movies coming out next week and go and watch it right
 There'll be in front of other movies
 They're gonna buy to be on the on the the previews before movies they buy that spot
 So they're buying their way into like this distribution channel people already the movie theater
 They're already watching the previews and they buy a spot to be one of the previews right?
 So they're buying their way into control traffic
 But then about a week before the big old movie comes out Scarlett Johansson is gonna go out there
 And she's gonna go and she'll hit the the media circuits, right? She will be on
 On today's show the tonight show good morning America
 The Jimmy Fallon show the late night show the I don't even know the shows right all the shows and the radio and the podcast
 And she'll spend like two weeks of her life out there on the road working her way in to all these things
 She's not paying to be on tonight show right she gets she goes on there and she works away
 She goes and she talks she entertains people
 She shows a clip for the movie and she tells people opening nights this week and go to watch it support us
 And if they do it right that all those things together will create this huge launch effect
 Which then we'll get billion you know not billions of millions of people go to movie theater make billion dollars in sales
 And then the movie will live on for a long time
 Okay, and so that's what the hogs were doing and then a lot of times for us is like I'm gonna buy a Facebook ads
 That's the only way that we know how to drive traffic our
 Most people who are driving traffic in the last five or six years become so lazy
 They rely on one thing
 Which is one of the big reasons why the traffic secret book is helping people that I understand how to get traffic from a lot of sources
 How to diversify how to think differently about traffic and so
 And so anyway, I
 Literally practically when I preach right now like I'm doing what Scarlett Johansson was doing when her movie when the movie's coming out
 Right, I'm going out there and I'm doing this I'm out there on the podcast circuit
 So for all of you guys you like we're not be able to get on today show tonight shown CNN all those kind of things
 But there is that equivalent in every market every market has a media circuit right there's podcasts. There are blogs
 There are YouTube channels there are like all these things are already there. So your job is figure out
 how do I work my way in how can I do that and that's what I've been doing
 I've been literally eight hours a day
 You know every day for last three weeks doing this and from there were selling tens of thousands of copies of the book
 You know I'm hitting this one and this one and this one and this one and I'm telling my story
 And I'm and I'm promoting the book that's coming out having get a free copy and I'm just I'm doing the whole circuits
 And so like I said, this is how the whole game is played like I'm doing it
 Hopefully you're doing it, but I get so many times people are just like well
 I don't have I can't buy a Facebook as I can't afford ads
 I can't you know all the different reasons why people can't do something and I just want to like
 Argue for you that you can it's just like you just gotta go create something amazing and then go and do it
 And so there there's my challenge for today
 anyway
 I hope I hope that makes sense to you guys for any of you guys like I
 Don't know it's interesting as I watch people who are in business and like people are in this the state of continual learning
 I think if I was to start a business over from scratch right now like what I would do immediately
 I go create something free like I'd spend an hour tonight
 I just okay what's something sexy and cool I can make for free like a free report free video free something
 It's like just awesome and then I would go immediately and I would first thing I do that would find my dream 100 on the podcast circuits
 I would email him all like hey
 I guys really cool thing
 I just made about how to block and I come talk about your show and I'll give it free for
 For all your audience and I say yes
 I'll go to 20 podcast interviews and I'll go to Facebook who are all the Facebook people and I'll message you know same thing
 And I'll hit all the circuits like that same game that you actually play as well if you're not what are you waiting for?
