 Hey everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast. I've got a special fun treat for you over the next four episodes
 I'm really excited for so we've got a friend lives our neighborhood who
 I just problem when I meet people where I just tell them that they should you know launch businesses and podcast and try to change the world
 because that's just
 How have you the whole world through and we had a chance to meet their family and and I told her I was like you should start a podcast and
 Unlike what most people like here that like oh, yeah, that'd be fun
 She actually did it and share the podcast and and because that one of her first episodes
 I went on I was one of her very first guests, which was which was super cool
 her name is Monica Tanner and her podcast is called on the brighter side and
 So I did the podcast interview with her and she was you know, she kind of jokes that now
 She was nervous was one of her first ones the audio quality wasn't amazing
 But she didn't view with me talking a lot about not so much like my my successes
 Like here's how cool Russell's been more on the failure side and family side and things like that that
 I thought was really interesting. So that was a really fun podcast interview and I'll fast forward like two years later
 She asked my wife to be on the podcast and so Klet did
 A podcast episode with her was kind of like the second half like looking at
 At the same question not the same but similar questions that she asked me but through Klet's lens now she viewed
 The experiences and and what we do and everything of that and so I asked Monica
 She'd be okay with me publishing those four
 Excuse me those two podcasts episodes here on the market secret show and she said yes, so I'm excited for that
 So what we're gonna do is I'm gonna break it up
 Each one into into halves. So basically listening before episode series
 We're just gonna be part one with Russell part two with Russell part three with Klet and part fourth Klet
 Klet's interview just so you know is way better than mine and super proud of her
 She did a great job. It's only her second podcast interview ever and so if you love it let her know
 She's getting more and more used to this and sharing
 Herself and stories and it's just been fun watching her blossom and share these scenes
 I'm grateful for Monica also inviting Klet to be on her podcast as well
 So with that said I'm a cute theme song when we come back. I will start part one of four of on the brighter side
 It's on the brighter side series. So that said let's get started
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that let's us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hello and welcome to on the brighter side
 I'm your host Monica Tanner and today I have a super special treat for you guys
 My guest today is the husband of one of my very best friends in the whole wide world
 The dad of some of my very favorite kids besides my own
 He's our neighbor and friend and one of the kindest men I know over the past 10 years
 He's built a following of over a million entrepreneurs sold hundreds of thousands of copies of his books
 popularized the concept of sales funnels and co-founded a software company called click funnels that helps tens of thousands of
 Entrepreneurs quickly get their message out to the marketplace. Please help me welcome my guest today Russell Brunson. Hi Russell
 Good. Thanks so much for joining us today
 So my first question for you is about your wife
 Because I'm a little person. I know yes because I'm dying to know how a goofy wrestler got a catch like
 Let to marry him like what did you have to do to convince her?
 That was actually it's funny because I'm famous for like selling stuff
 And I was probably the hardest sell I ever had was committed to marry me
 That's awesome
 It's funny because when we first met she's five and a half years older than me and a bunch of them
 My roommates kind of have crushes on her
 So we always go as an apartment go hang out over there because they were all trying to date her and stuff like that
 And I didn't think that that was even impossible
 I just come hanging out and said nothing else to do and after a while
 We just kind of started liking each other and then that was a big question
 I was like can I can I date someone like five half years older to me and I'm like
 Which she actually likes someone by the
 gender
 That was the upside the question and then yeah, she said yes to the first date and then you know it all worked out in
 Okay, so most people who know you know you as a
 fantastically successful businessman a marketer a public speaker and author a guy who can do
 Every and I've been super excited to interviews and
 Strategically place your interview after my episode on failure because I know that you haven't always been this successful
 I know that you've had to overcome some things and even fail at a few other business endeavors before you got to where you are
 So I was hoping you would start by telling us that story
 Yeah, there's actually a lot of stories about my failures
 And I was funny because when I first started my business
 so I was in college and had just married or just met Klet and
 We were about to get married and and it was the first time I remember I told my dad
 I was like hey, I'm getting married and he was like well
 How are you gonna support yourself? And I was like well you've been supporting me and he's like well when you get married
 I don't do that anymore. I'm like oh
 Through that like how you say I mean get married you're your grown man and you're on your own as like okay
 I got to figure out so
 That's what started this whole process
 I started like learning about how to you know internet marketing and how to sell things and try to hold bunch of
 I spent probably about two almost two years trying stuff that didn't work
 So there's a whole slew of failures in there
 But some of the bigger ones were after after I started kind of figuring out like oh, this is how you this is how internet marketing works
 You create a product you set up a website you get people to come to and just kind of learn the basics
 I started making some money and really quick
 I started hiring some people because I've started getting overwhelming so I hired some of my friends and it's funny because
 Anybody who like would ask me a question about I'd hire him because I was like oh you care about this
 Let me hire you I need something to hang out with it would talk to me because no one else knew what I was doing or cared about
 You know and so I'm hiring a bunch of my friends and started growing the company
 And there's this really weird thing is entrepreneurs you make money like when you sell something and that's it
 But as employees you get paid every two weeks whether you make money or not
 And so I started growing this business and they want a paycheck like hey, it's payday
 And I'm like we don't have any money like well
 We have to get paid so I'd be like oh so I go and try to put together something really quick to sell and that pay payroll
 And then like they're out of money again and then I knew payday was like in two weeks again
 So I literally ignore all my staff because I didn't have time to train them on stuff
 I had to go make money so I could pay for them and so they were sitting in the other side of the office like just wondering
 What they should do I was hiding we were trying to make money to pay for them and it was like this horrible thing and
 That was the first time it it was about crews like Christmas time and everything was basically I ran out of money ran out of ideas
 And I was like I have to like fire all my friends and bunch of my family members and which is a scary like just a scary thing
 It's funny. I was out like came Christmas lights up listening to an mp3 of like some somebody telling some business ideas
 And someone had an idea and I was like I could try that so I called them up and like hey guys
 You don't know this yet, but we're completely broke
 I have no money for payroll or Christmas
 But I think I got an idea like you guys want to come try this thing out
 And they were kind of confused and then they all jumped in and we got together
 We put together a new plan and it's funny now
 We'll probably talk about funnels a little bit, but it was a funnel we put together
 We didn't call them that back in the day
 We created this thing and we launched it and we made up money to cover everyone for Christmas
 And it also built like a continuity business so we could actually have money
 Coming in so that was the first time we kind of almost collapsed the business
 But after I kind of figured out like oh this is how it was it was working again
 So we started growing really big and grew the point we had about a hundred and something employees
 And then one day overnight like that whole business with loss of our merchant accounts everything shut down
 He was changing and I had a layoff about 80 people in one day a lot of them are friends and family member
 I'm all my friends some family members as well
 And then over the next like three and a half four years in my life
 It was just like laying off more people and trying to like keep the doors open and just almost going through bankruptcy twice
 I'm almost getting sued by people we owed money to you trying to figure out how to pay him
 It was just it was a really really dark painful two and a half three years or so
 And we would much of my IRS and finally were able to work out of it
 But those are the two and when I think back about the whole thing those are the two biggest times that my business kind of crashed
 And it's funny after after the second the second big crash when I had to laugh all those people
 I had a chance to meet this guy who had made hundreds of millions of dollars like super wealthy
 And he asked me tell my stories
 I told him like the highlight real that most people hear about and he's like well if you ever failed and I was like
 It's like you know
 Reluctantly told him those stories about the failures and he was like okay good you cycled as like what does that mean?
 He's like he's like you cycled it. I'm like okay like what does that mean?
 He said he said he said I'll never work with an entrepreneur hasn't cycled at least once
 He says if if they're always successful, so then they still believe they're on bio
 They still drink their own Kool-Aid. He's after you you've built something and you've lost it all
 Then you cycle it said then then you're humble enough to actually be like to actually be able to work with you to actually create something
 Really really cool to say because you cycle twice as I can actually work with you
 I remember thinking like that sounds so much better than failure
 But it's so true to how true now like a lot of times when I work with people you see the first time they have success
 Like they're going crazy and they're doing much stuff. It's always like they make a lot of decisions a lot of times
 Super arrogant, but like they think it's them and you realize when you do have big failures. It's like oh you're not
 It's not you there's a lot of other people involved and there's you know
 There's there's timing there's inspiration from God and there's people and there's so many things that happen
 And it's like soon as you forget about that those like the Lord humbles you and so ever since the second crash
 I've tried to be super aware of that constantly and I'm not perfect, but very aware of like okay
 Who are all the people that are in charge this?
 What are the inspiration from God that's coming this guided me on these things and trying to be very aware of those because
 I'm just scared that if I'm not aware it's gonna happen again, so anyway
 So what would be your big takeaway? Would you say that it's instead of calling it failure?
 Maybe we we're cycling or I think so and I think people become okay with that like one of the biggest
 problems with entrepreneurs I work with is they're so scared of the potential of crashing that they don't they want
 Riskings or try things and I always tell them like if you look at the founding fathers like they gave us this blessing
 I think it's a gift from God the bankruptcy laws like worst case scenario if you go bankrupt like it's not it's not the end of the world
 Right like it's it's it's it's a gift that we can reset and start over and that's what gives entrepreneurs and people the ability to risk and try things
 Knowing that like worst case scenario. There's a reset you can start over and so I
 Always hope people that like it's not a I don't know
 It's okay to be to know or I think it's okay to fail and to be prepared for it and just when I first started this journey
 I was listening to
 Brian Tracy he was doing an interview
 I was listening to and he said that one night was watching TV and there was this panel like millionaires
 There's like 17 millionaires on this panel and they were interviewing all of them and and one thing's the host ass was like
 How many times did you guys each fail before you're successful and they didn't know the answer
 So they cut the commercial while they counted and they came back and said like I think of the people up there the average
 They'd all failed like on average 14 times before they had their success
 And then Brian Tracy said you think it's that they just got you know
 They failed and they fail and eventually got lucky and they did it or you think it's they failed and they figured like that
 Didn't work and then they failed and they got better and they got better until then she's like they couldn't not be successful
 And I think it's the other way like like the failures are okay
 It's like protecting you from that thing again and you get you closer and closer to to to where you're at
 Like I know that if I were to launch our company ClickFunnels 10 years ago
 I would have bankrupted it four or five times by now, right?
 But all these things I learned going on this journey now. It's like I'm hyper aware of like okay
 There's a gap here. There's a way I can fail here
 There's things that are happening and I'm able to protect myself because of that because of the the failures
 I feel like the failures are preparing you for whatever your bigger mission is someday
 I love that so much so my question is free personally like after that second crash where it was you were so close to the bottom
 Why not just get a regular job somewhere working for someone like what gave you the idea and the courage to start from just to do it over again?
 I actually remember
 vividly remember laying in bed one day thinking
 I wish that I had a boss so he could fire me because it was like I wanted like I would have loved to like step away from that
 For me the circumstances of the whole crash
 I wasn't able to I had a bookkeeper who didn't pay
 I didn't know it's the time hadn't paid payroll taxes in over a year
 And then we had sold a whole bunch of coaching
 So we had a bunch of students who had bought stuff that we had outstanding liabilities to and so I woke up every morning for
 A two-year period of time knowing that if I don't pay the IRS back and pay
 I don't know this the time that payroll taxes is not like they could give you a fine like payroll taxes
 They lock you up and you go to jail
 So I was like if I don't figure out to pay the IRS stuff
 I go to jail which is like really scary thing to think through right and saying these like I had I had sold
 I'd sold stuff people and I had to keep fulfilling on it
 And if I didn't fulfill it I would it would have destroyed my name and my reputation
 I would have lost that forever too, which is like so if I go to jail or I lose my reputation or both
 I was like I can't quit even if I wanted to so for me that give it those are the two things are really
 The driving forces that kept me in it, but then it's like I don't know and I but you could have just quit
 I mean you could have just said take me to jail. I don't care about my reputation
 I'm gonna get a 9 to 5 or like this is too much stress
 Yeah, I guess you could have but I don't know there's something I grew up as a wrestler
 And I just know that like all the all the good stuff in wrestling came on the back of like defeat like my junior year in high school
 I was gonna be a I thought I was gonna be a state champ my very first match
 I lost it
 But like that loss the person I lost to like my dad filmed that match and we wouldn't watch the thousand times over
 And then the state finals actually rest on the same guy and and beating in the finals
 And then I looked like all my big successes like you know all American all those things
 They all came on the back of like a bunch of failures
 It was like okay, here's the mistakes here's the problems just focus on that like what are the tweaks and the changes
 We got to make to come back and do better next time
 And for me it's more like that like as painful as it was and how much I just wanted to give up
 It was more like okay
 What's the what are the change we saw work before like I'd seen it before I had seen you know come to the hundred people
 Generates a lot of revenue and helps a lot of people
 So I was able to I was able to see the fruits of it and I got loved that part of it
 And I think part of me I missed that part
 I was like hey, we just got to we just got to figure out how to get back to there
 We're there once we just got to figure out the model and how to change it and tweak it and luckily for us eventually we figured it out again
 So do you credit wrestling with that resilience that just kept you in there and in the game and going and working hard?
 100% yeah, I think most athletes that I know do really good in other things in life business
 Not all of them some of them are dumb. I think a lot of friends who are like you know train wrecks
 But for me 100% like it wrestling and sports together
 Teach you so much stuff right because most people in their life
 They don't do sports like they don't ever fail like they they are the thing where they're studying their learning they could test
 They get us, you know, they get their grade and they just they're those kind of things
 But they don't have a chance to fail where more most sports
 Especially wrestling for me because you know typical wrestling season you have 30 to 40 matches and off season you got another 80
 She took 100 matches a year
 So most people don't win 100 matches a year like you lose tons of those right and so many of us that way
 I lost so many times and and I think losing such a good thing because you learn either you give up and you walk away and you throw your
 Hands in or you're like, okay, I got to beat that for me
 It's like especially when wrestling is like you see the person you know who they are and like you know next week
 They're gonna be the same tournament again like I got to beat this guy next week and make you so frustrated
 So you like watch the match figure out what they're doing and then practice all we can see me again
 You try again and they beat you again you come back and you keep doing it until you know to the end so it helps a lot
 I'm starting to understand your drive here
 So I talk a lot on my blog and my podcast about finding your life's purpose
 So what do you think is your life's purpose and does it include making a whole bunch of millionaires?
 I love making millionaires. That is fun. Good at it
 Yeah, in our office now
 We have a I don't see you see our two common couple words, right?
 so we have like this hallway was the bathroom hallway and
 Everyone that makes a million dollars side click phones gets a big plaque and now both sides of the hallway floor is ceiling or field
 Now the kitchen is completely filled to and we've got maybe I don't know maybe 30 to 40 days before like we have no more room in our
 Office to hang up these plaques for one so no, but for me to be honest
 I didn't know for a long time when my mission was at all like I just I was excited by this like business and sales and marketing got me
 Excited, but I was kind of shallow like what's the point of all this?
 I don't know
 But I was learning it and it was excited so I kept doing it and honestly wasn't probably till about a year ago
 I think I really
 Started getting clarity on my vision was I had a really good coach in Terry Williams
 I was working with at the time and she just asked me
 She did you see the parallels like what you're doing and I was like no just try to make money
 And she's like she's like do you need more money?
 I'm like no she's like then why do you keep doing this?
 I was like because I start telling like stories that people might okay like I'll write a couple quick stories that are fun
 Like one is there's a girl named Annie Grace that works with us who she beat alcohol addiction
 She couldn't do it through 12 step programs
 She found one way to do it
 She written books about it and the year ago
 She came to our program and she's like I want to help change the world and she didn't know how to do it
 I was like well
 I don't know how to help people alcohol addiction
 But I know I get your message out to a bunch of people so we gave her some tools and some training and she's helped
 In the last 12 months over 50,000 women are not moving people to overcome alcohol addiction
 She's got him Chris Speats cancer.com who got the death sentence like 27 20 year old that he had cancer and decided not to chemotherapy
 And thought you know, can I cure myself? I don't know if she started going trying to cure herself and eventually cures herself naturally
 And decided I need to get this message out to people
 And so we've been able to help give him tools and systems to get that out
 And he's helped tens of thousands of people naturally cure themselves of cancer
 Pamela Wiebel helps doctors commit suicide
 She said thousands of doctors from from suicide through our tools and our training and like I just look at all these people who have
 Who have gifts? I don't have like I can't I can't help a doctor not commit suicide or I can't someone lose weight
 I can't I don't know those things
 But I have because of like what I've done I've learned how to like get someone whatever their business their product
 That shivers out to get some more people and so for me like I really feel like that's my mission
 I was like how do I how do I empower entrepreneurs to actually change the world?
 And so ever since then ever so I kind of got that like I become like hyper obsessed with entrepreneurs and how can I help them?
 How can I give them the tools the inspiration?
 Whatever it is because I'm a huge believer that entrepreneurs only people that can actually change the world
 I don't think politicians are gonna do it. I don't think government's gonna do it
 Like I see entrepreneurs who are like obsessively compassionate about like their their thing they figured out
 That's who changes the world and so for me
 It's just like if I can if I can empower each of them then then that's my mission to help them be able to change their world
 So that's kind of my thoughts. I think that's awesome
 I love it so much and I love watching you work
 So I've seen you speak at some live events and I know you get up there and you command a room with thousands of people in it
 But I also know you personally and socially I know you as really shy and reserved. I know you're not
 But I know you'd rather hang out in the corner and observe than be out like work in the room
 Which was which is what people would think if they see you at these live events
 So which of these personalities comes more naturally to you like what's the real Russell?
 I'm a hundred percent awkward weird kid. No, it's funny cuz like two months ago
 I spoke in a bed that nine thousand people in the room and I was on stage
 I just like loved every second
 I was so much fun and then afterwards I was in the hallway and someone came to talk asked me a question and
 One guy's a works in the day Woodward. He told me he's like if you see your body language like you're on stage
 And your body's just like excited and something's up to you
 You're like like scared to death and like and I think for sure that's definitely like more
 Naturally my whole life. I was awkward nervous growing up. I didn't have a ton of friends
 It's like the one thing I had growing up was wrestling like that was my thing
 So I was friends the wrestlers
 But like spending my 20 year high school unions this year and like they're looking to listen to her was coming
 I didn't know anyone who's coming like none the wrestlers show up and I know anybody I'm like how do I not know anybody my
 Like I didn't know anybody I wasn't friends to anyone I went on a mission for our church and I was awkward nervous there
 In fact, I reconnected with my mission president recently and he told me he came to our last event
 He was like I had never in a million years would have pegged you to be the one who be on stage to do that
 I'm like, oh, but it was funny because I remember consciously when I made that decision to try to figure that out
 I'd been selling things online behind the computer and I was comfortable there and I liked it and I went to my very first internet marketing seminar
 It was Atlanta, Georgia
 This guy named arm and morn who put it on and I remember I wanted to go because I didn't know anybody else who was doing
 I was doing and I felt lonely and entrepreneurship
 I think a lot of times is lonely because you share up you you share ideas of people and they used to look at you like oh
 Wow, good luck with that
 You know what I mean the rice glaze over and and so I didn't have anyone to talk to you about this whole thing
 And so I knew that there was a this event and all these entrepreneurs gonna come so I'm gonna come and just I can be with my people
 I was so excited so I went there and I remember I don't know how events were ran back then and
 Back then the way that they were a lot of people called pitch fest where like every speaker comes and they sell something
 I didn't know that's what it was
 I come in this event the first speaker gets on stage and he talks for like 90 minutes then if he sells something and I was
 So confused I guys like what is he selling something?
 I just couldn't understand what's happening
 But I saw I was selling two thousand dollar thing and all the people jumping up running to the back of the room
 I remember looking back doing the math and I was like 2004 6 8 10 I'm like that gave me like 80 thousand dollars in
 In an hour and I and then the next speaker gets up and he was selling the five thousand our package and he sold it
 And the people were in back as in the math and he did like a hundred and fifty thousand and I watched just for three days
 Speaker after speaker and by the end I was like I
 Have to learn how to do that like if someone can stand on a stage and in an hour make more money
 I made an entire year or some people in entire lifetime like I have to learn that that art and how that works
 And it's funny cuz I it didn't come naturally like I someone invited me to speak in the seminars
 I went the first time and it's so embarrassing. I had a shaved head back then in glasses and I was wearing suit and tags
 I thought that's how you know
 You have you for a business person and I went and I ship on stage and and I was super nervous and awkward
 I tried to sell something nobody bought and I was like I will never do this again
 And I didn't for a long time
 But then I kept seeing this happen other events and I see stuff
 And I was like this is skills that I have to learn and so on my end up spending the next and almost ten years of my life
 Like doing that about two and a half three years
 I was I was flying around the country speaking at events trying to learn the art event trying to get comfortable doing it
 So scary and then about two and a half years in
 It's after we had the twins were born and I remember I was at the Boise airport one night like 11 30 at night
 I was only when the airport I was just miserable and like a flying somewhere else to go speak
 I just wanted to be home and I remember texting collect and I was like hey, I'm I'm retiring
 I'm gonna be done with this and she's like you can't that's how we make our money
 I'm like I know but I'll figure out some other way but I'm done so we I basically quit
 Speaking and I went and like how to replicate this on the internet
 And so we started doing teleseminars back then and then webinars and that became how we kind of did stuff
 But I you know I went out my comfort zone to learn it and became comfortable with it now
 You know I teach thousands of entrepreneurs how to how to do that
 How to either do it on a webinar or on a teleseminar or on stage and I think that having your own platform is the best
 It's the best way to get your message out there and be able to actually change people's lives
 It's hard to do it if you're gonna be the awkward introverted person
 So for me I had to come out of that to be able to actually have the impact I really wanted
 But it's still yeah, I mean you go to church and you know how I'm like this shy guy
 I decided that in my last war the last church nobody knew what I did no whatever asked
 It was kind of nice and so I was fine and this war like someone found out and they told people and now
 Now would you last week questions?
 So like I'm dying to know because it doesn't come naturally to you
 I know that because I know you but is there something that you like do you have to like mentally prepare somehow?
 Do you say something to yourself or like how do you just prep yourself to go so far out of your comfort zone?
 I mean you like play the rocky soundtrack in your mind like
 It's funny cuz I still get super nervous every time and people always say how do you get nervous like you do this all the time?
 I'm like I don't know but I it was the same way wrestling even I was wrestling someone who wasn't good
 I would still get butter like insane butterflies and nervousness and like all that stuff as soon as I was step on the mat and shake
 Their hand soon you shook the hand like instantly disappear and you're like in the zone and for me
 It's the same way like I get so nervous
 I think the biggest thing I found is as funny one of my one of my
 Friends when my employees caught me the other day. You know I do this
 but I always before I go find somewhere to go pray and
 And basically I just pray that like I will be able to have the thoughts in my head to be able to actually inspire people to do what I
 But they need to do and that's like the biggest company to me is just praying understanding
 It's not me like I think a lot of times we nervous cuz like this is us and it's like we're putting us on trial
 I think and like me they're not gonna like me that freaks us out and I think over the last few years I come to realization
 Like my job is not to care people like me. It's like can I actually have the impact and change this person and so that's that's become more important to me
 So I was praying for that and that gives me that helps call my nerves
 But then it's just it's still scary I get out there and it's like even the smaller ones
 We're just like smaller right so nervous and anxiety and then soon they introduce me come out
 I see everybody that's like it goes away because I'm like these people I can serve I can help and it's just so much so much fun
 That's so cool
