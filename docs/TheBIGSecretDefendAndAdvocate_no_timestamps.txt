 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing seekers podcast today
 We're gonna talk about one of the most powerful strategies. I've ever heard to
 Grow your following build your herd and actually change the lives of the people you are serving
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 Hey everyone, all right
 so I'm actually in my inner circle room right now walking around in circles and
 I'm reminiscing on the last couple weeks ahead all my hundred entrepreneurs in the inner circle come out and spend time with me
 And what's cool about it is everyone has a chance to get up on our little stage here and talk about their business and things
 They're working and they have a chance to ask questions
 And it's my favorite way to learn it's I think it's better than a product any book any course anything
 And it's how I learned the best and so I sit here in this room with these amazing entrepreneurs and learn and get ideas from them
 And in our last set of meetings, I got something that was so good and I wanted to share with you
 So a lot of you guys know Alex Sharpen he's spoken on a fun life and I have twice
 He's one of the coaches in our two comical bags coaching program and I had a chance to start working with Alex last summer
 He is with moving into this new business where we try to become a you know
 Who he is right now and I'm fighting to a mastermind group
 We were doing in Las Vegas at Pirates Cove if you watch our funnel hacker TV online
 You probably saw the three or four episodes at Pirates Cove last year
 Which is really fun and anyway
 He was kind of struggling and I gave his my days and pointed in the right direction
 And I told him to launch a podcast do a webinar and I've watched this his business has blown up over the last little bit
 Which has been really fun and then also it's been fun watching him serve so many people. Yeah, I think
 My superpowers getting people from wherever they're at
 Getting to a million dollars in record amount of time. Like I don't think there's anybody on planet Earth that has
 created more first generation self-made millionaires than us here at ClickFunnels
 I'd be shocked if anyone else has done that and if so
 We will pass them very very soon because we were pumping out millionaires every single day
 Which is really fun and Alex the superpowers and helping them to build teams and scale
 which is cool and so he's been helping a lot of the people in our inner circle and
 Just within our community and now inside the two comical bags coaching program. He's teaching that division of it
 Which is here's how to build a team and scale and grow and all that kind of stuff. So
 Anyway, it's exciting and anyway, we're sitting here
 We're talking everything we're sharing some stuff. He said something that was like oh like I stopped like
 I met I had everyone stop like did you guys just hear what he said cuz he had a say in passing and then left
 He said that what you need to do as a publisher someone who's out there
 Talking and building content all sorts of stuff like that is you have to defend and advocate for your
 Avatar your prospect your customer your people right
 Defend and advocate and we said that he kind of went through it and kept talking and I was like whoa slow to have like
 Like freak it out
 And what's cool is like I watch
 Like I understand now what like some of the stuff he does and it like just opened my mind this huge thing
 So he serves entrepreneurs right because he's got a podcast is really good called the momentum podcast
 He's got his book called the entrepreneur personality type like he's talking to entrepreneurs all the time
 And if you watch him, he does such a good job of this and it's cool because I knew he was doing it
 But I know that he was conscious of him doing it and now I know these conscious of doing it
 Like it's even cooler cuz now is your pattern and when you understand the pattern you can actually like do something about it
 So what he does he defends entrepreneurs right like you're not wrong. You're okay
 You're not different like just cuz you're different as me you're broken like you're like it's a superpower
 He's defending his people which are entrepreneurs and then he advocates for them like
 We haven't talked about the like
 Like why aren't your ships great and why you're special and like boom boom on and on and on so he defends and he advocates for
 his dream customer and what happens when you're defending and you're advocating for those people those people come to you
 Because you are the protector and the promoter of them like
 It's not amazing
 So for all of you guys like and I've been talking a lot about a lot in in recently
 It's just like if you stop thinking about businesses like what product am I selling start thinking more about who what's the customer?
 That I am serving and you get super hyper folks on this is the customer
 I'm gonna serve the best of my ability and then the question is like how do I defend and
 advocate for this person so they feel protection and they
 With within you what you're doing and after you know that then it's like okay
 Now I have a direction for all my outbound content for all my Facebook lives my videos my podcast
 My everything is you are defending and advocating for your avatar for your dream customer
 And when you're defending and you're advocating those people will be attracted to you
 They will come to you and then you can serve them and you can change their life. I was like oh my gosh
 This is amazing think about like as a parent right I have these kids and I love my kids
 They are amazing and like my goal my one of my roles as their father is to defend them to protect them right defend them and
 Then advocate talk about amazing they are okay, and
 And that's like what you do as a parent as you do is a spouse as you do is like in whatever it is
 And it's like if you're doing that for your customer
 First off your customers will come to you second off
 They will share the message and bring others to you as well
 Okay, and I think that that's one of the biggest reasons why Alex has blown up you know
 He came to the Pirates Club mastermind. I was like hey dude
 You should do a podcast he's like oh everyone told me I should do a podcast
 I'm like well everyone's dumb and they're wrong do a podcast and so he's like I'm doing it
 And what he did then is he used that podcast that platform to defend and advocate for his dream customers who are entrepreneurs
 Because of that they came and they come in in in great numbers
 He was showing his his podcast download stats in last eight months since he launched in it's huge
 Okay, I've done this but not knowingly right now that I'm aware of it you can better like
 Like believe me you'll see now that I'm aware of the pattern that I will now amplify it like crazy
 I'll be focusing more on defending and advocating on my my customers my dream customers now that I'm aware of the pattern
 Like I don't know how if you guys are like me
 But it's like I try to identify patterns because as soon as you see the pattern then you can amplify and magnify the thing
 That the pattern is doing so it's like this the faster the better
 And so for me, I'm gonna start doing that
 So for you now that you're aware of the pattern now you've got what you need to go and start doing it
 So figure out become intimate with who is your dream customer and figure out how can I defend and advocate for them and then publish like crazy
 Now I want to share one other thing that was so cool
 So we have our partner meeting this week
 So Todd and Ryan flew out here and we just had you know fun chance to meet and talk about a bunch of cool things
 and
 John who runs all of our traffic
 He he pulled it some stats to share with us and was like basically showing in last six months how much traffic has grown and he was showing
 The stat and I still remember so let me rewind back back when we were focused on like we were email marketers completely
 Enough I can how we did everything before social media things blew up like I remember I was sending email to my list
 If we got 5,000 clicks, I was like that was a good email for 10,000 clicks
 I was like that's insane right the 10,000 clicks from email was like
 Amazingly like that was amazing. So if I could send 10,000 clicks to an offer to a page
 That was like insanely good, right now
 I wanted to give you give you that see of contrast of what I'm about share with you
 So John showed us his graph of how much our traffic stats and views and listeners and so he showed like you know on Instagram
 on Facebook on Twitter on our podcast on everything how much stuff's happening how fast is grown and then he had this little chart here on the
 chart he showed like the percentage of our daily
 interactions with our dream customers and show this whole thing and they had this little number underneath the numbers like
 274,000 something I was like oh is that how many
 Is that how many like interactions we had with our customers in the last month?
 Okay, and he said no I'm like oh
 Like what what was the timeline he said that's how much we're averaging per day
 It's like what the upper day
 Like there's there's no way that doesn't make any sense and so he showed me numbers. Okay. Here's the podcast. Okay. The podcast gets I
 Don't remember the number 15,000 listens a day, right? So boom there's 15,000 there then here's Facebook
 On our Facebook ads. We're getting you have the views right so views like least 10 seconds
 It's like people watch 10 seconds. There's there's like 30,000 data happened there and then you got Instagram Instagram
 I get I don't know
 6 or 7,000 views per story. I do like 15 or 20 stories a day
 Then you do Twitter and our blog posts and our dick all these things and ends up being like 200 like
 More than a quarter million people a day
 interacting with the content we're putting out
 Is that insane and I'm looking at people friends
 I've had that the news for a decade who were just slowly to write on emails and they're sending email and trying to get you know
 1,000 or 10,000 clicks on the email going out and I'm like they're missing it like that
 Email's still powerful, but man imagine right now click funnels as a company
 250 plus thousand people a day are interacting with pieces of content we're putting out there like that is power
 That's where we're gonna go now if you're doing that and you're putting out all this stuff
 And your job is defending advocating and a quarter million people of a day are seeing it
 Imagine how you grow your brand your company your culture and everything grows. So anyway
 I hope it helps you guys the base
 I wanted to take away is defend and advocate next thing what you take away is like you guys need to be publishing because
 Now is the cheapest and the easiest has been in the history of the world to get your message out to people and I think that
 I think it'll get harder. I don't think it's gonna get easier
 I think it'll be more platforms think I think attention will get segmented
 But man if you can control that much attention every single day
 Like now is the time to dive in and do it right build up your podcast relationship build up your following on Facebook
 Build up your Twitter build up your Instagram like do those things because man like again my my old business trying to get 10,000 clicks
 And you know an email three or four times a week versus now
 250,000 people a day interacting with me whether I do anything or you know without me doing too much
 It's it's crazy. It's insane. So I think as you go out there and you defend and you advocate for your dream clients
 Those numbers will amplify they will share you know Alex hasn't done paid ads to grow his podcast
 But he's defended out of caters people and people share it
 Because there's people know other people just like them and that's the magic. That's the power
 So become a defender and an advocate of your dream customer of your avatar
 Give them a place where they feel protection in a place where you can share their message and as you do that
 They will come to you the whole if you build it. They will come
 In this situation is actually true. So hope that helps you guys appreciate you all go to defend and advocate for your people
 They need you and as you do that you will change their lives
