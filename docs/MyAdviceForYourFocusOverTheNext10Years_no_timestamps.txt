 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast since last we hung out
 I've had a birthday. I'm now 40. I'm an old old old. I'm not that old
 but I'm an older man than I was last time I hung out and I said to be here and
 One of my super favorite people on earth asked me a question and so today's episode is gonna be me answering that question
 So that said this cute theme song and we'll come back here in a few seconds
 So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own
 pockets
 How do we mark it in a way that let's us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so
 So me has no one of my favorite people in this whole funnel hacking community is Rachel Peterson and she walks me this morning asking me a question
 I thought was really good. So I'm gonna
 respond to her through podcast because that's how work you can respond to one person or you can respond through podcast and
 You respond to a whole bunch of people. So hopefully this helps everybody Rachel. You're amazing. Thanks for the question and
 Here we go. So now that you're 40 if you go back to 30 year old you, what would you tell yourself?
 I'm 30 and I'm kind of excited because I have a decade a decade
 Can I surpass that you've done in 10 years? Not probably not but at the same time
 I'd love to give it a try. What would you tell me at 30 versus?
 What would you tell you at 30 if you could go back in time? All right, so
 to answer your question Rachel and everybody who's listening in
 It's interesting because
 We just go through different different phases, right? And so the way I answer this may be just because the phase I'm in right now
 If I just interesting when my dad turned 60, I remember we we celebrated up it
 These these trailers that we my parents have and my mom sat down and she had $10 for each decade
 He was live so gave him $60 and each $10 should give him he would talk about that decade of his life
 like you know from zero to ten and ten to twenty twenty thirty and like each of the different phases and I
 Still remember the thing that was most profound to me. He said that the favorite decade he had so far was the one where he was
 Like 40 to 50, which is when he was coaching me and my brother's wrestling
 So that was of all the decades his favorite
 I was like interesting because I thought my favorite decade would be the one where I'm in the arena like when I was actually
 Wrestling, you know or doing my thing
 And so that was kind of interesting to hear that and and then it's also interesting
 Last week going to Tony Robbins had his 60th birthday party and so we had a chance to go there and see
 It kind of reflection on his life and what he did and I don't know if I told you as an op-it
 He raised
 18 million dollars for OUR his birthday party, which was so cool. So
 Anyway, so it's just kind of a fun time to reflect and
 Looking back now, it's like okay. I'm 40. I've got the next decade till I'm 15 then one till six
 I got the two more decades
 To be where Tony's at and just like I don't like what I wanted to say what I want to do different like what are all the things?
 And it's interesting because I would say the last 10 years specifically the last five
 For me has been this grind to create and to make to build click funnels and to write three books and to do all the things
 we're doing and
 And I think that there's a season for all entrepreneurs where where that's
 What you do right where you're in the in the thick of it and for me that's been the season
 I've been in for the last you know more than a decade now is in isn't the grind and the hustle and the you know all those kind of things and
 As I'm transitioning now to 40s in this next you know decade or whatever the reflective period
 You know it's interesting because I'm trying to think more strategically and
 And start thinking about like what are the things that I actually enjoy the most it was interesting
 I've had a chance this year quite a few times to hang out with Jenna future and and
 Jenna was really good at like
 Or is really good at like saying this is what I want my life to look like and then building all the things around them
 and
 And I think I was always kind of afraid of that because I was like no
 I got if I do that then I'm not gonna be able to have the impact and service made people's I want all these things right
 I can set I need to you know I gotta be the guy I gotta build the things that I gotta I gotta you know
 Build the the Empire the dynasty whatever but it's interesting
 Two weeks ago. I was hanging out Jenna and we're sitting there and she's there with her and her team of you know
 her small team of people and and and you know they just won the the KVV launch like outsole everybody by two to one or more
 I just killed it she has his podcast is killing it and she spends tons of time at home with her kids and with her kid with her husband
 traveling and and
 And it's interesting because like as I look at the through the lens
 I'm like I end to what she has now because she's been able to do it at a huge level without sacrificing
 All the other things around her and I asked her about that look like how have you done that and
 It was interesting she told me
 You know she's like I got for me
 She's like I value the most is freedom
 So she's like I could have got an office and I could have got staffed
 they just then would feel like I had it going to the office and had to had to do all these things and and
 and
 It was just interesting because
 She was able to do you know similar what I've been trying to do
 but I thought to be able to do I had to have all these things the office and the staff and the people and
 And looking back now like what what are like the things actually enjoy the most right?
 I think this is a better theme for me for the last probably six months or so
 maybe a year just looking like what are the things I enjoy the most because now that I'm in this role in the business
 I do a lot of things I don't enjoy as much I'm trying to transition out and shifting around and and
 I keep thinking like let's say this quick funnel's journey for me was done
 Like what would what would I do next and I really think what I would do next I would look at like what is my my superpower into business right?
 Like the thing that I get excited by and I geek out on the thing that I love the most and it's the funnel piece right like I love
 Brains from the funnel designing it creating it optimizing it like all the things
 But I don't like I'm not good at like after the funnel is live like I'm not good at long-term customer support and maintenance and driving traffic
 and like all those things are not really my strong suit. I get excited by the art of it, but then not the long-term maintenance of it and
 And so it's like for me like that's like that's my favorite part
 It's like could I could I have the same impact I'm having now?
 maybe even a bigger level where I just do that piece of it and
 We're joking. This is probably inappropriate. So cover the ears of your children if they're listening to podcast right now
 but we're joking how
 like it's the same thing with a
 Man, I don't know if I should go down the shore, but here we are so
 like being a parent right like there's one piece of
 Of your parenting journey that is pure
 Like amazingness right it doesn't last long. It's you know depending on who you are
 It's a few minutes to maybe an hour of
 like 100% enjoyment in the parenting right and then that that moment's over and then it's like you transition to
 to the
 Like the rest of it right when now it's like now, you know
 We have to go through nine months of pregnancy in the way to give birth and then we have to
 Feed the baby and help it and then teach it how to walk and then how to talk and then how to go to school and then
 They become teenagers they start hating you for the most ridiculous reasons
 Like the fact that you feed them every day and you help them and you and your only goal is to make them
 Survive this life and not be bad people and they hate you for it
 And then yes, as you can tell I have a teenager now, so I'm starting to feel that face of it
 You know I mean and so it's it's um
 It's it's all the different it's all the things right?
 It's like you know this one piece of like pure
 enjoyment followed by 18 years of of
 Effort and struggle and trial and hardships right it's not true. There's definitely peaks of happiness in between
 but it's like it's like it's it's hard like there's a one piece of of of
 Having a kid that's like the best right and then I was talking about it in business the same thing
 I for me like that is building the funnels like oh we had built the funnel and this is amazing experience and
 Then it's like then it's over. It's like oh now we've got to care for the baby
 We got to do customer support and we've got to maintain it
 We've got to drive traffic and we got to make sure it's legally compliant
 And we got it you know and like in the longer you run the more updates you got to make and then you get more
 And you're getting more ads and it's like all these things are just like I don't I don't necessarily love that part of it
 But some people do right like John Parks my team like he like that's the best part for him like he like
 For him the most exciting thing is not building the funnels like some hands in the funnel it converts
 It's like oh I can go drive traffic. It's like oh, that's where he gets his his the best part for him, right?
 That's
 I'm trying to do so up so that was that same words would offend little kids. I'm too many young listeners now
 Anyway, you guys you know what I'm talking about right first comes love them comes marriage like the baby the baby care
 So it's like
 It's it's it's that piece of it, right? And so
 But everyone that piece is different right they all everyone enjoys different parts of it. I
 Guess that also the metaphor relates anyway
 I won't keep running on that metaphor, but you get up same
 And so for me
 It's like looking this next chapter by life
 I'm like is there is there a way that I can come in and just do the part that I love the most and
 Not to do all the other things and it's hard like when I'm the business owner like I'm responsible for so many things where it's like
 And I think for so long in my life
 I want I needed the ego of like I want to be the business owner
 I need to see you I need to be the boss and say I don't know if that's necessarily what I
 What I would the next decade I want to do like I would rather come into companies and be like him
 Let me do my magic trick
 I'm gonna have my my one-night stand that I'm out and and then I'm gonna hand it back to you
 As in you're in charge now of raising the baby and making sure it turns into a good human being
 but I'm
 Should we call this episode like the one nice stand marketing?
 That's horrible, but that's kind of what it is like I figure out like what is what is the one piece?
 In a very ethical moral good way that you love and then going to companies and just applying your art there, right?
 And then and I'm not having to worry about the other things that take away the excitement and happiness and the thrill for you
 So I would say from my advice looking back now
 Is there's definitely a season
 Where all of us have to grind and hustle and like learn the skill set right?
 I spent the last decade mastering my my art and now I know what I'm good at it. I think the next decade is gonna be less of me
 Trying to build huge companies and more of me
 Using my my skill set to come in and to do my do my my piece of it and then and then leave and so how does that gonna look?
 I don't know yet
 I have ideas and those things will will hopefully
 You know start being seen over the next couple years, but I think for all you guys
 I would say the same kind of thing is like don't don't stress so much about
 Making your your weaknesses become strengths instead like double down on your strengths become really good at them
 Then go for your work where can you apply your strengths for the most leverage like coming to somebody and saying hey
 I'm really good at traffic. Let me do the traffic for you. I want to be I want to be partnered in this thing or I
 Will really get the funnel I'm really good at copywriting. I just copywriter who at the time was like one of the best copywriters ever
 This is our company was kind of struggling and I offered him
 I said I'll give you 20% of my company if you write copy for me for
 For for free
 Not for free. I said I paid per project
 But it's gonna be not gonna be like your your high-end thing
 But they just basically cost that you can survive and 20% of the company and he told me no
 Told me no, I messaged him that as I just you know had you said yes to that deal
 Your monthly paycheck would be and I told him and he was like throwing up in his mouth
 But he had the opportunity right to take his skills up the superpower he had and apply it to something
 Where he could have just written and then went back to bed and I would have done the rest of the stuff
 Right, I would have built the funnels out of the stuff and he got paid insane amounts the rest of his life
 Right there's some people who are the best in the world to support some people to best in the world
 Whatever I think for me it's like spend spend the the next
 Whatever three to five ten years becoming the best in the world at your thing like wherever you're standing out
 Like straight them there become the best there and then after that's done
 then
 Then go and like take that superpower and go apply to other places
 I think you know right now for most you guys you're in your testing ground where you're learning the stuff and you're doing it for the very first time
 So it's like become the best in the world that become the best
 Podcast that appear the best support person the best traffic best Facebook the best designer best
 Whatever it is the piece that you love the most and just spend the next year two years like deeking out becoming the best in the world at it
 And then take that skill set and go plug into
 Into opportunities where you can come in do your magic power and step back out and you're not tied down to the long term
 All the pieces of it you can tie in and get equity tie in and get royalties
 whatever that thing might be but
 It gives you the ability to stay with 100% focus on what you love and not have to get tied down in the parts that you don't love and
 Man, I wish that I I wish I would have done that earlier because
 I'm not gonna lie the last the last ten years to build a lot
 I am worn out and I'm tired
 But it was also my training grant to be able to come the best in the world when I do now, right?
 And now I can go and I can I can I can ask where I can get those kind of deals
 as often as I want so
 Anyway, that's like I hope that helps maybe it it maybe it
 So we're watching Billy Madison the day my wife and I on it was on TV somewhere, so maybe it's like
 Billy Madison he gives the answer at the end. He's like nowhere in any of your incoherent babbling
 Did you come even close to a rational thought the audience is all now dumber for having heard this?
 That's how you get started out. It's so I apologize, but if not
 Hopefully hopefully got some value of I think the biggest thing again is like wherever you are now
 Like don't dab like become the best in the world at it
 spend this next season doing that and then and then
 From there you've got super power you can plug in and you can amplify other people superpowers
 And that's a chance to go in get out
 Do you want to stand do the thing you love the most and then and then profit from it for for the long term?
 So all right, that's why I gotta say I'm about to go film the docums secrets new sales video and then we're doing in like five hours
