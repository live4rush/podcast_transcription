 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast I got a question for you
 Are you currently buying dead businesses if not get list in this episode?
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answer
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, I'm not gonna lie I'm having so much fun on some side projects
 Which kind of goes against everything that I preach if you've been a minor circle
 Even my coaching programs always help people like focus on one thing and you got to kill other babies
 And so I understand that being a total hypocrite by doing this and talking about this
 But alas my 80dness needed an outlet and so this is my outlet
 It was either this or like go watch the show on Netflix. I'm like alright
 I'm just gonna do this instead so listen with caution, but hopefully it gets you as excited so
 During covid all sorts of chaos happen
 but same time there were a lot of really good businesses that went out of business because
 Honestly the entrepreneurs who are running them don't know how to run funnels like that's literally
 That's literally it
 And now that you recently have iOS updates and the all the all the fighting between Apple and Facebook and stuff
 The games getting harder and guess what the people who are good at funnels are the ones who are winning like that's it
 Because the people who are really good funnels can spend more to acquire customer and everybody else
 And so if you haven't mastered the funnel game yet like you have to learn it or else
 You're not gonna survive like you know and luckily for my funnel hackers
 I've been teaching and training you guys for a long time and most you guys are rock stars and you get it
 Therefore you haven't success
 But you know for those who aren't like they're gonna be out of business soon and that it leads to a really interesting really cool
 Really fun opportunity for people like us where we can take our funnel building skills
 Look at cool businesses that once were profitable that no longer are because the the market changed and they weren't able to shift
 And you can come in and you can do some really cool things with it
 So I'm gonna give you guys a couple case to the market
 I need details on anyone because I don't know more live live yet
 But they're all close to live and they're exciting
 so there was one supplement company that was I was really excited by and I was a customer for a long time and then they went out of business and
 I started buying that supplements products because their sales video is so good right
 Went out of business and then thanks three or four years like I'm messaging the old owner like why did you take it down?
 He's like ah, we you know they had the reasons and I was like I want to buy it. I want to buy it and
 Finally this year is able to negotiate
 To buy the entire company for a fraction what they spent on just the sales video back in the day
 And now we're about we're like two weeks away from relaunching that brand and that company which is so exciting
 We literally just took it took the same formulas tweet it a little bit
 Took the sales videos good build out a funnel and now we've got this new asset
 That's literally we just can turn ads on and and it'll print money for the rest of my life until we sell it or something
 But it's exciting
 the other thing is another supplement I was taking that was one of my favorite supplements and then during COVID it stopped coming and I
 messaged the owners and I go supply chain management issues
 We had to shut down and I was like I love this company
 I want to bring the brand back if I if I help finance it can then we bring it back and we figured out a deal
 And now I'm an owner that company and and that's about to launch as well
 And then another there was this really cool t-shirt company that used to love it was so exciting
 And then the other day went to buy a t-shirt from him and the site was down. I was like what?
 And so I went I found the site I found the owners
 I was like dude you guys wide site down like always shut it down and and so I made an offer and I bought it for
 Insanely low price and we bought the entire t-shirt company, which is exciting and that's rolling out soon
 But there are millions like literally millions of deals like this out there and so me as my like well
 I don't know how to find him
 I don't know how to look for my I would start opening your eyes like there's so many of these deals out there
 We can take them put a funnel on them and boom you're back in business
 And there's there's tons in fact one of the ways I used to do this back in the day
 It's been a while since I did this but I used to go to Clickbank and Clickbank has their marketplace and
 The marketplace is interesting because they rank things based on what's selling the most right so like page one
 You see those ones number one seller number two number three all the way down to ten
 But what I would do is I would go to like page 99 and you go back there and there's some amazing offers that one time
 We're amazing but for every reason the person
 Stop driving traffic to it. They may have done a product launch. It's something. It's just sitting there and it's basically dead
 And I can't do you how many of those old offers I'd go to like this the copies good the funnels good the products good
 I messaged you on or like hey, what's happening this product like oh, you know
 Our Facebook account got shut down or hey
 I did the initial launch and then we just don't have any traffic
 You know like they don't have a Facebook answer a million different reasons why right?
 Or maybe they just had if there's no upsell no downsell so Facebook ads didn't work
 And it's like they just need an upsell like they just applied some funnel techniques to be good
 Or hey
 We could plug a challenge funnel in front of this thing and that's the product we sell the back of it and products great
 And I'd find these things way deep buried in Clickbank's marketplace message the people and then come back to them
 Like hey, can I you would number one can I buy it from you?
 Which is gonna be more expensive to buy the domain the brand all that kind of stuff or number two is like
 I don't want to actually buy this from you can I license it from you and then you may be like
 What's licensing means like well basically I'm gonna license the sales that I'm gonna license the product and license all the things and a lot
 Time just really really cheap to license it all and then you create your own brand out of it
 And I've had literally like dozens of deals like that where I spent less than a thousand dollars to license somebody's entire
 Business and product I got the I got the e-book. I got the course
 I got the sales that I got everything for a thousand bucks
 I'm something they probably spent 20 grand launching five years earlier and it's still good
 It just needs to be polished needs to be plugged into a funnel needs some traffic and use an upsell needs down
 So he's like it's something but that's it and there's so many opportunities and deals like that out there
 I think most of us are forgetting or missing so start looking like what are the businesses out there that are struggling?
 What businesses have been shut down what things are used to buy that you can no longer can buy
 Could you buy the company could you license the product?
 Could you become a reseller like could you apply your funnel knowledge to it?
 I've seen tons of people who got out there taking really good products that are selling in one way and they go and license it and then plug
 Into a funnel and they have they own all the online distribution or the funnel distribution
 Right they find authors who are selling books on Amazon and have no funnel and they come and they build the funnel for them
 And then they give a royalty back to the author, but then they own the thing right?
 There's so many ways to make money in this game. It's anyway
 I've got my ADD dab a little bit some of these fun things and I guess they've got two supplement brands and t-shirt
 That are all launching from my ADD this which is so much fun. So I guess that's better than watching Netflix
 Anyway, so I just want to shut you guys because maybe you'll get the wheels and you had spinny
 So we have to have businesses yet. Maybe like I get the funnel game. I'm actually business yet. Well cool
 There's a couple ways to go start a business from scratch really really inexpensively really quickly and and
 In a way where you're gonna do all the product development or the copy or all these things that maybe you're not as good at
 You can find those things that are already finished that are done that are out there like I bet you 50 bucks
 In fact, I know this for like if you go to flip a dot com fli ppa.com. There's hundreds of websites that are for sale
 also Shopify has
 Has an exchange I think it's called Shopify exchange or something if you go to Google if I've been Shopify stores for sale
 It'll pull up. It's a marketplace tons of you left Shopify stores
 They're selling them and like I literally almost bought four or five of them last weekend
 I was going through them all like oh my gosh like one was a one was like
 Kind of dollar-shave club
 It was like shaving stuff. It's like really cool shaving stuff and there's also like a beard club with all these beard things
 I'm like well
 I don't have a beard
 But how cool if I like bought a beard company and a shaving company I own a both and they were like super cheap and
 Basically these guys create the brand create the logos create the products launched
 It didn't know how to like actually drive traffic or sells and all the stuff's done all the hard work's finished the suppliers
 Manufacturers the logos the design that everything's done
 They just have a Shopify store which is you guys know is not gonna make you nearly as much money as a funnel
 I was like I'm just gonna buy the Shopify store plug it in you know plug the offers into a funnel
 And boom we're out to the races
 And these are all skill sets you guys have been learning here inside of our community
 If you've been learning a funnel hacking live which you don't ever take it yet
 We're like 30 days away from the event go to funnel hacking live dot com, but there's that right there's
 There's
 The books right if you're a dot com secrets book
 You know I do funnels like if you go to one funnel way challenge like even in
 Incorporating into our community if you're learning the skill sets and he's gonna grab something and apply it to it
 And it's literally there's like the the principles universal
 Right any product and there's tons of out there and you can start plugging it in so that you can go
 You can create your own courses, which is an amazing way
 You can go and get stuff off all the bobber Shopify or excuse me like from China or you can find people already did
 Why put together this store who did all the hard work?
 They still don't have to sell it you can grab it structure into funnel and boom this off the races
 I literally like my team
 I send probably 30 of the Shopify stores I wanted to buy it all would have been like a cool little business
 I could be making I don't know who knows five ten grand a month just on autopilot
 By us just like literally taking the products plugging into a funnel getting an agency to drive Facebook ads to it
 And then it just sends me money every single month like how fun is that how cool is that?
 You're just getting this this is what I'm talking about. This is why this game is so much fun
 It's why I still can't sleep at night because this funnel game is it's expansive is always growing it's so much fun
 and
 Anyway, I hope you guys are half-s excited as I am my goal is to keep you guys excited because this game is the best game
 That's ever been played and you guys have a chance to play at a level that nobody else in the history of all times
 I've been able to do back in the day people had like by mailing list and and
 Postage stamps all sorts of stuff where you guys can literally just get a clickfunk account
 Throw some things up buy some Facebook ads and you're in the game like that's it so much fun anyway
 I'm gonna I'm gonna go. I just wanted to kind of brand up on you guys while I was having fun
 Thanks so much for listening. Hopefully it gets the wheels here spinning
 I recommend go to flippa.com look for what's for sale go to
 Clickbank and scroll deep in the marketplace to the forgotten offers and go find a forgotten offer there and see if you can buy it from
 Where you can license it from them go to Google type and Shopify stores for sale and again
 There's something it's I can't remember the name
 But it's like a Shopify exchange that has all these Shopify store owners for people who did the whole thing
 Figured it out got all the hard work done and couldn't figure out make money with it now
 They're listening for sale you can buy it
 So many cool ways some of the fun things you can do. I hope this helps
