 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing secrets podcast. I got special treat for you guys today
 So it's not my two-com club ex group
 We've got some amazing entrepreneurs and one of the people who signed up this year was Justin Garini who is
 the dude who was on the first season American Idol and
 He took second place at Kelly Clarkson and then he was in the movie Justin Kelly and then it was called
 And then now he's the dr. Pepper spokesman a bunch of other cool things
 He's a super awesome guy and he kind of jumped into our community recently and then came from knocking live
 and joined the coaching program and he just launched his very first funnel and
 Anyway, it's fun watching him like geek out and anyway
 Just it's super cool and anyway today he posted his fun with live or actually a couple days ago
 This fun was live
 but he's having and then today he posted basically like his ads aren't working yet he's kind of not sure what to do in a little
 Frustrated and super positive still but just kind of like it's not working yet and
 And so today I just did a really quick Facebook live into two comical ex groups specifically to him
 But to everybody and I thought it was really good and some really important things for you guys as well
 So I'm gonna just post that Facebook live here and so you guys can listen to it about 20 minutes long and
 The whole theme of it is what do you do?
 While you're waiting for your paid ads to work. So if you've been ever stuck in that situation
 Hopefully this episode will help you out a lot. So thanks so much and I'll keep the theme song we come back
 I'll go directly into that Facebook live. Thanks everybody
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey, what's up everybody this Russell again
 Hope you guys are amazing. I know this is me going live twice in like six hours, but
 When I'm on a roll I'm on a roll right notice can I
 Last night I went live and kind of talked to you about some of the cool things I'm planning and thinking about for 2ccx
 And then this morning I woke up and I was going through my feed and I saw the post
 Adjustment about his funnel going live and the app not working yet and him being frustrated and and you know
 And his post is really really good. Hopefully he has all had a chance to read it
 But I started sitting here this morning as I was taking my kids to the office
 I was like okay if I was just sitting here became an officer like what would I tell him would be the very first thing?
 And so I had an idea and I thought was really cool and I want to share with you guys
 So I hope you don't mind
 It's okay if I just go live real quick today my inner circle meeting start here in like 30 minutes
 And I thought I would just take a moment out and and share this I think it'll be helpful for a lot of you guys
 Especially I know a lot of you guys who are in this coaching program
 You're here on a budget and you try to figure things out
 And so you spend all the time and the effort and energy right going and creating the funnel and the offer and getting it live
 And then you and then like you do all the work behind that right which takes time
 Especially the very first time out the gate the very first time you go and you do all the the work and the effort to to create it right
 And and so you you spend the time the energy the effort you get the offer done the hook the story the copy all the stuff the funnel
 You're like okay now it has to work and you're nervous
 Like what if it doesn't work and you put it like everything into it and then you go and you put it Facebook ads and Facebook ads are like
 Or like the greatest and the worst thing at all right because you like you go right the ad and you go
 You submit it and approve and put your money and all that kind of stuff that you wait
 And then like something happens like that they add gets to support or you spend a hundred dollars and nobody buys anything
 You spend a thousand dollars nobody buys anything and you're like ah and you're like
 I don't even know what to do now
 Like do I do I stop the ad do I change the funnel do I change the offer was the offer bad
 I screw the whole thing up like and all this fear starts coming right and
 And that's where a lot of you get to and then you're like I don't know what to do
 And then you're like I'm out or I'm gonna bail or I'm gonna like I'm gonna want to lean in like girls keep saying
 But I don't know what to lean into like what do I do like where do I shift like and and that's kind of where a lot of you guys are at
 and that's what Justin kind of posted yesterday or maybe it was this morning and
 First off only know that I feel for you
 I know that pain and that frustration and that fear and all those things that go into it and you're like man
 I spent three months building this like I don't even know what to change or what to right and there's that fear and so
 I wanted to step back and kind of give give you guys some some advice and hopefully some hope and belief because it's
 Definitely the piece that's needed right here in the journey and so
 What I would say is first off
 It's interesting not this fun like you might have a two-fennel hockey lives ago my my keynote intro presentation
 I talked about the different phases of the business right from going zero to a million million to ten ten to a hundred
 And the whole thing between going from zero to a million is by far the hardest phase. I think
 There's also most exciting like I love the start of phase. That's why I love the coaching because I love that piece of it
 But what's interesting is going from zero to a million the biggest thing you have to figure out
 There's two there's two questions to figure out number one's like what am I selling like what and it's not like
 What do I want to sell it?
 What does the market actually want right?
 So that's the first thing and the second thing is like how do I sell so the what and how I was talking about like what am I selling and
 How do I how am I selling that and so?
 Part of the what is initially is kind of a guess like okay? I'm guessing this is it
 I'm gonna maybe this is it and you put out then you just hope that it's the thing and sometimes you like nail
 By the head it's like boom the market is like that's what I want
 They freak out it's really good other times put out there in the market doesn't really want it or not very many people and that's okay
 Don't get discouraged
 You know for me it took a whole bunch of what's before I hit click funnels right like 14 years of what's but what's cool
 About is each of these different what's you putting out there?
 Kind of incremental success where you're growing a list customers are buying more people
 You know you can create the next thing and the next thing and and they all kind of build upon each other
 Tell like boom something something hits and so don't freak out the very first thing you put out there
 It doesn't have to be your million dollar winner
 It's just the the act of getting out there because the very first thing you put out is the hardest because you have to learn
 All the steps like have to learn how to build a funnel and drive copy and do a hook and an offer and write create a product
 And do an e-cover and put it like all the things right and I always tell people to you know
 my very first product I ever created was a software product called zip-brander and
 You know looking at zip-brander as a as a whole was a complete failure
 I think I probably sold 200 copies max
 You know but at the same time it was the biggest success that I've had because it was the first time
 I did the whole process from A to Z where I bought the domain got graphics design row copy created a product started driving traffic
 Made a few sales like and and even though it wasn't like my million dollar thing
 It was like I did the process once and sometimes like oh this is easy
 I already know when we get in for copy who didn't design and like the the next part became really very easy
 Right and every funnel after that and I kept doing funnel after funnel after funnel until like until we started having some some big successes
 So first thing is just the fact you got the first thing done. That's that's huge
 So that's the one the second is how like how like what am I selling and how am I selling it?
 So that's the second question is how do I sell like ideally like that the end goal is like I want to have Facebook ads
 I can scale I can just spend a thousand dollars a day and I make five thousand a day and like just rolling right
 So that's where I'll try to get to but the reality is and I want to step back for a minute because the reality is is paid ads
 Well, that's the holy grail. That's what we're trying to get to
 It's always not it's not always the first thing
 In fact, I didn't do paid ads in my business for the first decade
 Which is crazy 10 years of my business before I ever like paid for that
 And so it's interesting because nowadays we always leave like go to go to paid ads
 The reason why is because like as soon as you get paid ads to work
 It's the holy grail and like life becomes super easy, right?
 But it's not always the easiest thing at first especially right now where you like you create the off
 You put the time and effort energy in and then like oh you go and you pay for the ad and then like it didn't work
 And then you're like, oh, what do I do and you tweak the ad and you wait again another day and especially for us entrepreneurs
 You're like our momentum driven right?
 We're trying we're moving like like the momentum is what kids is going like running Facebook ads when they're not working at first
 It's like the opposite momentum. It's like girl
 You hit it like this brick wall I put it behind me like you boom you hit a brick wall and like oh and then you change
 Yeah, and you try again
 It's like oh hit brick wall and it's like you lose this momentum
 It's like this huge letdown right and so just I felt that I was reading your postage
 Just like oh like I did the work the effort the ads are working
 And I need the momentum to keep me excited and motivated and like but the momentum is gone because the ads not working
 And I don't know what I changed the offer the landing page to the ad like all these things right
 So what I want to do is I want to step back because if I was looking at like traffic strategies like if I started a new business
 The first thing I probably wouldn't do is Facebook and not I should say it right
 I would start Facebook ads initially because like I want to get that working as fast as possible
 So I wouldn't give up on that I would keep doing that making the tweaks and the changes
 But during that process while waiting for your ads to hit where I'm waiting for me to work while you're waiting for the slowness of like
 That initial grind while you're waiting for things to hit you don't want to stop momentum, right?
 You want to keep momentum going all right?
 You're gonna it's gonna be frustrating. So for me. It's like what would I do if I was if I was starting over right now
 Let's say I put together a book or an offer or a landing page or whatever and I need I need traffic coming
 Waiting for Facebook ads to do to work. What would I do right now?
 And so for me what I would be doing right now is I would be going old school
 In fact, it's funny. I'm writing the traffic seekers book right now, and I literally last week worked on this chapter
 But it all comes down to the dream 100
 So what's the concept of the dream 100 dream 100 or who are the hundred people that already have your dream clients on?
 It right
 Who are those people and then how do I get from their audiences for free?
 And in the book I talk about those two ways to get into the dream 100 number one is you buy your way in right?
 And number two is you work your way in and so what I would do and I if I was to do this today is
 I would start with
 Podcasts let me like podcast is the channel I would I would choose initially so I'm gonna say a couple things
 And I'll wrap it into a bow that may it will make more sense, but I would I would start with the channel of podcasting
 Because obviously Facebook and Instagram with YouTube we have all these things
 But podcasting is by far the channel I would lead with and the reason why is podcast listeners are the best buyers
 These are my dream audience. They are reason why I wrote my own podcast is reason why I go on other people's podcast
 Podcast listeners are the best buyers by far. Okay, I read a study and I'm gonna script the numbers
 But it was like the average human who listens to the radio makes like thirty thousand dollars a year and the average human who listens to podcasts
 Makes over a hundred thousand dollars a year. I just buy the fact that they have the podcast app on their phone and they are listening to content
 Makes them a better. I don't want to say that's rude to say
 But doesn't make them a better human you can be a good human and listen music all day
 But they make them a better buyer better consumer
 They make more money on average and they're just they're they're into development. They're into learning anyway
 So they're like they're your dream customers. So what I do is I say, okay?
 I'm gonna I'm gonna focus on the podcast channel and you think about
 To give it any movie right like when Avengers Endgame came out which by the way was that like the most insane movie all time?
 So good anyway, what happened watch the roll out what happened is that they went basically and they built their dream 100 for them
 It was TV shows right so it's like okay
 Who are all the shows and then obviously Marvel Studios was buying ads right they were on Facebook?
 They were on YouTube. They were on TV. They were buying ads for their show
 But then they sent all of their their attractive characters out to go and and work their way in right?
 They were on Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel and the Today Show and Good Morning America and they were out there doing the circuit right
 Getting the free traffic so they're out doing the free stuff while Marvel is doing the paid ads
 So while you're trying to get your paid ads to work
 You should be doing the same thing is going out there and working your way and getting into the circuit
 So I would go to the iTunes directory at any podcast directory
 I would go look through the top 100 in every category
 So okay of of all these different podcasts who were the who are the people that already have like my dream customers listening to this podcast and
 It doesn't have to be like oh like for me. I wouldn't say it just people in the business the business
 Category look at business personal development. I would look at different categories
 Because again podcast listeners are all I mean if they're listening to podcast in a personal development
 Which means they're into all sorts of stuff and I would go and I make my dream 100 list of here's the top 100 podcasts
 I want to get on okay, and then I said okay now my job my goal is to get on all these podcasts
 And what's gonna happen is while you're on these podcasts is a couple of things number one
 This is free traffic right you're not paying to be to be on these podcasts you're getting on to be interviewed
 So number one it's not costume. I mean number two is something you can be doing every single day so it's continuing momentum
 As opposed to like buying an ad you're writing out in the city act and waiting like nervously tapping your fingers
 Like waiting for the thing to happen like it's something active you can be doing to move forward
 Number two is that you're gonna have a chance as you're on these podcasts to be interviewed and start listening to like what did
 What did uh, you know what are the phrases people are asking what the questions are asking?
 Where are people responding to what are they not responding to I was talking Nick Fitzgerald yesterday and he didn't event right before funnel
 Or before on the two comical X event instead. It was interesting today as I was going through my content
 He's like some things he's like I felt it like I felt like it just hit it landed people connected with it
 And I was like that's something that most people miss when they're just being paid as like what are the things people connect with?
 And when you have this live platform like it's fascinating how quickly you find out like what are the things that hit one of the things that don't hit
 Even if you're just one-on-one in an interview with somebody like by you just sharing your message over and over and over again
 You start finding and refining like oh man
 That's the thing that the the host like his ears perked up
 I felt as I was delivering that I could feel the energy of that statement of that phrase
 They got people excited you start learning those things really really quickly
 And so if you go out then you do a podcast 5 podcast 10 podcast 30 podcast 50 podcast by doing that
 You will learn your what so much better like what is it? I'm actually selling wisdom market actually want
 Okay, so many times I've had a product that I tried to sell like the expert secrets book for example
 You may not know this but the first thing I did is the extra secrets book came out as I did the podcast circuit
 I went into the dream 100 like pulled every single podcast owner
 I could find and started going out there
 What's funny is if you bought one of the first 5,000 copies of the expert secrets book the title of the book
 Was the underground playbook for growing your mass movement online, right?
 I think that was the title that was the what and as I started doing interviews. I really quickly within within the first three or four
 interviews
 I realized that that subtitle did not connect to people no one wanted to build a mass movement and I was like oh
 And I every time I brought that up. It was just like okay like but it was just it didn't feel right
 I don't know how to explain other than like it was wrong and I learned that very quickly in podcast and I literally after like six
 Podcasts I messaged the publisher. I'm like before the next printing
 I'm like we're changing the subtitles like you can't do that
 I'm like we are freaking doing that because I found out from the market that is not what they want
 They do not want to build a mass movement the book can stay the same
 But the hook initially has to change so we change it from expert secrets
 The underground playbook to building your mass building a mass movement people who will pay you for your advice
 That was the old subtitle to the new one
 Which is the underground playbook to find your message build a tribe and change the world in fact
 I know who was my top
 I think I came in five or ten thousand copies of the first run
 But I know whenever people strong on Instagram or Facebook
 I'm reading Russell's book I know when they bought in the cycle because we literally changed the title of the book after hitting the podcast circuits
 Okay, because I found out that the messaging was wrong
 And I wish I would have done that before I wrote the book because the first ten thousand copies the cover has a different different
 Subtitled it's me has probably didn't know that and I found out that that was the message of revenue
 The people wanted to find their message
 They want to build a tribe and they want to change the world and that was the messaging that for the rest of the launch and has been going on
 For the last two years now, but I didn't know that until I hit the podcast circuits, okay, and we've sold
 Tens of thousands copies of book through the podcast circuit
 Okay, a couple other things about podcasts number one is Facebook is like if you look at if you're the dot-com
 Secret book I talk about cold traffic warm traffic and hot traffic
 Hot traffic is like your own buyers like that's like the people that are the best
 Okay, and they start moving down the spectrum
 Okay, and I would say the next best buyers after your own traffic are like podcast listeners because they may not be
 Your hot traffic, but they are definitely more than warm. They're listening to somebody talk about something every single day plugging into their ears
 Like podcast listeners are amazing because they're listening during the most intimate times in your life, right?
 We're while I'm on the treadmill while I'm
 Driving you know while I'm like you have different access to somebody's mind in a podcast that any other format
 It is by far like I think the best delivery mechanism is podcast
 And so the hot traffic's your own customers next is like podcast traffic and then it goes down to whatever like Facebook ads are like
 Are like warm to cold right because you're you're targeting based on interest like oh, I know they're interested in Tony Robbins and business
 Like now they're gonna see my ad but those are just warm people
 I don't know who I am like they're not they don't have an intimate connection with Tony Robbins specifically
 Maybe they're just they liked his page and so because that they're seeing the ad whereas podcast listeners
 You know they're like they subscribe they listen they plug in for 15 20 30 an hour a day to listen
 to the content like that is like and you know that just the fact that listen to podcast the average podcast listener makes over
 $100,000 a year so you know they actually have money and you have a format where you're not you don't have you don't have you know
 Five seconds of an ad try capture the tension you have a longer 15 30 60 minute
 Time to build a relationship with that audience before you push them to go go to your free plus shipping or your book offer your webinar things like that
 And so yeah, so again
 There's so many channels and dream 100 we'll go deeper throughout this year and as you guys get the traffic secrets book things
 I doubt like we'll build dream 100 channels like crazy
 But if I was you guys right now, especially Justin listening to you, but anybody like this message is for him
 But it's for everybody right now. I would say okay
 While I'm waiting for my ads to work the next things I'm hitting the circuits
 Just like I would if I was launching movie I'd be on Jimmy Fallon good morning America today
 So like all kind of stuff for you the equivalent of that is the podcast circuits
 So it's going to iTunes going to any podcast directory going through the top 100 top 200 top 300 of all these different channels and going into there
 And you may think I like oh, I'm not gonna get on top 10
 You don't have to get on top 10 list of the podcast like right now my podcast gets
 Anywhere from 10 to 3,000 downloads per episode. I'm not in the top 250
 Okay, I have enough listens to but for some reason iTunes hates me
 I don't know why they used to love me
 I was on the top 10 list for like two years and then they slap me and they won't even listen me the directory and that sucks
 But my podcast still gets insane amounts of downloads even if you get a podcast
 It's like 250 or 500 or maybe something listed doesn't not matter
 It just matters that you're getting out there you're gonna find your voice you're gonna find your message and find the hooks
 The angles like this is your time to learn and present and be able to figure out what it is you're selling how to sell like all those those
 Intricacies of your message will be learned during this podcast circuit
 But then like I said even
 Even if you're in smaller podcasts, they may have 500 people listen every up
 So those 500 people are their best buyers their best listeners people are connected and so if I was starting over from scratch
 That's how I do in fact if you watch the
 the
 The launch for for machema.com with with Dean and Tony teen Dean literally did 60 podcast interviews to launch that thing
 That's how he launched initially first step 60 podcast interviews when Tony Robbins launched new much or launched money mass
 Yeah, money mass to the game 220 interviews from podcast radio and TV before any paid ads
 Okay, when traffic secret books comes out guess what I'll be doing first the podcast circuits
 Like it is the it is it is where I would begin with so while you are buying ads and trying to figure that out
 Because again the ad part is gonna be frustrating and you're gonna lose momentum if doesn't hit initially and I do not need you
 I do not want I need you guys lose a momentum you need to be running as fast as you can everyone you guys
 What you need to be doing right now is going into the podcast directories building your dream 100 and then contacting say hey
 Hey, and don't it's like mass email mall. Hey everyone put it in a podcast like like listen to each of the podcast
 And they put in the time in the effort like I listen to a ton of podcasts
 And I want to make sure that when I get on the show with the podcast host like I don't look like an idiot
 I'm like hey dude. I listen your podcast is awesome. I'm a fair episode. We interviewed so and so that was super cool
 Hey, by the way, I've got a really cool message
 If you love if you want I love to be on the podcast I could talk about this this and this
 Those are the ones people return to your calls, right?
 So there you go podcast sisters. It's like the secret nest of the best buyers on the internet are all sitting there plugged in listening to stuff
 Every single day and the best thing about podcast hosts almost all of them are craving content
 They're looking for people to interview. It's not hard to get on their shows
 You just got to have an interesting story and then pitch the story to him
 Just like you would if I was trying to get on TV. I'd be like hey put me on the news tonight
 Like why like because I can tell you three things about how to blah blah blah blah right Justin for you
 I mean you got so much street cred already just like hey, I'm gonna show you guys how to get
 Had to land on dishes the struggles
 I had I'm tell you guys behind the scenes of how I got an American Idol and then how I got the dr. Pepper commercial
 I'm like and like that's an interesting interview like anyone would be like oh my gosh that'd be amazing and wouldn't just be like
 There's so many categories that would fit underneath
 It's not just like one category in iTunes
 There's there's so many categories and you could be on 30 50 interviews in the next 30 days if you just went out there
 I'm gonna start hitting the circuits contacting him listening to listening to part of some of his podcast message him directly
 Hey, love your podcast. I love you interview
 I think I could I would love to do a show with you if you'd be interested here's some things
 I can bring the table the stories I can tell and I guess that most people are craving
 Content and your story would be amazing. So there you go. Hope it helps you guys. I gotta jump
 I got an article happening right now
 I just wanted to message this before I got started today because I saw just this message
 I know he's not the only one struggling with this
 I know a lot of you guys are and hopefully this gives you guys a short guy even if you don't have an offer done yet
 Go hit the podcast circuits. Okay, you feel all you have is a landing page with the opt-in form go and hit the podcast circuits
 Like they are the secret what they call a secret honey pot of buyers that are sitting there waiting for you
 So while you're waiting again
 Facebook ads Google ads YouTube ads, that's the holy grail
 So we're working towards we want to get back to them
 We can set because that's when you can like sit back like these things running and they're making sales for you all day every single
 Day, but right now while you're waiting for that to hit now is time to the circuits. So anyway, appreciate you guys
 Hope that helps have an amazing day
