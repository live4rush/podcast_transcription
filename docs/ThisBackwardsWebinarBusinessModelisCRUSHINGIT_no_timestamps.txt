 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson and welcome you back to the marketing secrets podcast today
 I want to share with you another webinar model instead the one that I usually talk about
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question and this podcast will give you the answer. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody so if you've been listening to me for any amount of time or if you're at expert secrets or you've heard me rant about this
 I always tell people that the best business model in the world is to create a webinar and
 Selling your product for your service and then do that webinar live every single week for a year at least once a week
 When I watch click funnels, it's fun. I'm I'm writing my neck. Well, I'm researching for the writing my next book
 I'm going back through like my old calendar back from the very beginning of
 Clickfunnels launching it and I tell people I do one webinar a week and people like that's too hard to do one week
 I was looking at I had days during the first the first couple months. I was doing three webinars a day not a week a day
 Some weeks I was doing 10 plus webinars. I was doing like yes
 So I tell people that one week, but I was doing 10x that which is why click for a crystal big problem
 So there's a there's a there's a lesson for you in that as well
 But you know a lot of people who are just like I don't have a webinar yet. I don't have a product
 I suck at selling like there's all these these fears so because they don't do anything and so I'm like ah
 And today I was reminded I've got two friends that do this one in the real estate state space one in the internet marketing space
 And I have another friend who just started this also in like the only marketing world
 And but it's it's a model that's that's similar I talked about but different
 So again, whatever's talking about the model
 I think that you should be doing if you want to grow and scale your personal company is creating a webinar presentation
 And once a week giving that presentation over and over and over and over until you perfect the pitch till you've mastered it
 Intel well, she did forever fact that today
 I'm doing my fourth webinar in a row four weeks ago
 I've been doing the new secrets masterclass webinar
 She haven't seen yet go to secrets masterclass.com
 But I've got four weeks in a row and keeps getting better and better and better and same thing that again all all of you
 Guys should be doing but if you're gonna have a product yet Russell, I don't have a business yet
 I'm just trying to figure out this game and I want to learn it. Here is the idea. Okay
 It's basically becoming a webinar host
 So that means that means that you host other people and every single week you do a webinar for somebody else, right?
 So my my friends that do it
 what they do is that every whatever Thursday they do a live webinar and they bring in a different speaker each time and
 The speaker is someone who has a webinar someone who's done this thing that we're talking about right someone who who has it has an offer
 They've got a product out of service and so they bring these people on each week and they interview them and they they don't even interview
 They basically they have them on the webinar
 and
 The person does the entire webinar and in the end of it
 They sell their product their service and they just split the money 50/50 with the person
 So as a webinar host just see as know the way that the speaking business works right like what I was doing the
 Through webinars a day or the eight to ten a week the reason I was able to do that
 People like how do you do that like if you're just buying Facebook ads? How do you do it?
 It's like no wasn't just buying Facebook ads. That's why you got to read the traffic seekers book
 There's more than one way to get traffic, right?
 So I was going out and I was finding partners people with email lists and I would do a webinar at
 Eight o'clock or excuse me ten o'clock in the morning to this person's list and then at two o'clock to this person's list
 And at seven o'clock to this person's list
 So I had three webinars set up and each person will be promoting their specific webinar
 I come on the webinar do this I do my my presentation to my pitch and then at the end of it
 We split them what you split the money 50/50 basically with whoever the webinar hosts it so whoever's list you're doing the webinar to
 That makes sense and so
 What I'm suggesting is as as another business model for those you guys who are trying to figure this game out
 Trying to make money right now
 Well, you don't have your webinar yet if you become someone who hosts webinars, right?
 So that means you got to start building a list of people who want to listen webinars
 But then what's cool about it is it grows exponentially, right? So my friend who started this business model back in the day
 Get in and have a webinar so he found somebody who had a webinar who we know is converting
 So he said webinar registration page and he promoted it like crazy
 He got people to register for this webinar and
 But he didn't just say it was like a one-off webinar
 He said it's it's a webinar series right for people who want who want to do blog
 I want to you know, we're filling the blink and what's cool to go to webinar or zoom
 They both allow you simple what are called recurring webinars, okay? So for example
 tomorrow
 From a recording this we're doing a funnels Friday and when you register for funnels fr-funnels Friday
 It put you on a recurring webinar so it says basically it's like a 26 week webinar series
 So every single Friday there's a webinar called funnels Fridays and you come in and you register and every single week that was the recurring webinar
 He keeps happening right same years you're signing up for a recurring show, right?
 So my friend that did it he promoted it and he said okay this guy's got a webinar sells a thousand dollar product
 I'll convert to really really good and so I'm gonna make some money if I can get people to show up to his webinar
 So then he went out and promoted
 This webinar spent on a couple thousand dollars got people to register
 The guy got on the webinar did the webinar
 Pre webinar presentation sold some stuff and the money he made from that covered his ad spend and they took that money
 The the actual money he made and he bought more ads so the next week now
 You'll see he had 300 people registered for the webinar
 Red
 And then takes the cash to made and he starts promoting it and next week he gets another 300 people to register
 But it's recurring so the 300 from last week are still on there's they're still on the recurring webinar
 So the next week it comes out now
 He's got the 300 we registered last week the new 300
 And I got 600 people and he gets more people to show for the webinar
 And then he does a presentation with a different speaker selling a different pride a complimentary pride
 That's because his presentation sells at the end of it and it takes his commissions goes back by his more ads
 And he's got the 300 from two weeks ago the 300 from last week and he gets another 300 to register
 And I was got 900 or a thousand on the thing
 You know and he gets a new speaker to come in and speak new presentation sell a thing and he's doing that he's doing that and over a month
 Six months a year he builds lists from you know 100 people to a thousand to five thousand to ten thousand to a hundred thousand people
 Who are people who like to attend webinars?
 So they'd come a webinars and listen to training at the office of them if they the offer at the end of something like they go
 And they end up
 Buying the product of service and they built huge seven figure business is just doing that becoming a webinar host
 And then in the process of you sitting on literally a live webinar every single week for a year of other people doing their presentations
 You start getting better at like seeing what they're doing it
 How they're doing it and you start understanding it better at a different level and then you can come back
 As you start create your product your service then what's cool is at this point you like you now are gonna go and and launch your webinar
 You have a list of people who love to come the webinars who understand the process and understand there's gonna be a great content
 There's gonna be a selfie and they're used to it and then you come back and you've got this little hot list to buy from you
 Right, so you come out to your webinar a year later boom to this hot list of webinar attendees
 You make a bunch of money and then what happens?
 Okay, these 50 people using webinars with through the last year they all have a relationship
 But you do webinars to your list for them. They have reciprocity now now you go back them say
 I've had a webinar now kind of webinar to your list and say sure and they say sure and you go through now you do 50 webinars
 Of your own product everyone's list. Do you see how that works?
 Okay, people always ask like how in the world did you did you get all these people to do webinars when you launched clickfunnels and the reality is
 Was I had promoted a lot of people's webinars up to the point we launched clickfunnels
 I had relationships with people because people have good webinars and I promoted them and I didn't do it this strategically
 I didn't do it like every Thursday night is gonna be webinar. I have a whole process and we go through it
 I didn't I didn't know that in intuitively and so I didn't
 But can you see the power of that like you know when we launched clickfunnels like I went back to initially
 I emailed all the people that I'd ever promoted their webinar
 I said hey I got a webinar it's hot do you want to be part of it?
 And they're like yes, and so we got a ton of people on there and boom we started
 doing doing my thing and
 And that was the initial seed for clickfunnels. So anyway for you guys who are like stuck right now
 You're like I know Russ keeps talking about webinars. I should do it, but I'm not ready yet
 I don't have blah blah blah blah. I feel in the blank, you know
 It's like okay cool. Don't do it yet to become a webinar host
 Right and get a following get get a platform where you can get people to show up for webinar and then do webinars to other people
 Like that's a seven figure your business model right there before you introduce your product
 You're an insure product here to three to five to ten million bucks a year now that you got a webinar
 And you've got an outlist of people who have
 You've grown their webinar and now they will promote yours in exchange
 What anyway?
 So hope it helps. I think five is gonna start over from scratch. That might be one of the methods that I do
 It's like all right. I'm gonna promote other everybody else for a year
 I'm gonna build up a following people who like going to webinars or gonna sell a single crazy and
 Anyway, so all right. Hope that helps
 I gotta go because I've got a webinar today
 Wait Russell you are you saying you practice what you preach? Yes, I do get
 So well Russell, why don't you just automate it? You guys made like a million bucks so far in this webinar
 Why you just automate it might because every single week I tweak it
 I change that make little adjustments make it better and I better and better and and so that's what's happening
 I'm I from last week
 I know all these different tweaks and changes today
 I was spending the time making tweaks and changes and I go live again at two o'clock today, which is in
 Oh four hours. I'm gonna start getting ready
 But then keep doing that over and over and over again and
 That is that is the game. So anyway, I hope that helps that makes sense you guys so become a webinar host
 Just know that the next
 52 weeks you're gonna do 52 people's webinars inside of your industry
 You're gonna bring them on you're gonna let them do a thing you're gonna them sell you split the money 5050
 You pocket that you roll it back into ads as you grow your following bigger and bigger and bigger in a year from now
 You've now got five 10 20,000 30,000 people on your webinars now you got some then you have a platform
 You've done favors for 50 different people and they come back with your product boom you crush it to your list
 And the email everybody who you who you've done interview them last year
 So hey my new webinars hot is crushing it
 Do I do your list and your list and then you line it up and that becomes your number two in your business and you just crush it from there

 Hope that helps those who pay attention try and drop gold drops gold bombs all the times
 Hopefully this is one that you guys can all use and benefit from
 The fact some of you guys might my buddy the real estate market. He's got his own real estate business
