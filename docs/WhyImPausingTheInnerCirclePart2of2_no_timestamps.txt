 Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the marketing secret show.
 This is part two of the episode where I'm telling you why I pause my inner circle and some people have told me I'm crazy
 Some people think I'm insane
 but today I was gonna kind of tell you the rest of the story about why I did it and and
 Hopefully it'll help you as you're making some decisions in your personal life in your business as well
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody so left off talking about the history of the inner circle and how we got to the spot where we had a hundred entrepreneurs
 I was serving him and and
 It's crazy like how much?
 like
 I just want to keep
 Reemphasizing how fulfilling the work with this group has been for me as I wrote the expert secrets book and the traffic secrets book
 You know they they were you know again
 We have 90 97 almost 98 thousand people said a click funnel
 So obviously I don't know all the businesses but this sampling of a hundred people are the ones
 I have a chance like fill the poll all the time
 It's my my pulse on the market and what's happening was working. It's not working
 what we need to develop but we need to change or I need to teach like all the things came for my interactions with this with my group
 I'm in a circle and and and so
 It's been these really things where it's just like I love it so much. It's so important to me
 But about man six six months ago or so ago is when Todd Dickerson and I
 Tod my co-founder click funnels. We had this meeting and it was basically like look if we were to start this whole thing over from scratch click funnels
 like what would we do different and
 We called it our sacred cow meeting and this is basically said there's no sacred cows like anything goes like what everyone needs to change
 We we we need to change it and it doesn't matter how hard it is how painful this amount of the feature or the program or the thing
 We need to have that those hard conversations that aren't fun
 and so we did and went through a whole bunch of stuff and which is why some of these announcements that are happening click funnels are happening because
 We decided to look this thing we spent two years on and seven million dollars in development
 We're gonna stop working on it. We're gonna we're gonna sunset it, right?
 There's this thing over here and think over here and this program here and this coaching program the same like all these things were up on the
 Chocking blog
 with the for potential discussion like what we can do with it and one of the ones that was a sacred cow to me was my inner circle and
 Again, it's it's been
 like this amazing thing to me
 But right now, you know five years in the click funnels 15 years into this this career that I've been in
 You know, it's been it's been a lot of work
 and I think you guys see that from the outside between writing books and managing teams and software and events and and
 All the things it's become a lot and so
 Not only was it like I mean a shift things for for click phones
 But it's like what do we actually want like what's the point of us running this huge company doing these things if if our lives aren't
 doing exactly what we want and a big part of the the thing for me was like I'm
 Like I'm doing everything but my kids like my my oldest twins are gonna be in high school next year and
 the other kids are not far behind them in it's like I
 Have so many things happening. It's like I need more time for for the kids for everything and and also like
 You know, how much my time you know eight days twice a year plus a lot of Fridays?
 I'm spending with inner circle and why while it's amazing fulfilling
 It's also it takes a lot of time that I could be focusing on on the thing that's growing the most the thing that serves
 The most people which is which is click funnels, right?
 Which is the content that I create that's that's evergreen like writing a book or things like that that that live beyond just the moment and
 So for me I had to make that hard decision like what I do at the inner circle and just kind of put this in frame for everybody like
 Like inner circle nets me after everything over two million dollars a year. So it's like
 The sacred cow here is like am I gonna turn off a business and that's my $2 million a year
 But more importantly and more the thing was harder for me
 It was just like this relationship I have with these amazing entrepreneurs who are literally changing the world
 Okay, if you've been a fun hiking live you've seen the speakers most of them are from my inner circle like it's these are the people that I
 that we I work with directly, you know that we we
 anyway, we've been through war and back with with these guys and so
 That was the the more difficult choice and
 Finally I mean this is probably six months ago. I kind of made a decision like I need to I need to wind this down
 so I can spend all the extra free time with my family and then be able to focus 100% of my focus on our core business and
 and
 But it was like I couldn't tell anybody like I
 Didn't want to I didn't want to announce it because I knew how hard it was gonna be for me and for them and for everybody and so
 And so I didn't I delayed it. I delayed it. I delayed it until you know everyone was coming here on Monday
 And so Friday before I I finally did a Facebook live in the group and kind of told everybody
 This is what's happening and this is the plan and you know click funnels
 We have a mission to get to a billion dollar valuation which no no software companies ever done that wasn't backed by venture capital
 Like we're on a mission to do that. That's good. My focus when it comes to my work and then it's like
 Like my kids I need to spend more time there
 It's like I can't keep juggling all these things and a lot of things are getting cut a lot of things
 You mean shifted and one of the big ones that that unfortunately I have to pause right now is the inner circle
 And I told them like I'm pausing for a couple reasons
 Number one is inner circle for life like you guys are in this for life
 And I want to keep creating things that you can be part of and you can network and you can
 We can keep the community together, but
 but number two I
 Just need to pause it for a while and
 It's not indefinitely like someday
 I'll step down as a CEO clickfuddles and I'll have more time and my kids be graduate from high school
 I don't know where where when but I want to bring it back with the same group of entrepreneurs and and have a door for
 Some of you guys who who have been working towards that and trying to prepare yourselves and
 Building businesses and changing people's lives to be in there. I want I want that to still be something that's available and possible
 It's right now. I announced that it's gonna be it's gonna be paused and
 Man, I can't tell you how much fear I had making that announcement and how
 difficult and hard it was because I was so scared that these people that I've that I've learned to love and respect and to
 Literally been on the front lines of business war with
 How they were gonna accept it and some might be upset might be frustrated might be angry and you know people pay a lot of money to be in that group
 you know we
 Had over a year a year and a half ago. We raised a price of 25,000 years 50,000 hours a year
 They still stuck in they still want to be part of it. So
 Anyway, so that's that's kind of the that's kind of
 Where where's that and so the last piece of the story?
 I'm gonna tell you about the first days of inner circle and I have the next days next you know
 Thursday and Friday, but Monday and Tuesday have been
 so
 Emotional and hard and amazing
 I felt like it was almost like my funeral like everyone had a chance to get up and thank me for your stuff
 Which was really really special, but the other interesting thing that I kind of got that I didn't expect was
 for a lot of people and I'm gonna
 Tell you paying June's experience because it was one that's probably the most tangible and relevant for you guys
 But paying June told me he said you know after he made the announcement that night. He was like
 I laid in bed. I couldn't sleep and he started thinking he said, you know
 I joined inner circle four years ago five years ago he launched ClickFunnels. He's like he's like we've seen now
 It's possible is like what am I gonna do over the next five years?
 You know five years now I could build a company to a billion dollars
 But but I guess we're looking at things differently and acting differently and and it actually became motivational for him
 I had other people like and it's the homes who just told me she said, you know
 Like you're taking this breaks over time with your family and she's like it made me reflect back and like man
 Do I need to take a break do I need to spend my family what shifts do I need to make in my life and my business as well?
 And so I hope that
 Me doing me pausing this not only is it gonna buy me some time
 It's better my family and my kids and focus on our core mission which I think is important
 But hopefully it inspires some of you guys to look at as well
 You know sometimes there are things that are really really good
 Like this inner circle group is something good. It has changed my life. It's changed their life has changed license so many people but
 There are things that are great like your family that you can't get that time back no matter what it's like
 We sacrifice great things for I will or she would sacrifice good things for great things
 And I hope that some you guys get that lesson second thing is just showing you as what's possible in five years like five years ago
 We didn't have a click funnels
 Six years ago like I we were at the brink of bankruptcy trying to like keep the doors open while Todd was building click funnels
 Right like it's amazing what can happen the next five years and and I hope that that you guys look at this
 Is a moment to stop making what's possible for me in the next five years? What's my what's my vision?
 What's the direction? What am I running towards? What can I go and try to accomplish?
 and so
 Yeah, so that's some of the reasons I want to share with you
 to end with
 I'm gonna actually read you a little piece of the traffic seekers book and
 I read this to the inner circle members and I told him I see look click phones has again
 98,000 members, but I said you know when I when I think about like when I'm creating things
 I was like I'm creating for the inner circle there like they are the face of the customers
 I see all the time people I know their names under their family
 They're the kids that other employees and other staff like I know their vision their mission like like so for me like I
 Like my lens of this entire huge community is the inner circle and so as I was writing
 the dedication for the traffic seekers book
 It was interesting. I started thinking I'm like what would like I can't remember the dot-com seekers expert secrets book
 Who did I dedicate those books to and I opened the dot-com seekers book and it was interesting because I dedicated it
 To my mom and my dad and my wife Collette
 Then I look the expert secrets book and I dedicated to all the experts who were willing to put out their information to change my life
 And then I dedicated to my kids
 And so the third book as I was writing it and as I was sitting down right the dedication I started thinking about
 this community and
 Start with inner circle, but it also bleeds down to you to every single person here in my voice right now as my funnel hackers
 The third book is dedicated to all of you
 And so I wanted to to read you the dedication and hopefully to get you pumped to read the book when it comes out
 But I'm also helping understand why this work and this mission has been so important to me
 Here goes here we go
 So this book is dedicated to the entrepreneurs who I've been called to serve my funnel hackers
 You made it possible for me to do a work that interests me that I feel is meaningful and worthwhile
 This final book in the secret trilogy was created to help you find more of the people who are waiting to hear your message
 If this book helps you to reach even just one more person and change their life with your God-given gifts then this work was a success
 And so as I told
 Yesterday when I set up with the first group inner circle
 I read that to them and I bald my eyes like a little baby
 But I hope that as you heard that
 You understand like if you're listening to this if you're filling the calling the tug the pole that's got you into this
 Community into click funnels into my podcast and all these things it's because you have a God-given gift or talent or something
 And and you've been called to do something with that to help get your to help change somebody's life in some way, right?
 That's why you that's why you tune in this way you listen this way you dream. That's why you have these visions
 because of that and so if everything that I've done to this point in my career 15 years
 But five years of click funnels and with the books and the coaching all these things
 if if my work has helped you to help change somebody's life then
 It's all worth it and if you change you more people's life than it man, it's it's it's insane
 There's one more thing I want to share with you, but I'm not gonna share on this podcast
 I'm gonna I'm I doing the next one. It was a message that one of the members of the inner circle said about
 About funnels and about anyway, I'm gonna save that one for you
 So there's my hook to hook you to the next episode
 but hopefully you got something from these ones and
 For any of you been striving to work you towards getting into my inner circle someday keep striving
 It's not gonna be long. It's not gonna be a 20 year thing when I bring it back
 I told them all I said look it might be a year for now might be two years from now
 But I'll be sending email out saying okay, I'm back and we're opening it back up
 This is what's gonna look like and at that point I hope that you are prepared and ready
 Because I'd love to have you as part of this group this group of people who are changing the lives of millions people around the world
 And they've changed my life as well. So grateful for my inner circle members who were listening. Thank you for
 for the last
 five or six years and
 Keep doing what you're doing. I'm so proud of you and impressed with with the lives you've changed and for everyone else
 Just keep moving forward towards that goal and
 Someday I hope to have a chance to sit with you in one of my meetings for my mastermind groups and have a chance to see how you're changing the world as well
 All right. Thanks everybody. Appreciate you all and have an amazing amazing day
