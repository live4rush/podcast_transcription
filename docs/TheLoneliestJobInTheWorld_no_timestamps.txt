 Good morning everybody this is Russell Brunson and we're about to start marketing
 Secrets Podcast episode I'm in the airport I almost got an wreck literally live on
 radio but here we go have some fun so the big question is this how are
 entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending
 money from our own pockets how do we mark it in a way that lets us get our
 products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and
 yet still remain profitable that is the question in this podcast we'll give you
 the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 all right everybody so head to the airport I'm about to go to a secret
 meeting there's 10 people that got invited to the secret meeting and I'm
 not allowed to say anything else about it is that crazy I am like the worst
 secret keeper in the world people like hey Russell can you keep a secret like
 no why would you tell me I've written two books that literally all they are is
 me showing every secret I've ever heard my whole life so don't trust me
 secrets and this is killing me but I'm gonna tell you everything that I'm not
 allowed to tell you everything I'm allowed to tell you about getting in
 trouble so Brandi Mujardt said this thing up I don't feel good trouble for that
 crap anyway and he like messed a bunch of people who's like this is a secret
 meeting of a bunch of titans of different industries all moving together to plan
 the world domination it's kind of like the Illuminati I think or maybe the
 builder burger I don't know something cool ninja like that maybe not anyway so
 I mean all these cool people and I'm like the internet software nerd dude who's
 coming in there's like all these other legit people who are coming like one of
 them's like a multi-billion dollar year supplement company there's I can't
 tell me in trouble anyway I'm excited so I'm heading there now to the airport to
 go flat hang out those dudes for a couple days and then from there flying to
 Dana Derek's dream 100 conference Dana did me a little favor last year when we're
 doing the viral video launch we read to the sales page for click funnels and he
 flew in and spent a week actually he didn't fly and he's scared of planes he
 literally like found a dude like a retired truck truck driver and paid the
 guy to drive him to Boise which is like a I don't know 30 hour drive and so he
 sat in the back car like worked on stuff while this dude just drove him which
 is insanely cool so anyway I love Dana he learned how to fly since then and he
 was like oh my gosh this is way faster and easier but a year ago he was he was
 scared of airplanes so he drove to Boise spent a week with me work on sales
 letter got me an overalls doing the whole go dancing it was funny in exchange
 he wanted to speak his event next year which is now this week so flying out
 there talking about some cool things his whole his whole thing is about dream
 100 which is exciting and I've been working on the traffic secrets book which
 is coming out and there's a whole foundational layer of dream 100 and how
 it ties into like all the different marketing channels I'm gonna be sharing
 that for the first time live on stage I was having sight of force kind of me
 testing out the concepts for the book and getting people's feedback the first
 time so it'll be fun I'm looking forward to that that's what's happening for me
 right now and in that vein I want to talk about something interesting so I'm
 heading this event like why do I still do events why do I still go to events
 why do I run events and the reason why is because my life was changed by going
 to live events so I was an internet nerd who sat behind my computer all day
 thinking I was the stuff right and I don't know about you but entrepreneurship
 is the loneliest job in the world right especially when you're first
 getting started because like nobody believes in you you're you're you're
 depending on who you are but most I like spouses don't believe your friends don't
 believe like your coworkers I literally I was building my my first internet
 company I was also painting at a paint place during summer breaks and and the
 owner of the paint shop was afraid or the paint whatever company was a friend
 and remember I would tell most I'm learning about I'm so excited and then
 at first it was like a cool thing and then like I believed it was gonna work
 so I could talk about like my dreams my visions when I was gonna try to create
 and do it and it's funny because you think that people will be like supportive
 of them they go that's amazing you should do that but guess what they're
 typically not in fact at that point where I would come into work and the
 owner of that company and other people would start teasing me like hey Russell
 why you hear that thought you're gonna be retired by now oh I thought you're
 gonna be millionaire why you like all sorts of stuff like that my my family my
 brother who's that editing this and his wife who are transcribing this will
 laugh at this part but we when I was a kid growing up I used to order all the
 junk mail right I would read all the junk mail and people have their making
 money I was like this is the greatest thing in the world I would always tell
 me I'm gonna be a millionaire like I'm gonna be a millionaire so soon and my
 brothers and sister and everyone would tease me like oh Russell you millionaire
 yet oh you millionaire yet and I'm like no I'm still working on I'm 13 give me
 some time and but it's just funny because you expect and initially everyone's
 gonna be like I'll pump for you but what you find out is that at first they're
 not they're like skeptical and I think a lot of times it's because they love you
 and they care about you and they don't want you to get hurt right because it's
 it's a scary road and so typically people aren't super like sweet you should
 chase these entrepreneurial dreams they're more like oh like dude like you should
 just like do what everyone does and just kind of you know do the normal path and
 again they have good intentions but that's typically what happens so
 entrepreneurship at first is very very lonely road and so for me I was I still
 remember I was doing my thing behind my computer and back then this is like
 pre-Facebook pre it was hard like there are some forums you can go talk to
 people but it was still really lonely and like I didn't have him to talk about
 I just like was reading and learning and I explained to my wife and she like
 looking me like I have no idea talking about I'm like I'd try other people and
 they're like that sounds awesome but like it was just tough and so remember the
 very first event I ever went to I went there and a couple amazing things happen
 the first off I went there and I got to the room and it was like I think there's
 about four or five hundred people in this room and I got there and instantly I was
 just like oh my gosh there are other people on this planet to think like me
 like these are my these are my people I remember thinking that I remember like
 sitting in the hallways talking to people in St. Blaine and I in the hotel
 rooms till like three or four in the morning I was like I can't believe I'm
 having these discussions with other people who actually care about the same
 thing I'm talking about and we geek out on and talk about the ups and the
 downs and the struggles and the ideas and the concepts and like like oh it was it
 was like like plugging in life in my in my bodies I was going through this this
 process right and so I'm I'm I'm found my tribe of people and I finally had these
 connections and when I left the event was amazing because I had these I had
 friends I had people I could call on the phone and Skype and talk about it like
 and it was cool I so the first things I found my people number two is I started
 finding vendors like I didn't know where to find people to do all these
 different things and I'm in this room with all the you know at the time 500 or
 so people and I'm like I mean people and some guys like oh yeah I do whatever
 and I'm like what like I need it I need that and then someone's like I do this
 and I do this and like I built out my Rolex that people are able to help me
 in all the different aspects and dramatically sped up my my my process and
 what was cool is because I met him face to face it wasn't like I went to the
 website and I contacted him through contact form and they didn't know what
 it was it was like hey do you remember the day we were hanging out it was funny
 for me like they'd always go to the bar afterwards and I'm like the you know
 the clean cup more me kidding is like I don't know what to do to bars I go to
 the bar with him because I wanted like keep talking to everybody and it was
 funny because like they're all drinking and I was like and first time I ordered
 like a water and and again I know nothing about drinking and so like the guy
 came back like hey do you need another scotch I'm like I don't even know what
 that means like or vodka I don't even know like whatever the drinks are right
 and I was like oh my gosh people here think I'm drinking like this is awkward
 I don't want people thinking I'm drinking because again I'm the clean cup
 warming kid right so I was like oh so I started ordering milk at the bars it's
 so funny it's they bring out this big old cup of milk because I was like I
 don't want people thinking I'm drinking and so I have this big like cup of milk
 and people were kind of like what are you drinking I'm like milk like what I
 like one more one side of drink like well why would you order milk I'm like
 because I don't want you guys to eat I'm drinking so like anyway so I go so like
 I'd have this connection point though and so I like all people up I'm like hey
 this is Russell right Russell again the dude who's drinking milk with you at the
 bar like oh you're the you're the morning guy I'm like yes I am and like we had
 instant connection and rapport and so it's easy to start doing deals because
 because they had that connection point I can connect with people met him so I
 was the next huge huge benefits number one was I found my people I had
 friends now who I can communicate about this this thing I was geeking out about
 I had relationships number two is I will meet with vendors and find all the
 different pieces that I needed to help grow my company right number three is I
 had a chance to go to the event actually learn from people which was really
 really cool and so for me is like it was interesting because like I had kind of
 folks on one thing but the event promoters have brought in different
 speakers different topics and it helped round me out I started to say like oh I
 can remember I didn't know what copywriting was and the very first event
 there was this dude Michael Fortin who's a great copywriter to talk about
 copying conversion I was like what I didn't know that was a thing like who
 knew I needed a headline like I didn't and I remember him talking about
 conversion and it was funny I never split head I didn't know split testing was
 the time but he was showing all these split tests like I did red headline
 versus the blue headline this what happened I did this versus then and I was
 like oh my gosh I'm taking notes also like I went home and I was able to like
 take what the test that he had he had figured out and I just I just modeled it
 right like I remember one of his tests was like a red headline out converts a
 blue headline I was like he's serious so I'm back to my little funnels back at
 the time I wrote a headline I made a red and sure enough guess what increase
 conversions and I gave myself a raise and I was like oh this is amazing so I
 started like learning these amazing things coming back and implementing back
 into my little funnels I had at the time we didn't call them funnels back then
 but that's we call them mini sites went back and ended up my little mini
 sites oh crap this happens we're in my pain attention I'm late to the airport
 already and podcasting oh dang and the freeway is completely jam-packed all right
 guys you are gonna be part of a live experience to see if Russell can make it
 to the airport in time to go to his top secret meeting with the Bilderberg or
 the Illuminati anyway we'll podcast the whole process because I don't make it
 then we'll just keep going it'll be fun all right so anyway where I leave off okay
 so met friends met connection started learning really cool things in in different
 areas I wouldn't have ever assumed and thought like brought new new concepts
 and strategies to my mind number four amazing thing that happened was it was
 at this event this event is different than like Final Hockey Live but this
 event it was a multi-speaker man where every speaker spoke and then they sold
 now this was the first time I had ever seen something like that some of you
 as I've heard me tell this story before about how I got into becoming a public
 speaker but I was a shy awkward nerdy kid who never talked to anyone ever super
 introverted still am and anyway so I'm sitting there first event the first
 speaker gets up he talks for 90 minutes I still remember his Mike Lippmann if
 you guys my Mike Lippmann is dude's awesome I still remember to this day the
 Todd's concept about he said amateur's focus on the front end and I was like
 what he's like yeah these CDs we sell it cost me $30 to sell a CD and he's like
 but guess why I'm winning I'm like why is it because amateur's folks on the
 front end I have this back end thing and he started talking about like everybody
 buys a CD I call him the phone I saw him coaching I was like what like my whole
 world was just shattered right and he's telling this whole thing and I was like
 amateur's folks on the front end my whole business point I've been focusing on
 the front end and I don't want to be an amateur I want to be a professional
 he's like professionals you know they go in the hole in the front end so I can
 make their profits on the back end and it was like boom paradigm shift and in
 the end of it he sold a program it's like hey I'll teach you guys how to do
 this whole thing I'm doing free plus shipping CDs and calling them on the
 phone and selling coaching and he sold a fight to grand and I watch as people
 in this room start jumping up and running the back of the room and as you
 in the math I made two four six eight ten my bedroom just made sixty five
 thousand dollars an hour I was like I've never even experienced something like
 that made they made more money than ours I made entire last year right and the
 next guy gets up he starts speaking about something and again I give the
 pifties a ha and then like he sells something and then I'm doing the math
 that guy sold like a five thousand I think I'm like five ten fifteen twenty
 twenty twenty that got me to hundred grand and like my whole I saw how people
 were selling and like it's funny to me nowadays and people like I went to an
 event somebody sold and I was all upset and I'm like what event wasn't like it's
 a marketing and selling event I'm like so you went to a marketing and selling
 event you had a chance to experience somebody sell something and you got upset
 about it like it's a 10x event this year it's funny because I sent me as
 further story I went on the event there are nine thousand people and I sold
 three point two million dollars in products in 90 minutes and it's funny is
 this event was there to teach people how to sell I had a couple people I saw
 like in Facebook after I went to the 10x event but you know Russell's
 presentation was good but then he just sold something in the end I'm like dude
 you paid to learn how to sell and you watch somebody orchestrated three point
 two million dollar hour like that was worth more than the price of admission
 like you should be studying and dissecting and diagramming everything I did
 right so for me I'm like I'm watching each speaker get up on stage back here
 and I'm watching it it was just like it was it was like seeing behind the scenes
 of everything I dreamt about doing and I started and that's like how I went on
 this whole path of like I have to learn how to like sell from stage and and doing
 these closing techniques and how to like tell stories and I like I learned
 like watching people as well you know for those who came to last year's fun
 hacking live to me may or may not know this we only sell one thing a fun hacking
 life so it's not a multi-day everyone's pitching and selling one thing for sell
 and the one thing we sell is is the actual R2 comic club ex coaching we only
 open it once a year it's at the events only way to buy it is at the event and
 last year's event for those who were there I did $12 million in sales at the
 event and so it's like if you want to learn how to sell coaching or consulting
 or anything like like if you watch the process we orchestrated the thing like
 like that alone is worth the price of admission times a hundred right and so
 like at the event I learned how to sell I started watching this thing I started
 like learning how to break down presentations and so that was another
 like unintended benefit that I had and it went on and on but the event like
 literally changed my life so why am I sharing this with you guys well a
 couple reasons one is I'm going to defense weekend because and I go because
 I know that transformation happens in events faster than anywhere else so I
 love going to events because I love seeing people have that transformation
 if it was if if I wasn't married didn't have kids I'd be going to three or four
 events a week that's how that's how important how impactful they are both
 for me as an attendee but also as a speaker like I can have more impact on
 someone there face-to-face in a room that I can ever in a million years on
 podcasts or webinars or any any virtual means and so that's a big part
 number two is we have funnel hacking live coming up and this year is going to be
 amazing the first year we did it we had about 600 people come second years
 1200 30 years 1300 we sold out like in like a month so I was like always try
 make a little bit bigger last year we had about 3,000 ish and this year we're
 gonna have about 4500 we've already sold almost 2,000 tickets so there's not
 gonna be a lot more but what's interesting to me is as of today we have
 65,000 active click funnel members we have less than 5,000 tickets so it's
 like less than 5% is that the math whatever that this is like 5% of all active
 click funnel members will have a chance to come to it yet it's a thing that if
 all things we do it will have the biggest impact on somebody's business and on
 somebody's life it's interesting as that we were talking about yesterday in the
 office we were looking at the two comic club wall and if you've ever seen my
 pictures like we've got the entire bathroom hallway is is wallpaper in two
 comic club awards now the kitchen is completely wallpaper to some people that
 have now hit the two comic club it's like I don't know three or 400 people now
 we're the two comic club X program which means they had over ten million
 dollars we have a whole wall just those think we have 25 or so people have hit
 that now and it's going up every single day and we're sitting there talking and
 as we're reading the names off like we know most people like how do I know all
 these names and like the interesting thing behind the majority not all of
 them but the majority of all the people who are on the wall is they come to our
 events like it's weird like what are the top 1% doing like I'm a big believer in
 modeling right like I look at like what is the top 1% doing they're going to live
 events so what should I do I should go to the live event right when you come to
 fun liking I just could just like understand it and get our events not like
 any other event ours is closer to a rock concert than a marketing seminar I got
 a lot of marketing seminars it's hard to stay awake it pretty much all of them
 honestly I don't need to be rude but it's insane like the like I don't know
 marketing for whatever reason people have not done a good job and I've tried to be
 the person who made marketing fun again and sexy and exciting and like
 bringing the energy and making it what it should be like this is the most
 exciting topic on planet earth we should be freaking out going crazy jumping and
 screaming and dancing because we learned something and two things happen number
 one we make a crap ton of money number two we changed somebody's life like what
 is more exciting than that and so I think the last I don't know decade or two
 decades or since the Pony Express began we had direct mail like marketing events
 have always been boring and I'm trying to like make these things exciting so that
 all of people like me will actually come to them because if there's entertainment
 it's exciting and fun like it's awesome so that's number one it's number fun like
 life's different from anything else you'll ever experience I promise you that the
 speakers we bring people like I've never heard of any speakers why not like
 because I don't bring the dudes and the ladies who are on every single stage
 speaking people come to our events are people who are actually doing it they're
 ClickFunnels members there are two comic Club winners there are people who are
 doing unique interesting things that you would never have a chance to see unless
 you have the birds I view like I do like I'm watching everybody I'm watching 65,000
 members like what are the funnels that are interesting that are different and
 so I'm able to bring those out so those are the speakers you're gonna hear from
 people in different markets different industries who are doing the most
 fascinating things you can look at you can learn them bring it back to your
 specific business okay so the learning is second to none because again most
 people are polished stage presenters these are people who are your peers people
 who last you are sitting in the audience who are now looking at you like for
 example what am I I'm excited for all presentations one that I'm really excited
 for some you guys know Jamie Cross Jamie Cross came to Funloch and I have two
 years ago at the bottom of her you know her her journey like struggling
 financially and she came to the Funloching Live she had a mission she she had
 like literally like a revelation like I need to start this soap company and so
 she starts this like natural soap company right and she's she hears the voice her
 heads and you do the singing she's going and she's doing it she's moving
 forward and but she doesn't know what to do she comes this thing and she's out of
 money and I'm talking about perfect webinars and she's like I'm selling soap I
 can't do webinar for soap but you know I was led to come to this thing and so I'm
 gonna do a perfect webinar for my soap and she does a webinar the first one bomb
 second one bomb serving on bombs fourth and she keeps trying and trying and trying
 she's like I this doesn't make any sense right I get tons of people who are
 like Russell I read expert secrets but I'm selling physical products doesn't make
 sense but she didn't say like this won't work for me she said how can this
 work for me how can this work for me and she kept doing the webinar doing it doing
 it and she kept tweaking and modifying it to then she came out to she made a
 five-minute webinar following the exact same process in the perfect webinar I
 get insane she had a Facebook live with five with this five-minute webinar
 selling a physical products soap and that her natural soap she creates in her
 basement what she used to now she's now now she's now now she's she's she's big
 time she's as it's been growing really fast but she did it finally boom one of
 the webinars she did hit it's a five-minute perfect webinar selling soap and it hit
 within like six weeks and a hundred and thirty thousand dollars and it was like
 boom off to the races and it's funny I thought she joined the inner circle she
 was all in and it was crazy it's the coolest thing in the world the next year's
 fun-liking life so exactly a year later she's a fun-liking live I believe if I
 remember the story right I think it was her anniversary she's their anniversary
 birthday I think it was an anniversary and it was like the day at Funnel
 hiking life where we were delivering two comic-level awards on stage everybody
 and that morning she came in she's like we we hit we crossed two comic-level like
 today we've literally passed it into our anniversary it's a huge thing I was like
 he's serious she's like yeah she's like but it's probably too late for me to get
 the award I'm like are you freaking kidding me like this is the best time on
 earth to get their award so she went and like submitted all the financial
 numbers we we found it was like oh my gosh she literally hit it to the day that
 the two-com awards were being handed out and so we had a chance to return her
 and her on stage and give them this award on stage and so I'm excited because
 again two years ago she was attending last year literally at the event during
 the two-com awards you earned her two comic club and this year she's gonna be
 showing like hey if you're some physical products here's my five-minute perfect
 webinar and she's gonna talk about it and then she's literally going to do her
 five-minute webinar on stage like how cool is that you guys are gonna see it
 like here's somebody who did a thousand perfect webinars for physical products
 to crack the code on how it actually worked and you're gonna have her explain
 the concepts behind it how it worked what a funnel looks like and then she's
 actually going to do it live for you and you will see her do the webinar if
 you're selling any product physical product digital product anything like
 how valuable is that you're not gonna get that anywhere else on planet earth
 but she's gonna come and share it and so for me I have this bird's eye view like
 what's the fascinating interesting things that are happening inside our
 community and we bring those people to share with the what they're doing
 again so that's just gonna happen a funnel hiking live and you're gonna
 learn from these people that are I came in I came to tell you like how excited I
 am for the people that are coming alright so that's number one or two after
 that you're what's gonna be really cool is we have more launching a new
 funnel role that some of you know about that if you are a service provider and
 you want to be in our role that's go to funroll the next dot com we're
 building out the thing right now but we're having a literally a networking

 you'll see those things we've got so many cool things Lindsey Sterling if you
 has no Lindsey Sterling she was someone who was on America's Got Talent she
 made it two or three rounds in and the judge was like you're out of town you're
 never gonna make it she's a dancing violinist right she's like us she's an
 artist who creates and does these new things but what she does is so
 different nobody's ever heard of it no one's ever heard of a dancing violinist
 low on America's Got Talent that it after the low-out like you're just not
 gonna make it sorry the kick draw instead of like being all bum she's like
 you know what I've got something unique here I'm gonna do something and so she
 went out there just like any of us and she started doing what building or
 following building her tribe she had a YouTube channel started music videos so
 doing some stuff and very quickly she built the following of millions of
 people and now she's like one of the highest sought after artists in the world
 right doing dancing violinist like it's insanely cool she also has a part with
 OUR and so there's really cool time so we have Lindsey Sterling coming and I'm
 gonna interview her on stage talking how she built the whole how she built her
 whole empire and then she's gonna do a private concert for us you are gonna see
 Lindsey perform and I've actually seen her in concert before it is insane and
 the fact they have her coming is oh cuz it's not just like we could have been a
 concert like oh we're gonna bring somebody come sink you know it's someone who's
 like she's from the same foundation that we're from right like somebody who is
 an entrepreneur who has a vision and a dream and was told no yeah she said all
 right well how can I know I got told no to all the typical means but like how do
 we build this thing online let's let's leverage YouTube and join ventures and
 traffic and generation and following subscribers and like and let's let's
 do it the grassroots way the same way that we're doing it and she built a huge
 following has made a huge successful business so you're gonna find a how she
 did that and then she's actually gonna perform we're gonna have a chance to see
 her art up close and personal and like I can't even tell you excited for that
 it's gonna be insanely cool and yeah it goes on and on and on there's so much
 stuff you guys anyway I just want to tell you that because tickets are for
 sale right now they won't be for so long we will sell out we sold out every
 year in the past the first 2000 and I think we only have like 200 or 300 left
 this morning so this may not be for everyone but for the first 2000 tickets
 sold what we're doing is I took all the last four years of fun I
 came back in lives and I took all the presentations I put them on a pre-loaded
 mp3 player and then we have this dude Tim Castleman who comes to every single
 fun liking live and he takes notes of every presenter and like his notes are
 insanely good and then he sells them afterwards for a couple hundred bucks
 every year so I went back and I acquired the rights back to all last four years
 notes and I put him in the spiral bound binder it's like 400 it's like four
 five hundred pages of notes of all the speakers and so any of the first 2000
 people especially for you guys who love podcast because you're listening right
 now it's literally four years of our events you listen to mp3 player and you
 have all the notes pre-done so you can take notes on his notes of all the last
 four years I want you to like binge listen to it so when you show up to
 funnel hacking live like you're up to speed and like you're able to hit the
 ground the ground running so much magic inside of the mp3 notes like I
 literally the we had the first binders shipped to our office yesterday I was
 holding it and I'm holding this fat huge binder all the notes and mp3 player I
 was like I would have paid conservatively five thousand dollars for this alone and
 and we're literally giving it the first two thousand for free so if you if
 you're coming like you should get that gift because it's insane but it's only
 two thousand and we pre-sold it seven hundred fifty five tickets sold before
 the event started I think we've sold like six or seven hundred right now maybe
 more than eight anyway whatever the numbers are but when it but we only got
 two thousand physical copies and so the first two thousand people will get that
 shipped out as well so if I was you and you're right dude I want to listen to
 like 800 hours of funnel building stuff like even if you didn't come to the
 event go buy take an event just for that alone but you should come to the event
 because it'll change your life anyway that's that's the process you guys the
 last thing I want to mention is so far before the events you can start I've
 already spent over a million dollars to put this party on for you now if I had
 a friend who is obsessed with marketing and funnels and you're obsessed with
 as well and he spent a million dollars to throw a party and all you gotta do is
 cover the thousand dollar ticket costs to come to the party I would totally
 come right like and that's not some kind of exaggeration you guys like we
 feed you guys all the guys I had to prepay for the food I had a prepay for
 Lindsey she doesn't come free I had a pretty favorite other speakers like we're
 a million dollars right now before the events even started just to throw this
 party for you so if you're trying to like convince your spouse or your
 company or your friends be like look this is the dude this is the deal one of
 my friends he's a sustained funnel building marketing nerd and he's
 throwing a party he spent a million dollars with parties so far I have to
 go experience it if you tell some that if they don't if they don't like say
 you definitely should go to that like they're crazy right so for you guys like
 hopefully you hear that you're like yes I'm in I'm gonna go to this party
 because one of my friends I'm your friend well my friend Russell he spent a
 million dollars to throw a party I'm not gonna miss it we only throw a couple
 parties a year and they're worth coming to last year at Farahaki live which was
 insane and then we did we threw a bubble soccer we said against the world record
 event and we had people that would too like we really do like one or two
 parties a year and this is this is the big show you guys I promise you if you
 come and you play full out and you experience it this will change your life
 and I know people throw that around all the time but I'm not kidding ask anyone
 who came last year ask anybody who has been to any of our fun lacking live

 similar time and their events you will learn good content I promise you you will

 time so that's it you guys it's gonna be Nashville Tennessee this year I promise

 trajectory of your life it's funny when to Tony Robbins date with this and he
 said something kind of similar I didn't I didn't know if I believe I was like
 cool yeah I'm gonna go to then and it was interesting if you talked about he's
 like this event will make a shift where the focal point what you're going is
 just different right it said what's gonna happen though if you look at a
 year from now five years from now ten years from now your entire desk like
