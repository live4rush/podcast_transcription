 Hey everyone, it's Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing secrets podcast today
 I want to talk about something you probably don't consider marketing yet. It really actually is
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody, so
 I hope you're an awesome this whole last weekend for me was amazing
 I got nominated to be entrepreneur of the year here in this region of the country and I had a chance to go to Utah
 my family my kids by the time my parents and had a great time and then went to the actual ceremony and
 We won whoo-hoo
 So we don't really do here in the tech category
 And now I've qualified to go on to the nationals which will happen November and then if I win that then I can go to the world
 And then maybe there's like a universe or I don't know I don't know if it's at that point where it where it goes
 But um, it's uh, it's pretty awesome. So
 Anyway, but now I'm back in Boise and after a long five hour drive yesterday getting back home
 I had a chance to go back to my old high school, which was
 Really cool on nostalgia. I went back to the wrestling room, which my high school are actually tearing it down
 So this is my 20 year unions this year and they're tearing it down
 Which means it'll uh it'll be gone the room the wrestling that I grew up in that I trained in that I practiced it in every single day that
 literal blood sweat and tears
 For four years five years my life was in that room and it's sad to see it go down
 But it was cool. We'll bring my kids there once before
 It's done and it just
 Reminded me of like that piece of my life and like how much effort and hard work and everything had to go into it
 For a goal and and it's funny because like wrestling is not like
 other sports
 Like it my high school like people liked basketball so basketball's upstairs and there's you know the body feel playing basketball
 Fun they get a drink and eat food never they want which is you know as if you know anything about wrestling
 We don't get to do that most of the time
 People actually show up to the matches or to the games for basketball
 Which doesn't happen to wrestling and wrestling we were down underneath the basketball court in this little time
 Really called the rubber room that smelled like rubber and sweat and kind of disgusting
 I loved it though mucking my lie
 and and and
 And we're doing it not because of like these you know
 We thought we were gonna get people to show up and like cheers on it was like it had to be an internal thing like I had
 Do is because I wanted this thing I wanted this goal and
 I think a lot of times it's very true. Sendings are true in entrepreneurship. I mean
 I say all the time fact I said at the award ceremony for the entrepreneur the year
 I said you know the entrepreneurship is the lonely shop in the world and so
 And wrestling similar like there's not fans coming out the girls don't line up with the wrestling matches to like cheer you on
 Which is not that way like you do wrestling because you love wrestling and I think entrepreneurship the same way
 You do entrepreneurship because you love being an entrepreneur you love serving people who love changing their lives and like that's that's
 That's the thing. That's the reason that's the motivation why you do it. I think
 You know I think it's the big reason why we here at ClickFunnels do like the two comma club and all these things is because I want to award
 The entrepreneur who is killing themselves in an effort to try to change their own lives
 and then afterwards change lives to their customers and
 Because it goes so unnoticed and unknown. I want to be the one to bring that up and so that's why we do mostly crazy stuff
 We do here
 Because I know it's like to to kill yourself in a pursuit of a worthy cause not having one notice
 Except for yourself and so it's kind of a nice thing to do and so the entrepreneur the year award was fun for me because it was like
 It was like a time for people to you know
 I I tried to recognize all other entrepreneurs all the time. It's fun to have a chance to be to be recognized and
 Anyway, and it's kind of reminding me back of the
 Wrestling same kind of thing. So in fact, I remember I my dad and I were talking about this
 So high school I was a state champ. I went to the nation to the national took second place in the nation. It was an all-American
 Highest level I think any athlete in my high school probably ever got to we get back in the end of the year
 They reward like the athlete of the year for our school and guess who got it?
 Some girl who didn't do anything like nothing wrong with the girl like I love that
 But like she she had like placed on a state-winning team in our high school and because she was the captain
 She got it. I was just like you kidding me like
 Just blows my mind and it's like
 Yeah, anyway, so sometimes entrepreneurship as is wrestling a loveless job, but it's it's amazing
 So anyway, I thought it was really cool and just want to kind of show out with you guys now one quick thing
 I want to share with you guys today because I was talking about this with a couple people that we can is
 interesting right now
 We are in the middle of an economic boom here in the United States of America
 I think real estate prices are high so they've ever been and right now it's tons of building construction all sorts of stuff right
 But I remember back in like if I'm sorry the UPS guys asking if he's okay parking behind me
 Oh people
 anyway
 I remember in like 2008 when the economy crashed right and after my 2008 till like
 I don't know for the next five or six years because the economy was was down it was
 I can't remember we hired people come work on our houses like the actually like owner of the company would show up
 He's like yeah, I just can't so much work left
 So here I am and he'd be doing the work and it was cool because they were hungry and they were like and like they they worked hard
 Because like all those kind of things right they showed up every day and they made sure that they had a good quality and all sorts of stuff
 And I and I like that a lot
 and now as the
 Economy is booming. It's like these companies grow they forget about the hard times they hire all these people on and it's like
 It's insane like you look at the quality of what's happening in the construction industry especially here in Boise
 I'm sure it's same everywhere like it's horrible like
 They don't care anymore because there's so many businesses so many jobs
 They just are running and burning and sure and you're making an insane amounts of money
 What they'll understand is that
 Things cycle like there's the ups and the downs. There's like it happens every business is gonna happen in my business again
 Like it happens for all of us right and so for them
 It's like they don't understand like they're up right now, but it's gonna come back down and it's like the
 The marketing they need to be doing right now is like
 Continuing to serve at a really high level when things are good because when it turns back around guess who we're gonna remember
 We remember people who serve at a high level
 The people that that that are doing that that are serving and not just like burning and churning and cash-dumping like they
 They they'll get the jobs when things get tough
 you know we had somebody that we paid to come do two big projects our office and also the whole project my home and
 I'm afraid like the most important thing is communication yet have good communication and
 It was insane how bad the communication was
 Anyway, I'm not gonna go into it because anyway
 The a bunch of really bad things happen in fact right now
 it's a year later and my floors are still warped because of
 Them not communicating with me or with the people doing harder floors and it's like all these things it's like right now
 We're about to start a project that's gonna be I don't know five or six million dollar bill project
 And it's like they're not getting that project because they're like oh things are so busy with so much stuff happening
 And I was like I don't care how busy you are like this is my project do I mean more busy because this is gonna happen
 I know your industry. I've seen the cycle. It's gonna crash. Just hoping to come down and guess what you're gonna be broken homeless and
 Looking for jobs and guess whose job you're not getting mine because you didn't you didn't serve me at the highest level when you didn't have to
 Right and so I just want to kind of say that because it's it's something that I
 Don't know what you guys are all gonna experience. You're gonna struggle
 You're gonna be amazing you're serve people highest level you're able to think and start getting successful
 It's having you know the fruits of your label labor will come your companies start growing and then
 You've got this option where you can like continue to try to do your best or you make you know what this person
 You know and it's kind of going this burn and share model
 It doesn't matter it's more business more work that I could ever do and I just want to remind you that I got cycle always comes back
 And like be a good person always try to serve your highest level all the time not just when times are tough
 If you do that one times are tough. They won't be tough
 So anyway, I hope you guys fill out from me and from our company
 We are always trying to serve our highest level all the time even though right now times are really really good for us
 Like the reason why they're really good is because we continue to do that we're continuing to try to over deliver on every single aspect every single step
 Everything we're doing and I know that by doing that. That's what
 It's gonna keep us around hopefully for forever and hopefully with downtime's hit
 You guys remember that you'll stay with us because you like man like they serve us when things were good
 They continue service from times are down and this is where we're gonna put our this is we're putting the eggs in this basket
 So think about if your company as well because I promise you guys
 It's all cyclical it all goes up and it all goes down and all goes up and it all goes down
 And if you are amazing when things are up you also be amazing with things are down
 All right, I'm out here and go working some fun stuff stuff. Appreciate you guys an amazing day and I will talk to you guys all soon
