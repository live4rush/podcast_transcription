 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing
 secrets podcast tonight we're gonna be hanging out and talking a little bit
 about the fact that nobody owes you anything and you should just be grateful
 for the opportunity. So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us
 who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our
 own pockets how do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our
 services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain
 profitable. That is the question and this podcast will give you the answers. My
 name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets.
 Alright so I'm gonna share with you guys some stuff tonight that I don't normally
 share and probably have a stuff I wanted to share normally or not and
 anyway I'm gonna go into that here in a minute but I want to share one idea
 that's completely not related marketing maybe it is. So right now I'm eating this.
 In fact I don't want to see this. If you guys are sitting here on my kitchen this
 is my dinner. I share this because right now I'm on this how to get ripped before
 a fun hacking live diet with with Bart Miller and it's been fun. He's got me
 working out doing all sorts of stuff but then also had me eating very specific
 way and I knew that there was no way I was gonna be able to stick with it. In
 fact the first day Dave and I, Dave's in it with me we went over to the grocery
 store and bought stuff and it was like 50 bucks for that one day just to eat
 stuff and it was like we just bought like packs of chicken breast and broccoli
 and that's you know it was horrible. And the second day like I brought turkey from
 Thanksgiving from you know a little bit ago and then Dave ran out of time to buy
 food so he literally had his son go and buy him packs of deli meat. It's so he's
 eating back some deli meat and by day two we will never actually do this because
 this is too hard to actually live this way which I'm sure is why a lot of people
 don't lose weight and probably other things you know if you don't do because
 it's too hard to consistently do it. So we went online we found someone here in
 Boise who cooks meals and so we gave her all the macros, microbes, all kind of
 stuff when it needs to be and then every day she literally makes us three meals
 drops them off in the morning and they're all perfectly cooked, fine-tuned, healthy
 with exactly that the carbs, macros, microbes, fats, proteins, everything that
 was perfect for what it's supposed to actually be. So that's our meat now, this is my
 third meal today and it's nice not to think just to grab and eat so I
 recommend for any of you guys and it's not that expensive. We're paying like
 300 bucks a week for this which if I was to go out one day a week that's way more
 300, for one meal week that's way more than 300 bucks. This is three meals a day
 plus keeps me all I'm allowed to put him out is what she puts into the box is
 that's it. So just a thought, find some of the cooking meals for you and do other
 things that are keeping you from getting the goals you want. So all right so I
 digress what I want to share to you yesterday or tonight is pretty important
 I think. So it I wasn't sure one thing but there's just stories I can't tell so
 there's been like honestly three or four situations in the last like two
 weeks they have been insane. It's been probably some of the hardest two weeks of
 my life when it relates to like the negative sides of business and so for me
 it's been funny because I'm trying to like to block it and defend it because I
 just need to keep moving forward and the negativity of stuff can keep me or you
 or anybody from moving forward right. So I don't want to share those specific
 stories but the way that people dealt with them was really I don't think right.
 So believe it or not I'm not going to go deeper into it but I do want to share
 something that actually I want to share this not to brag that's not the point
 but to like show that I practice what I preach I don't just talk about stuff I
 actually believe it. I'm saying it's important and so that's the only reason
 I'm sharing this story and hopefully it'll help some of you guys to think about
 how you should deal with stuff in the future. So and maybe yeah hopefully it'll
 help at least somebody out there. So some of you guys know that a couple years
 ago there's a company that got launched called Prove it and I was part of the
 original team that helped launch that and I was the dude who wrote the
 script for the animated video. I had my animators animate the whole thing and
 that became a campfire video for anyone in that company and it exchanged me
 doing that initial stuff I negotiated some equity in the company. The equity right
 now looking at where the company has blown up for the last three years is
 worth insane amount of money. Well over eight figures and probably closer well
 it's insanely low and I negotiate ahead of time and then I was gonna do a bunch
 of other things for the company and just for some reason some of these didn't
 work because it was just it was hard within the company. Network marketing
 companies software makes it hard to do some of the funnels and things I was
 planning on helping with. So that was kind of hard and then ClickFunnels was
 taking off at the same time so I was focusing there and just when all
 said and done like at the end of the day I didn't do what I thought I was gonna
 do but what I did have is this really cool fancy thing called a contract that
 I had signed. It said I owned extra cent of the company and but and the
 situation with the multiple people this week it was not the same situation
 something kind of like that and it was like where people didn't pull their
 load and then they're like demanding this justice which was
 unjust because they didn't do anything and it's like it makes me so angry and
 frustrated and so I was thinking about myself and I was like I'm in the same
 situation here like based on what I negotiated three years ago I own
 X% of this company and well that's awesome and it's worth insane amount of
 money if I'm completely honest with myself it is not fair not to me it's not
 fair to them and if I was in their situation I would I know in my mind I'd
 be annoyed by me all the time or thought me like man Russell got this thing and
 he did this little thing up front and then I went from him in the last three
 years he was on things, ran his own direction and instead of just like being
 like I got the contract you owe me I won't actually actively reached out to
 them and said hey I don't feel like I deserve this
 and Brian who's the owner of the company of course he's like no no no you told
 you don't I don't and I'm okay with that like I thought I was gonna be doing
 this and this for this movement and I didn't I wasn't able to some things
 were because the technical things didn't connect
 on the funnel side and sometimes because I just had to have time and I didn't do
 what I was supposed to do and um and I was like it's not fair to you and I
 don't want someday when you sell this thing to be mad at me or angry at me
 when you have to give me a huge check because I didn't deserve it and I didn't
 earn it and I don't want it and he was like well this is kind of weird he's
 like well what do you want and I was like for what I did like I think this is
 what would would make sense and it's literally like me giving back
 eight figures with the cash and just being like here you go and taking
 something way less because that's what I actually earned and that's what I
 deserve and um I think he was kind of confused and then he said okay and now
 we're making the transition the shift away and I'm signing away my equity in
 exchange for something way less because that's what I actually earned when I
 actually deserve okay so that's um that's what I want you
 guys to start thinking about and doing like don't
 like in a situation with a business partner or a friend or an employer or
 like whatever it is like get where you actually deserve but don't get
 more like don't I don't know there's weird things in society where people
 think they deserve everything and it's ridiculous it's insane like I
 wouldn't believe some of these things that didn't happen in the last two
 weeks but it's insane what people feel like they deserve
 even though they don't deserve it because of something they feel like
 they did and it's just it's so infuriating I mean I remember I had a
 chance to hear this guy speak a little while ago named
 Nido Quabain if you guys have never heard of him he is like one of the best
 speakers I've ever heard I'm probably seven or eight
 probably a long time ten years ago now at a Dan Kennedy event and he was I think
 he's like the CEO or something of Wonder Bread a bunch of other things and he's
 an entrepreneur and he basically came over he came to the country with like
 $20 in his pocket and built his huge empire and just awesome dude and I guess
 in the speech I'm pulling a slaughter because this is a decade ago I heard and
 I don't remember all the details but I do remember the feeling I got in the
 message but he talked about how he basically got a job as the
 the I don't know what they call him in college like he was in charge of the
 dean of or call anyway he was in charge of this college right
 and it was this college was struggling he was coming in to turn it around and he
 came in the first day or first week he worked with me how to the first week
 and then he came in they handed him a paycheck and he said what's this for and
 he said this is your paycheck he's like well I haven't done anything yet and
 like well you get paid every two weeks it's how it works so they gave him the
 check and he sat on his desk like I did not earn that
 and then he kept working he worked next two weeks so they came in to get
 next paycheck he's like what is this for like that's your paycheck he's like I
 didn't earn that he put it down and he kept trying his
 his job his role was to transform the university kept doing that kept trying
 and it took him a while because it's a big thing to do and eventually I can't
 remember a year two years three years later whatever was he transformed this
 university and had this big impact and at a time like I think somebody said
 come in his office and he had a stack um you know five or six inches tall
 of these envelopes and so instead of the way what's that big stack he said
 those are the paychecks they keep giving me but I haven't earned him yet so I'm
 not gonna like they're they're not mine and I remember hearing that and just
 being like like that's the right attitude like I don't know
 as opposed to the other situations where it's like you try to like slip your
 way in and then if you know that you want you try to sue somebody or you try
 to like get a contract signed and try to sneak and then you stop doing what
 you're you you committed to doing or whatever that thing is just like
 it's insane to me and like I said it's happened
 four times four times in the last
 six weeks yeah dang the people have done that where
 they're where they feel like there's something and so they're threatening
 to sue where they feel like they're deserved something and because they
 had a contract they didn't actually do what they committed to doing like all
 these things and it's just so frustrating to me it's like that's
 not how I want to be remembered I want to be remembered remember as a person who
 actually earned like I got what I earned and I showed up and I did what I said
 I was gonna do and if I didn't say what I was gonna do then I didn't take what
 I it's contractually signed you because the contract said because I know inside
 my heart that I broke the contract I didn't do what I said I was gonna do
 okay and so and I want somebody who wants to come in and try to get
 what's not mine through threats and through all these things it's just
 ridiculous okay I want to be the kind of person who
 someday I can tell my kids I can tell my grandkids hopefully someday
 you know a thousand years from now someone's gonna launch his podcast someone
 in my posterity and be like wow great great great great great great
 grandpa Brunson he was a man of integrity he actually did what he said
 he was gonna do and when he didn't earn something he didn't contractually trick
 somebody they got well we got a contract so it kind of sucks like yeah
 no I freaking gave it back to him because I didn't earn it and I took what I did
 earn and I hope that I don't hope that rings true to
 some of you guys if it does it'll be worth the
 rent for tonight and so I hope it does and if you haven't learned any of you
 equi-baing speak I'm gonna try I bought a bunch of his stuff back in the day I
 wonder if I can find that presentation where he talked about that because it was
 so impactful me just to hear that and realize that like that's how we should
 be working like just because the rest of the world the shows up to work you know
 follows us sleeping it's a check every two weeks like us the people who are
 producers who are moving forward like that's not how we should look at things
 we should be okay with that when our teams do that we should be okay without
 people around us doing that like we need to earn what we earn and go out there
 and do the thing and that's that's that's the goal right and if you do
 work your butt off and you do do the thing you do earn the money then be proud of
 it they don't hide it me embarrassed like you actually
 worked your butt off you deserve it but don't do the way around where you
 where you trick cheat scam lie whatever it takes to get what you think is yours
 because it's not yours you don't actually deserve it
 okay you should just be grateful for the opportunity and so that's
 where I'm leaving this one off I'm grateful for the opportunity to prove he
 gave me I'm excited it's funny like I should be so like sick to my stomach
 about it but I have no issues like I'm so excited to be giving back
 this equity and exchange to give something that's really cool that
 that's a good fit like that it's anyway it's just it's it's good and I feel
 good about it and I'm gonna sleep really really good tonight because of that
 and that's what really matters and so hopefully that helps somebody
