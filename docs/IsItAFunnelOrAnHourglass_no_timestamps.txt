 Hey everybody, this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast today
 I'm really excited because I'm gonna actually be sharing with you guys a video from behind the scenes of the inner circle meeting
 So some you guys know Annie Grace and our community who is one of my favorite people she?
 She shared something at fun at the inner sloshed in a circle meeting talking about
 A funnel versus an hourglass and it had such a profound impact on me. I want to republish it here
 So that said when Cuban theme song when we come back
 I will share with you guys that that that video and that message and I hope you guys love it
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everyone, all right, so we are back right now
 We're gonna move to the next segment of the show which I'm really side forces called tales of a funnel hacker
 This is where I'm pulling out really cool on stories in the community
 you sometimes are people who
 Who speak a funnel hiking live a major minor circle?
 Maybe I hung out with them at the restaurant
 There's just a cool story that I want to share and this one is someone who
 Doesn't I'm sharing this yet, so I'm kind of excited
 But the other you guys know I have my own inner circle coaching program. It's $50,000 a year
 We had a hundred people in it and this year actually shut it down
 Which if you listen to the marketing secrets podcast you've heard that story before
 Which was a really hard and painful thing for me shut down
 But it was something we needed to do to focus on on where we're going but
 Basically every single entrepreneur that group gets to come and they have a 30 minutes on stage here in our office to present what they're doing
 They're business and stuff like that and I want to share with you guys a little clip from my friend Annie Grace
 she is
 one of my favorite people in our inner inner circle and
 She she shared something that had such a huge profound impact on me
 I remember after she said I just sat there I was like oh my gosh
 I kept thinking about the next day I thought about it next day I had her like
 There's another group that came in I had like retell it again and I want to share it again because it's such a big
 important thing
 For those who don't know Annie Annie
 She's written a bunch of her books. I can't tell you I have another cool announcement her I can't announce yet, but
 Yeah, I can't yeah, no, okay, I was got trouble anyway
 She's awesome, but I'm sure a book called the alcohol experiment
 She has one called the naked mind and she helps people to break the chains of alcohol addiction
 And her books are amazing even if you're not addicted to alcohol
 They can help you break the chains of any addiction because helps you understand
 The psychology behind it and NLP and all the all the stuff that affects your brain that gets you the causes and addiction
 And she is just an amazing person who's changing someone people's lives and and in her circles
 She's talking about her business and she's trying to help all these people and she's talking about she's got a certification program coming and all these
 Things they're doing and you know
 She's got she's selling thousands you know thousands of copies of her books and she's on TV and like all these things that are happening
 And I think sometimes we're all excited, but then you see like man
 I'm selling my things not everybody's having success and you get frustrated and they're like there's always that that piece of it and
 This insight she shared
 Has such a profound impact on me. I wanted to share it yet. So I'm gonna show this clip
 It's about two minutes long. You guys want to see it right now
 This is from Annie Grace during her inner circle presentation this year
 Really I have been struggling a lot with this idea of a funnel since the very beginning on a personal perspective
 So, you know
 I've sold multiple hundreds of thousands of books and I'm like oh my gosh of all those you know 250,000 bucks
 How many people actually read it right and then how many people do they finish it and then how many people does it touch and how many people?
 And it gets so small to the point where like the people who need you and the people you're impacting feel so so so small and
 So Brian was like well
 It's kind of like the parable of the sewer like you you sprinkle the seed and some of it falls on
 It's just how the universe works some of it's gonna get choked out some of it's going to you know spring up
 Some of it's gonna do these things like okay. It's just how the universe works
 I just have to make peace with this idea and
 We just opened the stake at mine Institute where we've certified
 Coaches to go and kind of do this work in the world and I was driving back from that training
 I just dropped my team off at the airport and I was really thinking about that
 I was like oh my gosh even in that room
 You know 60 people came but like how many of them are actually gonna create these businesses that do something and go somewhere in the world
 And it's just gonna get smaller and smaller and there's probably only gonna be like five of them that are like the breakout people that impact other people
 And then all of a sudden I just remembered the second part of that first
 It was like but the seeds that actually spring up will reproduce
 30 60 hundred times and so all of a sudden I saw that it's not a funnel
 It's an hourglass and I I wanted to share that because that's what Russell's doing, too
 Right like it's there's you know of all the people Russell touches
 There's only a few but then you look at the people in this room and and we're the hourglass you guys were the people who are like
 And then the next thing I wanted to share I think so good for me and it's it's something that like I remind myself of all the time
 as entrepreneurs we are as Alex Yarfens has momentum based beings we are forward focused we want the next thing we are going to the next place and
 A practice that like I I do and and something that just really speaks true to me
 Is is this quote and I think if we can just say this to ourselves and have the tension of wanting the next thing
 But also knowing that in this moment we have arrived in this moment
 We are here in this moment our destination is in each step and each moving forward
 It's so powerful and sometimes when you just get stressed and thinking about the next thing just remember like we've already arrived
 You guys were already here. This is the stuff. So I wanted to share those things
 Whoo isn't that an awesome message. I think that
 You know, I've felt that sometimes before which is like man
 We're doing all these things where try we're spending so much money to put our voice out there our message out there and and
 Sometimes it is discouraging when you look at it like call but like, you know, we sold
 You know, I see people a lot of times in the the ClickFunce Facebook group like there's 250,000 people there
 Why is only a hundred thousand members? What's wrong with everybody else or you know, like we sold out of you know three or four hundred thousand copies of
 The of the dot-com secret secrets books and site
 But why like how in the house only a hundred thousand members and from those members like how many are having success and like and you look at that
 And it can be it can be frustrating sometimes and then when she pointed that out and said no
 It's not a it's not a funnel. It's an hourglass that the people who do take hold those are ones that grow like that's
 That's what gives you the inspiration
 That's really what I think for all of us like our calling is to go out there and be as loud as we can put our voice out there put our products
 our services like putting it out there and
 And and try to change the make people's license possible, but the ones you do touch the ripple effect from that
 That's why we that's why we do this
 And so anyway, I hope that that helps any of you guys who are who bring going through this process who may be struggling or maybe
 Maybe you haven't figured out like like you know
 I think especially like if you guys taking the disc profile like I'm very high ROI like is that my highest value
 I need to see return investment routes. I don't want to do it for any of you guys
 You sometimes get frustrated like I created this video
 I posted it and like 13 people watched it or whatever had you know in your frustrates
 It's like you're not getting the traction you want yet. It's like this okay
 Like you have to keep putting the message out there and keep putting out and keep putting out there because you're sewing all these seeds
 You're sewing all these seeds and the right people are gonna find it. They're gonna hear your message
 They're gonna take that thing and that's what's gonna blossom. That's what's gonna change the world. And so
 That's my my message to you guys from Annie and
 I'm gonna continue through marketing series live to try to find some of these cool experiences like that where there was 30 people in the
 Room there with Annie that heard that but it's like something I want to share with the entire world
