 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson. I'm gonna welcome you to the marketing secrets podcast
 I've got a really special episode actually next four episodes are kind of some special episodes
 I want to share with you guys that things you're gonna love so let's get into it
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so on this first episode I want to give you some backstory on what's happening why I made these four special episodes for you
 So right now inside ClickFunnels we are working towards our big viral video launch on the 15th
 And with that we're trying to change a whole bunch of things fix the all-moreing process making simpler and simpler for people
 Because if we get a huge influx of customers especially people who don't really know our marketing understand
 What funnels are how they're doing it like we have to really simplify the process. That's what we're doing a simplification of
 This whole thing. I don't know if you've noticed our light click from support
 It's gotten so much better
 We shifted from it was taking on hours like a little less than an hour to get to get live response now
 We're like a three-minute medium and so it's like
 So many cool things we've been doing trying to prepare for this thing
 Which is now like two weeks away for some kind of stressful not gonna lie and one of the cool things we're having is this really cool gaming
 badging systems when somebody comes in to
 At the ClickFunnels there's like the this game of fire like onboarding process for doing things and moving throughout it and
 It's gonna be really really cool. So by the time some years of listening this it'll actually be live
 So you can go and see it
 But in there, you know a couple things with ClickFunnels like ClickFunnels we're teaching how to use the software
 But also people have to understand the marketing behind it or else they don't they're not gonna be successful with the software
 Which is kind of interesting and so I tried to think how do I teach all this funnel psychology and stuff in a very short compressed period of time
 And so we did that with one of the little badges that people will win
 Here inside of inside of the onboarding process. So that's kind of what's what's going down, right?
 And so with that I basically created four different videos
 that are the core foundational things to get people
 Onboarded to understand the marketing behind funnels very very quickly very rapidly
 So that's what these episodes are about is I'm actually gonna just play those four video clips now in the video clips
 I'll say I click down the button down below and and you're gonna get the sing over here and see your homework assignment
 So just know that those are from the onboarding process
 If you actually want to get the homework assignments if you want to see the things or I'd talk about you do
 You have to actually log into ClickFunnels and go to the onboarding just to get those
 But I want you to understand because I think hopefully made sense
 We'll find out maybe makes no sense
 But I tried to really simplify the process of four core things that are the four things really understand number one is like why
 Do we have funnels like why is that important number two is the value ladder a lot of times you think about value ladder from like
 From like a high level like first
 I'm gonna book and then I'm gonna have an event and then we're gonna do one-on-one coaching
 But I want to talk about value out from a from a micro standpoint
 So the macros looks like landing page like why do you how do you give value on that?
 And then what's the value on the the sales page and then the upsell page like how do you do that?
 So we go into the value ladders video number two number three
 Then how to create offer which is something so funny like in my mind I
 Think this is common sense to me or intuitive or I've done so long
 I don't think about this but it seems like as we're gonna do the two comical coaching the one of the biggest problems and questions people
 Have the Stephen deals with every day is like how do we create an offer and and so I've never really talked about it
 I guess I assume I think I assumed it people understood and I found out now that I don't so I go deep into like how to create an actual offer
 Which I think was cool. Hopefully hopefully it's getting maybe it's lame
 But hopefully it turned out good to help you understand like oh, that's what I need me doing
 I'm creating lots and lots of offers like that's the key this whole thing and then the four step was understanding copywriting
 It's copywriting is like the last layer is how you actually present the offer
 So we have why do you need a funnel and then inside the funnel like what is the value you're providing each step inside the funnel?
 And then from there what's the offer that you've created each step inside the funnel to actually provide that value and then the last one is
 The copywriting which is how you actually sell the offer which provides the value
 Which is how you get someone through your funnel?
 Whoa, that's kind of cool. So anyway, that's what I'm sure yes, so over the next four episodes
 We're gonna go with that so this first one we're talking about why do we need a funnel?
 And some of you guys obviously been funnel hackers forever
 You know this stuff some of you guys maybe like what the dump is Russell talking about and so that's what we're gonna talk
 Right now is why funnels?
 I'm sure you has that clip and that'll be what's happening here on this episode of the marketing seekers podcast
 Hey, this Russell again and today I'm excited because today we're not just talking about click funnels
 Which is one of the coolest things in the world but for you to really utilize click funnels and really have success from it
 I think it's vitally important that you not only get good at using the software and using the tool
 But you actually become a marketer click funnels was built by marketers like me
 For marketers to build a market their products and their services and sometimes you people come in and they have a product
 They have a service they want to sell and they throw in the click phones
 They build a funnel and they're like nobody's buying it nobody's coming to my thing
 No one's giving their email. I just like why not it's because it's not just something you put out there and hope that the best happens
 It's something where you have to understand the marketing behind it
 And so what I want to do during this walkthrough is to help you understand some of the core
 Fundamental concepts of marketing that are essential for your success inside of funnels
 Okay, because if you understand these things that when you're building funnels your funnels become profitable
 But actually make money and you have success with click funnels
 And that's our number one goal for you. So that's kind of game plan
 So to kind of step back
 Because I know that a lot of people in the first getting click funnels
 They don't even know what a funnel is so depending on where you're at either you may know exactly what it is
 You have kind of a hazy idea or you have no idea at all
 Most people obviously have heard of a website, right?
 When I got started in this business 15 years ago
 Websites were the thing and it's funny because I remember back then everybody would come and they would say
 You're like oh do you think I need a website?
 Like everyone's talking about websites I get one and now we kind of laugh at that because they you know like there's no
 Business, I don't think that doesn't have a website you have to have a website to exist
 And so we just kind of assume it now and that's kind of what funnels are today funnels are the future
 Like they are the evolution of websites. It's where everything is going as people always ask me like well
 Do I need a funnel for my business?
 And I was kind of chuckle because they don't understand the strategy when they do it's like oh wow like there's no
 Point to a website the only thing I need is a funnel like it's it's where everything's going and so that's all I want to really
 Help you guys to understand and so I think the best way for you guys to really understand this
 I'm gonna tell you guys a story about how I kind of got it and when you understand this it should hopefully make more sense inside of your
 Business so first core concept you have to understand I learned this initially from one of my very first
 Marketing mentors names Dan Kennedy and he said this whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins
 now when I first heard that it didn't make perfect sense to me I was like that doesn't make any sense why I don't want to spend a
 Whole bunch money and and I remember hearing that and just didn't really resonate with me
 but
 Bear with me as I share this story with you. It's gonna make it's gonna
 You're gonna find out like this is the key most important thing to understand in business in marketing in funnels
 Whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. So let me tell you my story
 So when I got started in this business back 15 years ago
 I was in high school and I built my very first website selling potato guns now. I had created information product
 I set up a website
 I'd done my best and back then the way that everybody got traffic to the websites is by using a website called Google
 So I went to Google I started buying my very first Google Ads now as a college student
 I didn't have a ton of money
 So I was able to invest about ten dollars a day into Google Ads and the good thing for me is I was selling this DVD for
 $7 and what happens on average for every ten dollars?
 I'd spend I'd sell about one DVD so you do the math on that I was
 Spending ten dollars making thirty seven dollars. I had twenty seven dollars profit that was putting inside of my pocket now
 What happened is a little while later Google shifted their algorithm and kind of changed how how things work and the price for every
 Single click started going up and got bigger and bigger and bigger now
 What happened is one day I woke up and the ads that I was running were exactly the same
 I was getting the same amount of clicks same amount of people my website
 But now instead of spending ten dollars a day to give the same amount of traffic. I was spending fifty dollars a day now
 If you do the math on that you spend fifty dollars a day you make thirty seven dollars a day
 I was losing thirteen dollars every single day because of my website now
 I know about you
 But I really quickly my wife and I realized we couldn't keep doing that and stay in business after four or five days
 I had to turn off my website and it was over for me and unfortunately for me and for so many entrepreneurs
 That's where most entrepreneurial dreams die is in you're spending money. You can't be profitable and they just fall
 It's apart okay, and I started learning this lesson
 Whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. I couldn't spend more than thirty seven dollars a day because all I was making
 I was capped at that and that's if I just wanted to break even and so
 A few months later, I had a friend who was in a similar business to me and he called me up
 He said hey Russell. I think I figured out the secret he said I started adding upsells to all of my products
 And I was like, what do you mean it upselling said?
 Well, it's kind of like McDonald's you've been to McDonald's like yeah
 I said you know when they offer you a hamburger and I said yeah
 I said you know that for them to sell that hamburger actually lose money the money for the ads and the promotion the marketing actually
 Lose money so silly hamburger for like two or three bucks
 And it costs them four or five dollars to get you there in the drive-in
 They said and they added this little sentence on there and said hey
 Would you like fries and a coke with that and the majority people say oh yeah sure throw that in there
 And they did that the fries and the coke was where they make their money
 So they spend you know three or four dollars to get someone there they sell a hamburger for two dollars
 They lose the dollar they add fries and a coke and all of a sudden boom they're profitable
 And we said that like the light bulb went off my head and I said okay
 Well, how do I do this and so he showed me his website?
 He had similar websites to me selling little information products and he said look
 What I did is I started having upsells trying to sell the next thing that someone would need if they bought my first product
 And I said well how did I work for my potato guns?
 I don't know he said well when somebody buys a potato gun DVD
 What's the next thing that they need?
 I was like well you know next thing that they buy the pipes and the glue and the barbecue ignite and all those pieces that
 You have to go to the store to get and so you should make a kit and just upsell the kit
 And so I was lucky I found someone up in Northern Idaho who actually sold potato gun kits
 And we did a partnership and started adding those as upsells
 And so I transitioned my my little website into my very first funnel
 I didn't know that's what it was called at the time
 But it was a funnel so somebody would buy my DVD and then the next page we'd upsell them a potato gun kit
 Now if you look at the math and how this all worked I was still spending $50 a day on Google that didn't change
 They didn't lower their prices for me. They were still charging the same amount and I was still averaging about one sell a day of my DVD
 So I was only making $37 so I was actually losing money
 But then what was cool was that one out of every three people who bought my DVD ended up buying my upsell and buying my kit
 You look at a math and that my kit was $197 that means one out of three means
 I made an extra $65 for every DVD I sold that means I spent $50 a day and I was making a hundred two dollars a day
 So we do the math behind that I was actually making fifty two dollars every single day
 Now that is when the whole light bulb went off my head
 I was like that that's the secret like if I can spend more money to acquire customer than I win
 And that's when I realized that websites made me broke but funnels actually made me money now as I started my career after I did that
 I started getting excited started realizing like wow
 There's so many ways to do funnels and I can put funnels into any business and I started doing that
 I started going into really competitive markets where there's tons of competition and I would look and I would see these people all
 Ahead of the website selling the product and I would take that concept and I would go match our adding upsells and downsells and adding different things in there
 And I start competing against these people and what's crazy is they could spend you know
 however many dollars a day they could spend an advertising I could spend two or three times as much money and still make more money and
 Very quickly I started beating out all my competitors in every market we went into and that's when I realized just like
 Dan Kennedy told me that whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins and that's why funnels are so important
 especially if you're struggling in your business right now if you're of a business and you're break even or you're losing some money a
 Funnel is the secret. That's what gets you from breaking even to becoming profitable if you're doing well
 But you want to grow a funnel is the secrets how you start taking your business and scaling it make more money for every single person
 Who comes into your into your funnel?
 Okay
 The funnels are the secrets are growing businesses and getting your message your products your services out into the world
 And so that's why we're so excited about funnels
 So why don't you understand the concepts behind those things now?
 Obviously there are lots of different types of funnels as you learned in the earlier walkthrough
 Inside the cookbook we had 22 different types and so some of the funnels are specifically for selling a product
 Okay, like like my potato gun DVD where I sold the DVD then I absolutely potato gun kit some some funnels aren't for that some funnels are for generating lead
 Then you can send emails to them and sell them things in the future
 Some are to generate applications you can call them on the phone some are some are funnels to get people into your actual location
 It doesn't really matter different funnels for different situations
 But all the funnels is something we were taking somebody you're taking them through this process to get the end result
 And what's interesting is that I think a lot of people think the funnels are this mysterious thing yet
 It's happening every single day right now in fact if you run an offline business
 I promise you already have a funnel it may be a really really bad one
 But you have one think about it
 So say you're a chiropractor or a dentist or something right somebody sees an ad they drive by to see your billboard at
 See your place they get a referral something right and they come to your location and walk up to your door
 What's the first thing they do they open the door right and they walk in now something's happening to they're coming into this funnel now
 They're greeted by somebody could be your front desk receptionist or whoever right and they're saying something
 They're trying to get them to schedule an appointment or set up a call or whatever the thing might be and then it after that
 Happens and they take them to the next step and the next step and every business has it
 There's some kind of funnels some kind of process you're taking thing people through all the time and the online funnels are the same thing
 People think it's something different, but it's not it's if I'm driving an ad from Facebook
 They're gonna come somewhere to a page and maybe that page are triasps or email address
 Maybe I'm selling them a product or I'm taking them down this path just like I would if I was selling somebody face-to-face
 So the cool thing about funnels is it's not something new or different that you're not used to it's the same thing you're used to
 It's just in an online format and we start realizing that you start realizing that funnels are happening everywhere around you
 And for me
 I start noticing him over and over and he gets me so excited to see it and now it's coming back like
 How do I do this for my business online and so that's kind of the game
 I'm gonna be walking through a lot more of these things
 Through the next through the next training videos down below, but I want you to understand that's what a funnel is
 I want you to understand the one core concept say whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins
 That's how you grow a company. That's how you beat your competitors. That's how you sell more products
 That's how you get your ads more out there
 That's how like all the things that you want business all come off of that concept
 Whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins and the way you're able to spend more money profitably is by having a funnel
 So I hope at this point
 I've sold you on funnels they are the key to everything in life least related to business and so I hope you understand that so with that said
 Your assignment right now is just to kind of think through that and understand that and understand the power and importance of funnels
 And thinking about your existing business think about the business right now
 Let's say you do have a regular website
 How do you take this thing with all these things? How do you restructure them into an actual funnel?
 Okay, well where are you seeing funnels right now if you have a regular business?
 Are you seeing you see the funnel right now?
 Like what does that look like like what's the process somebody's coming through and then what can you do to fix those things and
