 Hey everybody, this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing secrets podcast if you can tell right now the sound is
 Insanely good is because I am in recording studio reading the traffic secrets the dot-com secrets and then the expert secrets books
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out of the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everyone hope you guys are doing awesome
 So I'm in the middle of recording all the audiobooks which as painful as writing a book is recording an audiobook might be more painful
 It is really hard to like stay excited and keep your energy levels up and like and all these things while you're reading
 390,000 word books, which is really stupid that I look at it that way. It's funny the guy who's doing the audio engineering stuff
 He's like some people will read like one audiobook in their lifetime, but nobody reads three in a week
 So that's where we are right now and as funny as we were driving here today
 I was so tired and we're talking about starving artists and I'm like man. I'm not a starving artist
 I am just a tired artist so I think I think when you first get started your starving artist trying to figure out how in the world
 To actually make money and then eventually you figure that out
 And then you're just a tired artist because you can't keep up with all of the all the stuff that's happening and all of the
 The opportunities and the things that you start creating and start figuring out your voice. So
 anyway, as I was going today through
 the I'm about halfway through my exchange page
 214 in the
 The expert or the dot-com secrets book. I started reading expert or sorry
 I started reading traffic secrets first because that one is the next book we're selling and then going back and over the new dot-com secrets
 And about halfway through that right now. So that's right in the process halfway through all three books
 And I was reading it was kind of fun because you forget about these lessons that you know
 I wrote the the dot-com secrets books six years ago
 And I kind of forget about some of the lessons and one of the ones that got me re-excited as I was reading it
 I was like oh my gosh like I talked about this
 I did it for a while I haven't been consistent with it was this concept of daily sign felt emails and
 It's interesting because I think so many times we're we see here. We're trying to figure out. Okay. What's the what's the what's the email
 I said what am I gonna say? What's it gonna look like and we freak out and we get so caught up in like the
 They try to figure out the right message that we have to times don't even publish anything
 It was interesting at fun liking live behind the scenes. I was sitting there
 It's after is after Garrett White spoke on stage and me him and Todd were backstage talking about stuff and talking about
 funnels and complexity and it was funny because
 Garrett had had temporarily moved his email stuff to some other provider
 away from action X over to to on report I think and
 And we kind of asked my why do that
 He said well
 We did it because we wanted to add all these things that actually I didn't do and he started talking about all the different features
 and the things he wanted to add a ton of complexity to to his autoresponder sequences and
 I went and you move it over. It's like a year ago Michael
 How's how's it going?
 He's like well like nothing's working like we haven't even done it yet and Todd starts laughing
 He's like that's the problem everyone has they sit down
 They want to build these insanely complex funnels and follow up funnels and messaging and sequences and so they spend months
 Mapping all these things where they never actually get anything done. Most of them never actually go live they keep looking they want the
 the shiny whistle they want the the
 you know the the the the the hack the technique the thing that you know that all the millions of features but the reality is
 The reason why people have been successful click funnels so far is because it's simple
 Right like you can't build a funnel to eight thousand different variations
 Like you build very linear like five page funnels and eight page funnels and seeing things that are very very simple
 right
 It's we force people to like have simplicity and then because of that both people have success whereas other platforms like give you unlimited
 Complexity ability check. Oh my gosh is amazing. I can do a billion things
 But then because you have so much complexity you never do anything and we have the same thing we were
 We were looking at all the different segments inside of click funnels right?
 There's like people who who started trial, but then they cancel people who started trial mistake for month and they leave and you have
 People who fill in step one of the order form and then they leave people who have been on for a month
 and all these different segments right of click funnels users and and so
 Almost a year ago. We sat down said okay, and we want to write different different messaging segments for each of these lists
 Right so somebody is on a positive count. What's the sequence?
 We're gonna use to get them to to re upgrade their account
 So if we sat and we mapped out like I think it was like nine or ten different segments and all these even email sequences right
 Hey, we're gonna go do that
 But because it was so big and so complex we never did and in fast forward six months later
 We had an ex you know funnel marketing retreat. We sat down and said okay, you know
 How's those things going right? Well, we saw them done them and like why not like well, it's too complex
 So we said okay, let's do it again
 So we map them all out again went back to drawing board in the last six months
 We still haven't do them so then we went hired this team to do a force
 So like we can't even get these out the door
 Let's hire somebody else to do a force right so hire them
 And first the news they map out the same thing we mapped out 200 200 times
 And then they start saying well for each email
 We need to be able to split test emails and different headlines and action next doesn't do this yet
 So then they're trying to get us to recode action next add and split testing all these things and finally like we're two months in
 And Todd's like we don't even have an email yet like let alone emails to split test
 Like why don't we just make this simple and just put them in and just do it
 Like just stop trying to make everything so complex
 I just use it the way it's supposed to be be built and so we did we had them write emails we plugged them in and there's no
 Split testings are nothing but guess what emails are going out. Oh my gosh a year and two months later
 We finally have the thing out and I think that so many times we get so complex those things now
 Look at in the dot-com secrets book
 You know six years ago when I wrote this book initially and the strategy was so simple somebody joined your list
 Take them on a soap opera sequence to build a relationship with you when they finish that sequence
 They drop into a broadcast list we send out daily broadcast
 Telling stories about what's happening in your current life right now and you tie the story somehow back into your
 Into whatever you're selling and that's it. It's simply wake every morning. That's it
 I was telling my team this last week
 I said, you know if if I look at all the things I do in a day
 Right like I'm being the CEO and I'm writing books and I'm creating content and I'm tweeting and
 videoing and
 Instagramming and all the things right there's like a million things
 I'm doing every single day all these things are critical
 You look at like what's the one thing that I can do every single day that actually makes the most amount of money for me in the company?
 It would be to send out a daily sign filled email like to email a million plus people
 A message that gets them re-remind about why they should use click funnels and builds a relationship with me like that's there's nothing more valuable than that
 Yet, I haven't done it consistently for since we launched click funnels
 So spend five plus years since I've done the one thing that'll probably be the most
 profitable thing that I could possibly do and the reason why is because we keep trying to build up all this complexity in our
 Sequences and like if someone buys this and we're in the valley ladder
 They move they go from here to here and like all this stuff and we've been talking about it for years literally years and none of the things are live yet
 And so this is my commitment to myself to go back to simplicity
 It's a commitment that Garrett made to me at fun hacking live after we talked about this
 He said I'm calling my guys up all my guys who have been begging me for all these insane features
 They've moved everything on our platform over to and now nothing's happening. We're going back to simplicity
 We're moving everything back. We're gonna focus on simplicity
 So Garrett made that commitment to me
 I'm making the commitment to you and to my team and to everybody like we're gonna go back to simplicity
 And so my message for you guys today is that stop focusing on the complexity
 The complexity keeps you from actually finishing the project ever and this is not just in business
 It's very true business, but it's also true in all aspects of life, right in your in your relationships in your
 family life in your
 Just all the things we're doing. I think a lot of times we get to these
 These super complex things. I think about spiritually - like I have I know like if I woke up every morning
 I read the scriptures and that was like my number one thing that's the most important thing I could do
 My life would be a lot better
 But instead I have these complexities of all the things I got to do to try to like
 You know get closer to God or to be more spiritual whatever it is. They are so complex that keeps me forever doing it
 What's the simple thing? What's the very simple thing you can do that actually has the biggest impact in your life and start thinking about in all different areas
 Your life like in your personal life in your relationship in your business in your marketing like whatever the thing is
 If you could water it all down and only get it done one thing each day would be the most vital most valuable most important thing
 And then just do that and then maybe just take the rest of the day off
 I don't know depends on you or then do the second thing after that then take the rest of the day off
 But anyway, hopefully help somebody out there again
 Complexity is the killer of us having success and so simplify things and I promise you I
 Promise you things will things will be better for you
 So hope it helps
