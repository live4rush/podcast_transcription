 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to the market secrets podcast on today's episode
 I'm gonna talk to you as about how to get yourself and others past the initial pain so you can get to desire fast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital?
 We're spending money from our own pockets
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast will give you the answers my name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Okay, so today I want to talk to you about something that I was actually just having conversation with John here
 My office a few minutes ago and it came up. He was talking about and John is the guy on our team that runs off our traffic
 He's amazing and he he was a ballroom dancer growing up in high school and in college
 and right now his kids just started learning how to dance and
 We were talking about that a little bit and he said it's probably like you you're teaching your kids how to wrestle right now
 How excited you get watching them and then we started talking about just how hard is it first though?
 Like when my kids and also be first started wrestling
 The very first it's not fun
 Right because you're bad and you go out there and you get beat up by a lot of other kids and they don't in wrestling
 It's not nice. They beat on you and it's really bad where and John's talking about dance the same thing you go out there
 It's like you're really bad at first and so
 looking at ourselves as coaches right because
 If you listen to my recent podcast like as you grow in your company you go for me an entrepreneur to me a coach of coaching your
 Your team right that's how the progression grows as you try to scale a company
 And so I'm looking a lot at how do we coach how do we coach
 You know how do I coach my team better and also how do I coach my kids in wrestling right and
 It's interesting because like when somebody first starts a process is not fun
 Right in fact usually sucks at first
 It doesn't matter if it's wrestling or dance or if it's Facebook ads or if it's building a funnel
 Whatever there's like this part at the beginning that sucks
 We have to like get through the initial like pain right you have to get through
 The pain of like learning and trial and air and like that frustration and it's it's tough
 And so like how do you get people past that initial pain?
 It's the point where you like you actually have success and you like it and then you desire it
 I think back about my wrestling and I think I've my told the story before but when I was wrestling growing up
 I started in eighth grade actually I started when I was really young and I guess I hated it
 So I did it a year when I was like five and then my parents like quit excited and I started getting eighth grade
 And so I did eighth grads like that's kind of fun
 But I didn't really like it
 I was just kind of there because my dad was making me and I was getting beat up a lot
 And I just like oh this kind of sucks and then I started
 learning in the ninth grade started and I still kind of like
 You know I was going to practice my dad from act practice and try to train me so when you beat up as bad
 And I wasn't good, but like I was kind of like figuring out a little bit
 And I still remember I had my first wrestle off and I wrestled this kid who'd been wrestling for two or three years
 And I beat him which meant I was gonna be JV and I was so scared because
 Like that meant I was gonna be in a match is gonna be in the middle of the gym and everything so that week
 The tournament or the wrestling match happened
 I still remember wrestling bright in high school and I go to Wayans and in Wayans like going to step on the scale
 And then the guy sits on the scale after me and he's this guy and he has a mustache now to this day
 I still can't grow a mustache and he's on there in a mustache and I'm like what in the world and
 I remember going out and going up to the gym and had the wrestling mats out and getting warmed up and
 all of you who stands my mom and dad like three other parents that was in and
 You know everyone's going out the first matches go out in the second
 I'm getting so nervous and find this my turn I go out there and I'm in my singlet
 You know super nervous and awkward and there's this guy crossing me who's got a mustache and I was like this guy like
 You know this this is the real this is like a big dude
 and so I'm shaking his hand we started wrestling and
 At the end of the match I won
 I remember getting my hand raised and looking up into the audience and seeing my mom and dad
 I see my dad jumping around and I was like
 Like from that moment forward. I was a wrestler
 That's when I got the desire I needed and when I had that desire becomes easy right when you have desire like you do anything
 Like I wouldn't eat for you know four or five days out of the week to cut weight to make weight because like I loved it so much
 Like when desire happens it becomes easy, right?
 And so a lot of you guys it's the same thing
 in business like business is like you haven't like you kind of want to do it and
 You know there's kind of that there's kind of that phase in there where it's like how do I do it?
 Do I not do it and like
 And a lot of people get stuck in that before they ever get the desire when you get the desire it all becomes easy because now you're
 Obsessed with it you're gonna read you're gonna study you're gonna do it whether you're successful
 You don't even care you're just gonna go go go because you got that desire
 And so for me
 It's like as a coach of you guys and also as a coach of my team and now my kids
 It's like how do you create that initial desire fast like you have to get past the initial pain and learning curves
 You get to desire as quick as you can and so that's my question for you for yourself
 And for your teams and for everyone just like how do I get past the pain and get to desire because the desire hits
 Then it's fun. I was hoping by I don't have kids with desire than kids
 With talent because talent doesn't mean you're gonna be successful desire does
 In fact, I never thought I was a very good athlete growing up, but I had insane desire
 I loved it. It's in the business. I don't think I was the most charismatic. I was nervous. I talked too fast still kind of
 Do a little bit
 But I desire I loved it. I became obsessed with it
 And so that's the key getting past the pain to have desire
 So for yourself initially look at yourself like you in this pain point if so it's like how do I create desire?
 How do I make it so I'm obsessed with this thing like where it's fun and I love it
 I can't stop thinking about it like that's what you got to get to because then this becomes easy
 It's not work anymore. It's just fun
 You know if I kids I'm a thing with like how do I get them to have desire and from wrestling?
 It's like that's the best way to get desires to get a win
 It's right now like especially my kids first started they wanted to quit every single day
 They'd come up to me literally on the water breaks like hey dad
 Can we quit now and I'm like dude we're in the middle practice like welcome we get now and I'm like no you cannot quit
 And it wasn't like and then they go to matches and they just get beat on and it was just like oh
 And it's like I have to get them good enough
 They can win because when you win then you'll get desire and so I think for you guys
 It's a lot of just like how do I create that initial win?
 In your business in your life whatever it might be
 Couldn't get that first win you taste it and I got my hand raised and I'm looking at this guy with a mustache
 And I beat him boom. That's when I had the desire. That's when I became a wrestler
 That's when you know for you that's when you became an entrepreneur
 That's when you became whatever it is for you and so how do you get those quick wins fast?
 You can create desire how do you get past that initial pain?
 You know a lot of entrepreneurs to come to initially coming like I have this idea for this project wrestling
 Give me these projects that are insanely big and like that sounds amazing if you had ten million dollars in funding that
 You should run after that, but you don't so let's pick a smaller thing
 Let's get a win like let's like let's practice like my first win was a little product called zip-brander
 Right and then how to make potato gun and then form fortunes these little stupid things
 They were little wins but that little win then creates the desire and then that that desires what drives you to the big
 wins so think about that for yourself. How do you create those little wins?
 How do you get past the initial pain so they can have a win and get desire?
 When you're training new people on your team, how do you give them the initial wins they can have desire?
 So putting it out there's a thought I don't know the answer
 It's different every situation, but just know that's your goals people pass the initial pain of a new thing
 And so they can create desire and then from there they'll just go on their own and it'll run and it'll be easy
