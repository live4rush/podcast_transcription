 Hey everybody, it's Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the Marketing Secrets podcast. All right, I got a short one for you today
 but it's one that I think you're gonna love so Marley Jax had me speak at her live event and
 For my presentation she did a QA which was really fun and she has a lot of really really cool questions
 But the very last question she asked me I thought was was was really cool and the way I answered it was different
 Then I think I would have in a normal situation for whatever reason it came up and it's only
 But three and a half minutes long but the question she asked me is like if you were to create one last piece of content one thing that
 You're your friend your family your followers your your legacy that you could tell them if you tell them anything
 What would be the last piece of content you would create and I gave her this response
 So I'm a cute theme song we come back you have a chance to hear my thoughts on what the last piece of content
 I would create would be if I was about to leave this earth
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Your one last piece of content what would you want to share with people?
 That's really cool question. I
 think
 I wish I would I wish I would have understood this when I started my journey because I didn't at all in fact
 I wasn't held by a two or three years ago that I started
 realizing it but
 Just how
 How tied like our our businesses are to like an actual mission from God. I always thought those were separate
 I'm like there's like God and faith and bleed whatever and then there's like
 Our careers and it's like those are in my mind is always these separate things and it wasn't until two or three years in the clickfunnels
 I had an amazing coach who sat me down and she's like do you not understand like how these things are related and like no
 they're separate like they God doesn't care about how much money I make God doesn't care about my business whatever and
 She she's amazing coach. She sat me down and said like I want you to understand like look at this thing like these these things
 You're creating that you're doing that you're making these aren't the like as cool as we all think you are
 You're not that smart. These are coming your inspiration from God
 It's leading you on a way because you've been called to change people's lives
 You've been called a server group of people and you're coming out
 You're serving them and then when they bump into you and you translate you give them the shift and their life changes
 This person's life changes like you're like this is literally calling from God who's who's taking you to help shift other people's lives
 and I was like I
 Never crossed my mind and I remember she's like why in the world do you think 20 years ago?
 You got excited about business like we've said about any kind of learning like no I hated reading it
 Why do you have the biggest library? I know I'm like because for some reason like this thing excited me and I could became this
 Insatiable desire I couldn't stop you know
 I was going to events speaking in front of no people because I loved it so much and like all these things and and she helped me
 Understand like how how tight those things are together. I know some people don't believe in God
 And that's okay
 You can believe in whatever you want but but conceptually like those things are tied together
 And I think if I could sit down myself 20 years ago or sit down to any entrepreneur and help them sit down and say look
 This is the deal you think you're starting a business right now
 But it's not that you've been called to serve a group of entrepreneurs or group of people or group like there
 We all have stewardship over somebody like we've been called and while most people they get the calling and they freak out
 And they walk away and don't do anything with it, which is like devastating
 But for those who are doing it like you they have this calling and it's scary and you will never feel worthy
 You're like I'm not ready. I'm not worthy. I got the posture center like right like who am I to help these people?
 Like I'm I'm struggling as much as they are worse than some situations like how like like all those things right?
 You don't feel worthy
 But all you know is that and I've been called and I got to figure this out because if I don't do that
 Like that stewardship will be taken away from me to be given somebody else and hopefully that person who but I like this is my calling
 I need to figure this out and you look at that lens
 It's like oh my gosh like I have stewardship of these people
 I need to serve them
 I got to figure it out and that's when you start looking at all the stuff differently right like the content you're creating
 It's like as scary as for you how awkward you feel it's like doesn't matter like this is your calling like you were called to serve
 Some people so get that thing out there put it out there and your people are gonna hear you in the new test
 My Christ talks about this. He says he says my sheep will hear my voice and they will come to me right
 It's the same thing for all of us like that's a that's a that's a that's a that's a true principle
 I don't care what faith you or what belief like that is a true principle like your sheep will hear your voice
 Yeah, it's your job
 It's not to convert the world of your way of thinking or anything your job is to get your message out there
 And if you do it consistently your sheep will hear your voice they'll come to you and you'll have a chance to change your life
 I think if I could tell every entrepreneur like they like you were literally changing the lives of people you've been called to serve
 And this is not just your career versus whatever but those things are interrelated
 That's what I tell them all because then you would care more you'd work harder
 You'd be more passionate because you realize that this is more than just me trying to make money
 This is me changing people's lives. So it'd be that hmm. That's a great way to end that Mike drop
