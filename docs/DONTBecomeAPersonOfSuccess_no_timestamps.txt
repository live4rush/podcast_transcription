 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson and the marketing seekers podcast. I've got another really cool thing to share from you from our recent affiliate mastermind
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet
 Still remain profitable
 That was the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right everybody so this is one that thought was really powerful
 This was also a really cool strategy shared by JLD John Lee Dumas
 EO on fire and he talked about how when he was growing up
 He wanted to be successful. So he was doing things making successfully going to school. He was getting jobs
 he was like trying to become successful and
 Somewhere in this journey. He said that he heard a quote from from Albert Einstein and
 The quote and I'm probably gonna mess this up
 Actually, let's do this. I'm gonna I'm gonna cut the clips you can hear him actually say it and tell the story because he'll say more
 More articulate that I can
 So let's go listen that clip right now and we'll come right back
 And so at 32 years old I kind of had this realization when I read this quote by Albert Einstein, which was
 Try not to become a person of success
 But rather a person of value and I was like oh like I've been trying to become a person of success my whole life
 And it hasn't really worked. So what is this value thing?
 So I started kind of really doing some research on like what it meant to be a person of value and
 That's when I started looking around my world and saying like what?
 like are people or what people are adding value in some my life and those people really in
 2012 were podcasters and I was like man these people are adding free value to my life and they're amazing
 Maybe this is something I can I can kind of look at and so that's kind of what led me down the path of launching my own
 Podcast so that I could then create free valuable and consistent content like that's my three special ingredients for success
 Like because I deliver free valuable and consistent content. I was able to grow an audience
 so I thought that was such a key because I know that for most of us like
 Like for me, I want to be successful and it's like
 If we're running towards success a lot of times we don't realize that that's not what makes you successful
 It's figuring out how to provide value how to be a person of value like that is the key
 And when you do that then you'll get the success that you want there's so many things in life that we have that problem where it's like
 There's a direct path to success
 But instead of just going and getting it we go and we do things on these huge loops to try to get the success we want
 You know what funny ones when I first started working with Tony Robbins started learning all his six human needs and things like that
 It was interesting because prior that my wife and I had a conversation and I remember I was out there
 You know trying to build this business trying to like do all these cool things and trying to impress her
 So that we would have more love and connection between me and her and I was going this huge route
 Try to get a little more love and connection
 I remember one day I came home and I was like all excited about stuff and my wife you tell that she missed me and she was like
 I just wish you'd come home and I was like
 What I was like, but I'm doing all these things, you know for for us as sometimes we say and as I thought more about it
 I was like I'm doing these things for myself
 I'm trying to feel a little bit more significant more all these kind of things so that I can impress her so that we can have love and
 Connections from one of the huge route to love and connection where I could just came home and get it gotten the same level connection
 And it's just interesting how sometimes as humans we go in this route
 I think that this is one of the things I really got out of the foot of the mastermind
 It's just like if you want to be a person's success like don't pursue success pursue being a person of value and the person who provides
 The most value to the audience of the people who become successful and you understand that game changes
