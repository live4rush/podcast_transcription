 What's up everybody? Good morning. This is Russell Brunson and when I officially welcome you back to the marketing seekers podcast
 I feel like this is like old-school marketing your car though because I'm literally my car
 I know what I'm trying to do most of the episodes in studio and making videos and vlogs and stuff out of them
 But I just miss hanging out when I have something I want to talk about so here we go
 I'm driving for the next 15 minutes, so we're gonna go deep on some fun stuff. I hope you're okay with that
 I'm gonna talk about the change of this shift from momentum to actual domination
 You're listening to marketing secrets with your host Russell Brunson
 All right, everybody so I'm having a good time hanging out with you guys in the car again while I'm driving
 Don't worry I'm being safe. There's no way I get in trouble plus I'm driving a Tesla so it's driving itself doesn't even need me
 I'm basically useless in the equation so
 Nobody's sending in questions or comments for you nervous, but do please by the way sending your questions or comments
 If you go to marketing seekers calm right now
 There's this spot where you can actually go submit questions that will come to me
 I'll be adding more sessions where I'm answering cute ace from you guys
 So please go and drop a question in there and let me know and maybe we'll show up on an episode which is kind of fun
 so
 Okay, but I want to talk about this today. So my last few episodes I talked about
 fun hacking live what we did and you know all the all the chaos and the fun and the craziness that happened there and and
 It's craziest for hacking live is
 the next like the next like month of my life was
 Even crazier and I want to talk about that and hopefully pull a couple things you guys can I don't get some ideas or learn something from
 This is my hope so
 It's interesting last year when we started in January
 It's when I officially taken over Dan Kennedy's company
 I was writing the newsletter and and I talked in January
 I was like and I'm not the kind of person that you know every year picks a word
 I think a lot of people do and for some reason I was like in that newsletter I talked in the January
 I'm like I feel like this year's like the year momentum like on the click funnel side
 You know we had spent it's been over two years now when we started ClickFunnels 2.0
 We decided to make this shift in this pivot
 And when we did it
 Todd and I and Dave when we made the decision like hey, we're not gonna sell ClickFunnels. We're going to
 Instead build 2.0 and we're gonna do all that goes into that which means we need to sacrifice a lot
 Which means we weren't gonna take distributions and and I got all these things for a period of time
 We didn't know how long that period of time was gonna be we thought it was gonna be year turned out it was too
 That's the story for the other day
 But like when we were we're
 You know we decided to make that that thing we knew there was gonna be the time of like just this building where it's gonna be
 We're gonna feel stuck right as entrepreneurs were momentum-based creatures as Alex Sharpen would say and
 You know we knew that we were gonna be building but we were gonna lack momentum in so many areas
 And it's gonna be hard and frustrating
 And so in January of last year
 I was like, okay
 This is the year 2.0 is coming out and like the word for me this year is momentum
 And it was crazy because then I heard Todd on a call with our team
 He's like my word for this year is momentum and I was like dude
 I literally said the same thing in the newsletter article this month and we had he hadn't seen it yet
 It was just kind of an interesting thing where we both felt the same thing
 This is our year momentum and I think honestly if I'm completely honest
 ClickFunnels 2.0 was gonna launch in January or February or varge or April made due to July August or September
 And it took us all the way till September to launch it and so it was still like half more than half of the year
 Just like oh like trying to get the scene out the door and trying to give birth and you know
 The birthing process is so much fun and so painful and so rewarding when it happens, you know and finally
 Have fun hiking lives when we had a chance to launch
 ClickFunnels 2.0 to the world and then but it was just to the people at Funnel Hacking Live
 Right and it's crazy because like we had been using it and testing it and but one person testing a platform versus a thousand versus ten thousand versus a hundred thousand is different
 And so we did the best we could and then it's like went to Funnel Hacking Live and we launched it and then people started using it
 And then we started seeing okay, here's a little hiccups here and there there, you know
 And we started scrambling and then from there it was
 it was
 Making shifts and changes and then we did the 2.0 launch and all these other things and and then it was out into the world into momentum
 And it's like so good, but I wanted to kind of
 I wanted to share with you is what that looked like because
 I don't know there's the there's the season where
 You're you're trying to get something into momentum and it is not easy giving birth to a new thing is not easy
 And it's crazy because it was like two weeks before fun hacking lives when I made the decision
 To shift our entire coaching program as well like there's a lot of things happening once
 You guys have heard me talk a little bit about the linchpin I talked about a lot at Funhacking Live
 but I knew that they as a company as
 We're doing internally with all of our companies what I wanted to do with our coaching everything
 It was gonna seem to this new model of the linchpin and so two weeks before funhacking live
 We decided to make that shift which meant I had to go spend the two weeks before funhacking
 I have preparing for funhacking live plus recording and training all the content for
 This new coaching program, but we're inside two common clovex. We're teaching the linchpin
 We're showing the linchpin and stuff like that and so I was trying to do all that stuff and funhacking
 I've happened and we got home from funhacking live and you know
 a normal human being would take a week or two off and relax and celebrate the wins, but
 It was the beginning of us trying to get into momentum, right? And so literally week after funhacking live
 Sunday we flew home and Monday I got back in the office and started preparing for an event that's happened next Monday
 At click from the HQ which was the linchpin event and so I spent that whole week preparing for the linchpin event
 As well as funhacking I have replays which would happen the same week, right?
 And then you know a week later after funhacking live we had a whole bunch of entrepreneurs in our office
 Inner Circle members I did a two-day full event teaching
 The linchpin where I was the only speaker for two days speaking and teaching this whole new model, right?
 It was amazing then the next day on Wednesday
 We had a whole one-day event and luckily I didn't teach that one
 But we helped kind of facilitate it was an understanding on me event because we're trying to launch that company as well
 And we needed to create the quick start as this taught inside of the linchpin and so we did a whole one-day event there
 And then we know we had three or four days off the weekend
 And then the next week is when we started the click funnels 2.0 launch
 Which was your first funnel challenge, right?
 And some of you saw that we did a whole week of promotions and everything getting people into the challenge and getting affiliates there
 And promote it we end up getting man over 200,000 people
 who
 Registered for the year first funnel challenge and after we had that then we did the five-day challenge which was
 You know every day going live and then having guest speakers and all the chaos that goes that in the VIP room
 So it was you be live every single day for five days and what no one knew is as soon as the lives got done
 Then we had some of the most amazing
 Funnel experts in the office that we're filming afterwards
 We had Jeff Walker and Trey Llewell and all these amazing speakers who were also there that week so we're filming
 This stuff will be coming out this month that week as well. So it was five full days Monday Tuesday
 There's a Friday of doing this challenge
 to launch 2.0 to get it out in the world and so it was like
 planning in the morning creating one-pagers and then jumping on stage teaching for an hour and then having guest speaker guest speaker then
 coming back in and then doing a VIP for an hour and then it breaks and then
 quickly getting everybody on
 You know filming the next sessions and then I had to head out to wrestling practice because wrestling practice for middle school starts
 I was racing out to wrestling practice and they get home for wrestling practice and
 Sometimes they'd still be filming the office would run back to the office to make sure the filming was happening well and then
 And then from there
 It's like I had to create the one-pagers and the training for the next day and it was just like it was insane
 Those five days and you think when the five days was over it should be over
 But it wasn't because then on Saturday we did a bonus day which was like a literally like a mini funnel hacking live
 All the on Saturday
 Which was tons of guest speakers plus in the middle that we had an affiliate mastermind where we had
 50 affiliates you came to Boise and spent two days here in the office during the challenge week during the launch week
 Like is the live studio audience, but then as soon as the event was over then we were doing masterminds all night
 I'm like oh, do you guys can see behind the scenes?
 It was nuts, but it was all the things required to create enough momentum to get
 Clickfunnels 2.0 out into the world
 And I don't have all the stats here in front of you, but after we got that launched into the world
 Making me the fight a challenge with the six-day bonus day on a Monday with an affiliate day, which was amazing
 We had two of our top affiliates come in and teach as well
 And then after all that stuff then it was like we had put this thing into the atmosphere, right?
 We'd got into orbit and you think about like a rocket right like a rocket is sitting there
 It has to get out of the atmosphere into orbit and there's so much that goes into it
 Right like all the boosters and the jets and the stuff to like push this thing in into momentum
 And I think it's out of the you know beyond gravity is out into the solar
 So then it can float and it can hang out there and it can change it can grow but like my role is the
 You know as the entrepreneur in the business is to do the
 like the insane amount of effort and pressure that a rocket does to get a spaceship into the into the thing, right?
 And it was it was it was crazy
 Like I'm still tired from that. I'm not gonna lie
 It's so we got that out into the ecosystem and out into the world and now it's an orbit
 Which is so nice and now it's like my team is working on you know the programming and and
 onboarding and you know the tech side and the support side and that all you know the the module like the training and like
 There's a million things happening now that they don't really don't involve me
 But getting into orbit was like very very heavily
 dependent on like on that and so I think that's for a lot of us is understanding like using entrepreneurs like you have to get things to orbit
 Which is like for a finite period of time to get things in momentum. You have to go
 Deep like really really deep. I wish that you could say oh, it's all about balance and oh it's all about like
 You know and like and yeah after it's in orbit you can bring people and systems and teams in and they can it can be balanced
 But that initial inertia needed to get into momentum
 At least for me, maybe I'm doing it all wrong, but it is extreme amounts of
 Work and effort and pressure to get something into the atmosphere and so that's what it was for us
 It was
 Honestly a couple weeks before fun hiking live was fun hiking live
 Post fun hiking live was all the lynchkin stuff for the event and then it was boom 2.0 launch and the launch is over
 I had a couple day break and then we had inner circle meetings we had
 Two days the my category Kings which was insane and then two days with the whole inner circle group and then after mind
 It was crazy and then after the whole I'm the oh
 Yeah, we did I think it was eight or nine events. It was nine events. We did in five weeks
 So just to put in perspective how chaotic was right? We did the inner circle events and then the night the inner circle ended
 Justin Benton set up a meeting with the Napoleon Hill Foundation and so I
 Got down there circle and we jumped in a plane
 Little that same night inner circle ended and flew to
 Why is Virginia to go meet Don Green the point Hill Foundation and see the archives and spend time with them and negotiate a big business
 They were trying to work on with them and which was crazy and from there we flew back home just in time for Halloween
 We went to treating my kids and then wrestling season was like full full swing and then
 That whole you know all the chaos happens there and then last weekend finally finally finally
 My wife and I stuck away and flew to California spent like three days in a hotel by ourselves just like literally sleeping in
 I slept in three days in a row without an alarm clock it was amazing
 And they came back and now I'm back kind of in the heat of it
 but it was crazy to get things in momentum and
 After that was all done. I did a big call with my team and
 And honestly it's because like and the the the effort again
 It takes to get something into inertia like it's brutal
 I mean it's brutal on me, but it's not just me it's brutal on our events team our support team our development team are
 Like all the teams right advertising team like there's so many teams that made this all happen in like and so we literally did a call
 Did our entire team and I just like I just literally wanted to just say thank you to everyone like I'm sure like I feel like this
 I'm sure every else feels everyone else feels beat up and tired and worn out and like
 and
 And I wanted to thank them all and let know like you know
 We spent the last two years building this amazing thing in the last you know six weeks was us killing ourselves
 To get this thing into momentum like the momentum we talked about in January like momentum. That's the word of the year
 To get into momentum it was it was excruciating effort to get this thing into outer space into momentum
 I'm like now we're in momentum now. We have like the world that our fingertips sounds like now we're momentum like
 You know the the problem is the most people get into momentum and then they want to drift and they drift back to
 To the state they started that right?
 I was like I don't want to drift back in the state like right now like the world's like the what's the the saying like the world is our
 Oyster like it's just there for the taking like we need to go and and do it
 I said you know right now we have this unique opportunity like
 Clickfunnels 2.0 is the buzz like we're doing like then there's noise in the marketplace people are talking and like
 We can either like rest and slow down or it's like we can transition out from momentum to actual domination
 I was like that's my plan is
 The shift for momentum to domination that's like I'm I'm sure you guys this is this is how many this is the plan
 This is what I'm gonna do and why I'm gonna do it and I'm kind of laid out the plan for the team and so
 Anyway, so my you know my word for next year. There's a word. It's domination like
 Now that we're in momentum now. It's like I want to capitalize on it
 But I want to do it in a way that that I can't do
 Moment like the energy
 Expenditure to get something into momentum. I can't keep doing long term. I won't be able to handle it and I can handle a lot
 But I don't think my team can handle it. I can't handle it like
 So it's like now how do we strategically
 use this momentum and
 Leveraging the way we're working turn it into domination and that's the next question, which I'm excited for
 So anyway, my plan and my thought is
 Yeah, I'm gonna end this episode right now on a cliffhanger
 Because this is all about momentum to domination and then I'm gonna talk about some of my vision for actual domination in the next episode
 Which hopefully you guys will enjoy so
 Yeah, so there you go you guys. I think
 The thing that I hope that you would get from this if I have like what are the intentions? I want somebody to get from this is
 understanding the like
 To put something amazing out in the world. It's not just balanced life. It's not
 You know what most people are trying to figure out like it's it takes a
 Period of extreme unbalanced to get the rocket ship into orbit, right?
 Takes like all that effort you give you look at the rock ships. That's a perfect example like
 They can NASA whoever in there they've got this ship and they've got to get it into orbit like it's
 Huge boosters and rockets always need just to get it out of the atmosphere into the spot where it can be in orbit
 And that's your job. That's your roles the entrepreneur, right?
 you have team that can build systems that can they can
 Keep it in orbit and keep it getting it better and improving a part of it for you to like
 Have something that people can improve upon like you got to get into orbit and it's understanding that like you don't say
 I'm in momentum like yeah, that like momentum it takes takes
 The initial inertia to get it into momentum
 So the question is for you is like where you at in your process like are you are you?
 Do you have momentum yet? Do you do you not?
 If if not say okay, like you had a buckled out so Cameron spend
 Six weeks planning to get the scene of momentum. How many do you have to do it through a challenge?
 I'm gonna do through this a webinar I'm gonna do it through JV's I'm gonna do it through whatever your thing is right
 I'm gonna live event I figure out that thing and then go get it into momentum and then
 After some momentum make sure it's not just a one-off thing. We did all the work and it dies
 Right, that's the problem with the product launch models. We launch product and then it dies like now you do all the work
 And now you're momentum like now how do we keep it momentum? I keep it running keep it running
 And that's the hope you get from this episode right is the the inertia takes something to get in the momentum
 And then and then now it's there now it's like okay step back take your breath
 and then
 Getting the systems the teams in place to keep it momentum and next episode I'm gonna talk about the transition now for momentum to actual
 Domination how do you do it? It was crazy is like my big ahaan how to do it something
 I learned in the middle of the five-day challenge it was
 Excuse me was actually on day five
 During my hour long interview with Damon John. He said one little thing
 I think most people missed it in fact. I missed it during the live interview
 I interviewed him live
 In studio and he said it and I didn't catch it and then during day five when I was watching it
 He said it again. I was like oh I missed it
 That was it that was the nugget and so I'm gonna share with that because I'll show that with you as next because that's the
 the transition from momentum to actual domination
 and
 Not only learned it during day five of Damon, but then I saw in actual practical application when I flew it to wise Virginia
 To me at the Pauline Hill Foundation. So
 Between those two experiences where I kind of figured out this is the path. This is the process
 This is the way I'll show that with you as my next episode. I hope you enjoyed this one
 I miss hanging out here in the car. So hopefully we'll rotate between probably some of these audio ones and video ones just
 Keep it fun. So appreciate you guys. Thank you for listening and we'll talk to y'all again soon. Bye everybody
