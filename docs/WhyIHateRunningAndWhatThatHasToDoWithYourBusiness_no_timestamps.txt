 Hey everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast. I am so excited to have you here today
 Today, I'm gonna be talking about why I hate running what that may have to do with you if you're struggling in your business
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, so I hope you're first off you all doing amazing today
 I'm at the office and preparing for a flight tomorrow. I'm actually heading out to Atlanta to speak at a big event with Tony Robbins
 Which is kind of cool. I was gonna officially to retire from speaking this year
 But then Tony's like hey, do you want to speak in front of 6,000 people and I'm like, you know what the answer is always
 Yes, so I'm going there. It's gonna be really fun
 And you're holding the presentation which means I have been killing myself for the last day and a half trying to create a whole new presentation
 Because I only have 60 minutes and I'm selling a $500
 Of one fun away challenge kit
 Which is something different I've ever sold before I used to sell $3,000 from stage
 So it's I've less time lower to your price
 But I'm doing it because I'm testing my material if you're listening along for a while I'm testing this presentation because
 The speaker team we've been building we're really struggling getting people to allow them to speak for 90 minutes and sell
 $3,000 product and most of them are like we want an hour-long presentation of why you sell $500 product so
 this
 Speaking this event besides speaking at a Tony event with 6,000 people which is exciting anyway
 It's forcing me to create this presentation that then the speaker team can use as long as the presentation goes well
 So it's gonna be fun. I'm excited to see how it all goes and hopefully works
 So wish me luck, but I digress today. I want to talk to you about something else actually
 Basically what I want to talk to you is about is
 Last week we had our family reunion up at Bear Lake
 As they barely got a hope it's on the Utah Idaho border, so it's actually a Bear Lake Utah
 It was my my family and we had a great time
 But what's interesting is that my wife and I are like this
 notification we're gonna be healthy we're gonna like do all these things and so it's funny because you know each night a different family member has
 the dinner and then everyone makes a dessert and
 After like every year I go and I gain like 15 pounds I come home
 And it's like a month and a half to get to lose all the way and I gained on the
 family union you know
 So this year I'm like I'm gonna be healthy. So day one we're super healthy like they had pizza
 I was like I'm not eating pizza. I'm just gonna eat salad, which was you know sad because the pizza looks so good
 But I just had salad didn't have dessert and then day two
 The next morning we woke up and Clint and I went running which was awesome
 I'm talking about in a minute
 So we're running and then next morning I was sore and then they had dessert and it was so good and they had dinner and dessert
 And then by the end of the week I didn't make it to our goal at all
 But you had a good time so
 But I tell you that because the first day we went running and we were gonna run every day
 But we only end up running one day. So yeah, you know we try
 Sometimes we just can't do it, but we were running and so we went running and
 We're in this trailer parks kind of funny hills we ran down the hill to the trailer park we ran
 Across like the valley
 Beautiful green valley and then we ran up to this golf course and turned around and we ran back
 And I think the whole whole route was like three miles or so long and so we're doing it having fun and
 It was initially after we got the golf course we're running back
 We're in down this hill overlooks this huge valley you can see the lake and it's beautiful and as we're running down
 My wife's talking about they're like oh look at the lake look at the thing and I remember being annoyed for a second because I was
 Looking at my feet
 I was running and I'm like oh like if I
 So like annoyed, you know, I was kind of annoyed I looked up and then when I did look up I was like oh
 My gosh, this is beautiful out here like
 Look at this whole thing and I start looking like out of my feet
 And I kept looking my feet and then I stopped my stop looking my feet look up again and look around I'm like
 Oh my gosh, this is beautiful and then I had this epiphany and I told Klet that I said you know I realized
 Whenever I run I'm always looking at my feet
 My whole life and I don't know why I think it's because in wrestling when we run typically under like long
 sprints it's like or not long like marathon style running wrestling is more like a lot of like ladders
 Right
 We're running to like the 10-yard line then back and then 20-yard line back and so you're so you're watching your feet because you're you're going in
 Out in out, you know and so I watched my feet I run and I was like I told Kletz said I realized why I hate running
 I think I said, you know
 We're doing this huge runs beautiful spot and the whole time I'm looking at my feet and I see my feet and I'm missing
 Everything else I said after I start looking up
 I said I see why people like running out because you have this beautiful view and you're seeing the scenery
 You're seeing all this stuff
 but I've always missed it because I'm always looking at my feet and
 After I said that I tried to make a conscious effort to look up while I was running the whole time
 And it was really hard to me because I kept forcing myself or my you know my my pattern whatever my my body kept looking down
 My feet looking at my feet cause that's what was so used to from from you know almost 40 years now we're running
 Was looking at my feet when I ran and so I look up and then I'm like I enjoy it and then I'd slip back
 I'm patting looking down on my feet again like ah look up look up and I enjoy it and
 As I was thinking about that when I'm running I was like oh my gosh
 This is a metaphor for so many things like so many things in life that we struggle with
 It's because we're not looking up and looking at the scenery right? I think a lot of people get into business and
 They're looking at their feet right?
 They're looking at like the stress of like I don't the money on this
 I don't have to end like all the things that happen when you're trying to start a business and try to launch your company and trying to grow it and
 Looking at their feet and because that they hate it. They're miserable. They're not happy and they're not enjoying it
 Right. I think about like why do I love this game so much like I love marketing. I love business
 I love all the stuff that we talk about I think you know
 Metaphorically in in the business like I'm always looking up and looking around as I'm moving forward
 I'm like enjoying this process and the journey and the people I'm eating and like and
 Like I'm enjoying it. That's why I love why I love business so much worse
 I think so many people are looking at their feet when they're in business, right?
 And they're looking at the the stuff that's stressing about what they don't have yet
 What they wish they have like all these things as opposed to looking up and looking around so
 I want to show it metaphor to you
 So I think hopefully it'll be helpful for some of you guys if you're not enjoying this business journey means you're probably looking at your feet
 And so I'd recommend do it I'd had to do to enjoy my run the other day is stop looking at your feet
 The day-to-day that the things that are that are moving forward because those things there's you know
 They're not necessarily a lot of fun
 But when you look up you look around you start seeing the people and the vision and the business and the and the lives you're changing
 And like those kind of things that's what gives you the fuel and the excitement to wake up every single morning to keep going forward and keep having fun
 And keep trying to change people's lives. So and I hope that helps somebody out there
 I thought it was really interesting as I was running and I was like man, I bet you my whole life
 I could have actually enjoyed running had I had looked up and so I'm gonna start doing that more often
 So I'm trying to have a goal this year that by Christmas the end this year is to to be in the single digits body fat percentage to be
 like
 9% or 9.9 or whatever just under 10% body fat which I haven't been in like
 7 or 8 years so that's one of my goals is try to try to hit that this year
 Which means I've got to go put in some road work where I'm gonna do it
 So to do that my whole goal is to start looking up and join this journey because if I do then I'll stick with it
 Otherwise, I'm just gonna see my feet. It's gonna be ugly. I'm gonna be bored. So
 Probably you can use that advice and more than just your business and your running as well. It's probably applicable to a lot of things
 So all right, I'm gonna leave you there with that. Hope that you've got some value with that and
 Start looking up when you're running appreciate you all and we'll talk to you all soon. Bye everybody
