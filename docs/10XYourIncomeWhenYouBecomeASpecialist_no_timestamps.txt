 Hey, what's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing secrets podcast looks that heavy is here tonight
 I've got some really fun. We're sure of you
 So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own
 pockets
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so
 I'm going to show the best way to kind of pre-set this up
 But I want to share this with you because I think this is why a lot of people struggle in fact looking backwards now
 It's always easier to look hindsight, right? But looking backwards
 I think this is one reason why I struggled for for so long probably almost almost a decade
 and
 the reason why is because
 I was trying I was trying to do the right things right I was trying to figure out how to provide value for my my customers and
 And so I was learning all sorts of things right and so as I was learning everything
 I was like trying to teach these things trying to share things which is good. I think a lot of times
 people like us who are
 creators and who like to give and serve like this is kind of our nature to do that right and
 So I don't think it was bad
 necessarily, but what happens I started becoming like a
 Jack of all trades and a master of none right
 I remember that when I first started getting to the internet marketing business and teaching stuff
 I looked around the marketplace at the time and there were people that all like were specifically good at one thing right like Jeff Walker
 was good at product launches and frame curves good at mass control and they had all these people and I can't
 all the names right now, but you know Perry Perry Marshall was
 PVC and Brad Fallon was SEO and everyone's like good at a one thing right but for me like I started learning all these things
 Or John Carlton was copywriting and all the people had one thing and I was like for me
 I was like I was good at all those things right I knew I do SEO and I knew to pay a quick and how to do
 Copywriting and I knew I do product launches and I knew I do all these weird things and so like I would try to
 To sell myself like I could teach I can do everything for you guys and I would try to show them everything
 And what's interesting is that I've tried to show people how to do everything
 It was hard to really grow and scale my my empire or whatever you want to call it right
 And it's always weird to be somebody oh you go there and get one thing that person you can get like everything for me
 they come to me and
 And I think it's because I loved it all and I get down and I wanted to share it all
 But because like no one could ever look at Russell and be like Russell's the guy who does this they're like Russell is
 You know he's this guy who's teaching all sorts of stuff and like because I had specialized nobody ever wanted to come to me
 It was really this it was interesting
 And it was always frustrating to me because I was just like oh I felt like I was as good or not better than most of these people
 But because I didn't specialize it was harder to get to people in right and so
 That was me for a decade though, but I struggled because I like I knew I was good all these different things so because of that
 I wanted to do them all
 now fast forward to
 you know four or five years ago whenever
 we started making this transition and
 you know as we launched click funnels I kind of became the funnel person right and
 And it wasn't like strategic is just because because I was click funnels
 It's like oh he's the guy who's funnels and I start talking about more I start sharing it more like I became obsessed with just that one piece
 And so because that I start just going deep into two funnels
 I think that if you ask anybody now like they look at me as like oh Russell's the funnel guy right like
 And I was the first fun guy wasn't you know
 And honestly I'd be teaching funnels for a decade prior to that right
 But for some reason like it wasn't like my it was just like one of the things my tool belt
 But it wasn't the thing when it became the thing is changed everything my business
 also like people who wanted to learn funnels came to me like and and I watched this in my
 Empire my brand my whatever one call it started growing dramatically now after I like became the guy this one thing
 I was the guy at funnel building
 What's cool? I bring my audience in but I can still do and still serve them all the other things right like but it all comes
 Under one core thing like funnel building that was my thing like I was the guy about funnels
 And then I can teach traffic the 72 traffic. It was like fill your phone. Here's how we fill your funnel full people
 I could still teach copywriting but wasn't just like copy it was funnel scripts like here's how we do the copy for your funnels
 I can still teach
 Traffic generator. I mean all these are pieces right that I was good at I still teach them all but they're all in the context of
 This one thing funnel building and when I did that like boom
 You know you see how things grew and I was able to build you know
 We were able to build software around in my trainings and everything else master minds and coaching programs all around this one thing
 Which was the funnel now once again?
 I can side of that I can teach all things that have been forward because now it's known for one thing that was the key
 and
 So that was kind of the first thing I want to share with you is but it goes deeper than that so
 Today I had a chance I my wife's out of town at a funeral for her grandma
 And so I was home with the boys and so I did spend a lot of time with them which was fun then I also went
 And worked out for my own kind of just had some time to myself too
 So I was listening to podcasts and I want to podcast
 I was listening a lot to his day in a derks
 His podcast and one of his books and stuff like that
 And it's been interesting because I've known day to now for probably two or three years or something like that
 He'd ramered her circle and he spoke of fahr hockey Maya this year. It was interesting is like when I met Dana
 He he was famous the time for like copywriting for Amazon listings
 He was charged people 10 or 20 grand to write like a listing in Amazon
 And that was like his thing right and it was good
 He's making really good money, but it's like it's one off things and got tired of writing
 So things like I'm gonna write a book teach people how to do what I do throw this book and then he was like instead selling the book for
 You know really really cheap of himself really expensive
 So we started selling these books teach people how to do Amazon copywriting for like 500 to a thousand dollars per book
 And that started doing better gave them leverage sure to make more money
 But still the marketplace, you know that it wasn't like the big market
 I think he really wanted and so then he transitioned from from there to like teach me like hey
 You can write these really sense books like I did so we created a book
 They started selling for like twenty five hundred dollars the top people had to write books and sell them for like a thousand dollars at a time
 And that was a thing it was doing well, but I don't think it was ever huge and then
 I would start selling that book because that there was he
 He got a strategy. I think he he got for me and I got it from Chet Holmes
 And it was this concept of the dream 100
 But she at Holmes
 There's one chapter in his book called the dream 100 and then inside of my luck my training
 I think I've referenced it four or five times and I'm a big believer in the dream 100
 In fact my new book traffic secrets the foundation of that is the dream 100, which is kind of cool, but then
 Dana took it and like put on steroids he wrote a whole book about he started doing it for his own stuff
 And he started for other people and like that became this like this new
 It looked Dana like he has become the dream 100 guy and like he has a whole back-end thing for like
 I don't know 30 or 40 50 thousand dollars
 We actually does dream 100 for you and like all these crazy things
 these guys book on dream 100 and like now like that's become his his thing and
 And you know, he may he may transition in the future
 Who knows but right now like that's becoming his thing
 He's got the book on front
 He's got the done for you
 You're done with you on the back and all these things these went deep deep deep deep into this one little piece, right?
 It's one piece of like a chapter of Chet Holmes book. It was a chapter of
 Well, I share and he's taken it and gone deep and built huge business out of it now
 And it's all just because he is now the dream 100 guy. He's focusing
 Really really tight on that which is just
 Really fascinating to me
 You know again, I took my like here's my scope of everything I possibly do and what I would took one piece of it
 And became the guy and he went deep on that that's everything below for me for Dana
 I think it's the same thing like there was copywriting and there was there was
 Writing and all these different things were became like dream 100 traffic like it's how you get traffic
 This is the best way to get traffic the only way to get traffic is you focus on dream 100 dream 100 100 100 100
 And that's when things blew up nice guys dream 100 con coming out
 Which is a big event he's doing and all these things but he's going deep in that one vein
 And that's where now people are coming to him because he's the guy that does the dream 100 right
 And uh, and I think that's so cool. I saw recently also Stephen Larson's sister. He's worked for us
 um, really large son and she she um
 And I don't know everything kind of hurt hopefully but what she's done really good
 I know she's I believe she's helping Stephen this podcast and getting published or whatever
 She decided I'm going to become the podcast person. So she went down. I was like, I'm going to become the best person at
 at uh at podcasting and so she did that and um, I'm a teach-related podcast and helping podcast me to build a service here on
 I'm new and I get my podcast about podcasts and I all the stuff that started focusing on that one little piece like
 One little sliver of the market because she's now becoming that person like people are coming to her
 And she's helping them do podcasts and she went from you know, not making any money online to overnight
 You know making I have no idea her revenue so I'm guessing
 5,000 10,000 dollars a month or more and just because that became the thing, right?
 Um another good one is uh, yada golden
 um
 who uh
 Super cool person and she was doing relationship coaching other things and having success in different pieces
 But um inside a doc on secrets button
 There's one little chapter about soap opera sequences right and how to write the soap opera sequences
 And so she took that piece and started with herself and started with some friends and started having success and started
 Gicking out on going deeper deeper deeper now. She's like, I'm just gonna be the person who writes these really amazing email sequences
 And then she did for one person and it blew up for them and then someone else someone else and then ever started hearing about it
 And that right now she's making um, I'm getting I don't know her exact numbers are probably not even
 You know, I know it's well. I know it's you know
 More than 25,000 dollars a month. She's making out writing emails for people and going deep into that and she hasn't even created a course or training or anything
 She's just doing the the the service and making more than a doctor mates
 Right because she went super deep on that one little skill at one little piece
 um
 And so for you guys, I think a lot of times we're trying to become so good at everything teach everything and do everything and like
 I kind of think but it's like
 Look at the whole market. Look at all this about there. Just pick the sliver
 That you could become the person that then you can go the deepest and the best in the world at that one little thing
 I figure out that one little piece
 And go go deep like that's that's the magic. It's not in being
 A generalist who's good at everything
 Um, you can do that you should be that because it's good to have your skills there
 But the magic comes when you specialize in like in in the little thing, right?
 Um, I mean look at doctors for example, then
 The more a doctor specializes in a thing the more money they can charge, right?
 um
 I have a lot of people live around me their doctors and the ones who go to more medical school specialize in it
 It's a tiny new thing make more money than the generalist who are able to fix kind of everything
 And so that's the mindset when you guys think into it. It's like in your market where what is the
 Like how do you become the person like the sliver that one little piece that you're gonna
 Oh, it's gonna be your thing that you do better anywhere else you can geek out on so someone's like, what does what does so-and-so do?
 Like, oh, he's the person or she's the person that does podcasting that does email sequences that does
 um, you know weight loss for
 Teenagers, I mean, whatever is in your market. Like what's that thing find that thing and don't be don't be nervous like, oh, it's such a small segment
 Like the smaller it is the more specific the more specialized you become the more valuable you are when I became
 I was Russell Brunson the guy who knew all every type of marketing or demand
 I was I was a generalist and I was not I didn't get paid
 But I feel like I was working when I specialized and became the funnel guy
 That's when my income exploded, right?
 And then and after you understand that then it's like when you you can layer on other things within the context of that
 But you do it all from that same foundation, right?
 Like I said with funnel building with me like that's my thing
 But I can lay on copywriting land trafficking land these other pieces still but they're all kind like you'll notice I
 I pretty much have fun away in the word of everyone my products now like funnel or secret like those two words of mine
 Right there and everything because those are the things that tie back to the one thing and the best in the world that and so
 Anyway for you think about that. What is the thing you can become the best in the world at and the smaller
 I mean you think about dream 100 that's such a small thing like for me
 It was like a page and a half and one of our books like that's as much effort
 I put in that like I wouldn't have thought you could build a huge business
 But because someone took that piece that sliver went super super deep
 Boom Danny's building a multi million dollar your business out of it, right?
 Because yada took his soap opera sequences that one little piece that you know five or six pages that she learned and they went deep with it
 Boom 25,000 plus dollars a month coming into her just for writing the emails, right?
 And because she's beginning this journey that's going to turn to a multi million dollar business
 By actually doing this service and training and teaching all the other stuff around it
 And and with others as well. So just
 Anyway, just think through that you guys just start thinking about that for yourselves
 You don't have to be good at all these amazing things
 Just pick the little the sliver that you're going to be the best of the world that I go deep there
 And deeper you go the morning mash that craft the more people are going to come to you because they're going to want that thing
 Because you're the best of the world with that piece. So hope that helps
