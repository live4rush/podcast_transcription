 What's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast has been a little while since I've talked to you personally
 That's not completely true. You guys been listening to some of the traffic secrets episodes
 Over the last few weeks, but right now we're recording this episode about two weeks after funnel hacking live 2021 is over
 And I want to share some of the thoughts some of the behind the scenes from the craziness and chaos that happened and
 And how we pulled off the biggest event since the since the coronavirus has hit inside of our industry
 So that's it up to keep things on when I get back we'll hang out and talk about the event
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out of the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, so first off for those who came to funnel hacking live that was so much fun
 Thank you for coming for participating for playing all out those who weren't able to come but but um watch from home
 Thank you as well for for participating. Hope you guys enjoyed it
 It was really cool. This is our first year ever doing a hybrid where we were gonna have people in person and at home
 And honestly like I never told anybody this but about 30 days before funnel hacking live actually happened
 we had to make the decision if if it was going to happen and
 Some of those weird meetings where it's like do we do this or do we not because
 COVID numbers are spiking and all sorts of like just the chaos and you know just all the things that were happening and
 We had to basically put down a down payment on Hogwarts because yes
 We rented Hogwarts for the inner circle and two comical winners
 And so that was like the drop dead like we have to write check right now for I don't know how much was quarter million dollars
 Whatever was right for Hogwarts
 We do this or not because there's no way to get this money back if we decide to not do fun
 Lacking live and I was like wait we may not be doing fun walking live and they're like well
 This is the last shot to change it. I'm like ah, you know, so there's all the fear behind that
 It's finally I was like alright. We're doing it like put the money down like this is happening and then afterwards
 I started because we got closer to the event one of my kids got COVID at school and we're like oh no
 Because I was like I don't really care. I'm not too nervous about getting COVID other than if I get COVID during the event like that would be
 Tragic right like everyone's coming to hear me talk about funnels and stuff
 And if I'm not there or I can't speak or people can get on stage and get their pictures with me or all the different things
 you know get their awards on stage and like I
 Could have it could have ruined the whole event for so many people who put in you know
 Life savings for some people to come and travel here and and to be part of this thing and so
 I got really really nervous and so I started doing everything you can dream of to protect myself and my health
 I was taking every pill and powder you can dream of I had
 my natural path coming and doing IV drips throughout the day
 So I'm like working while I've got bags of stuff hooked to all my veins and like all these you know
 All the chaos to try to make sure that we can stay healthy for the event
 We also normally fly commercial there about like anything I'm you'd like minimize my exposure
 Until the event happens the better so we flew private out there
 And we got to FHL and got their day earlier than I normally do which was actually really nice a chance to kind of see everything and watch things get set up and
 and
 You could tell like there's something about this year
 It was just different like the energy in the hallways and you saw people was just like you could tell people miss being around each other
 Miss networking and all that kind of stuff and so
 Everything started building up towards that and remember the night before so we did our big party at Hogwarts
 we took the
 your circle members and two comic book winners and
 Two comic book Xers and all of our high-end coaching people to Hogwarts and rented the whole thing out
 Which was crazy so gotta be young hang on Diagon Alley and ride
 Green Gots ride and then you know get butter beer and just hang out and network and and it was really a really cool special time for I think everybody
 For me, I had like leave a little early cuz I was like I still love my slides
 You know as Russell normally does in fact I brought we brought our two twins one of them was just like dad
 You're still on your slides like this is crazy. I'm like, I know I just there's so many of them to do and so much that you know
 Anyway, so I'm back home that night and everything ready the next day was but I'm hacking live day
 And I don't know how those who haven't been to our band before we don't start till
 Tell like noon on day one which gives us the morning to keep getting people registered and just gives me the morning to kind of prepare
 Make sure that I'm I'm ready a scary when you start nine
 It means you have to be about like six prepare, you know, it's a day one we we
 Started noon, which is really really nice and this day one was gonna be interesting for a lot of reasons number one
 You know, this is the first time we had a virtual audience at home plus our normal people in the audience
 And so there's kind of that dynamic that we had to kind of figure out at first
 But also this year was our click funnel 7 your birthday and so I got a very beginning and talked about
 Entrepreneurship, excuse me. Excuse me. I have a cough right now. I'm kind of recovering from from
 lacking live honestly anyway, and so
 Initial presentation and then I brought taught out because we had something that we've been secretive and kept secret for the last
 Over a year now, which is which is crazy that kept a secret along here should be so proud of you
 I'm not very good at keeping secrets
 But we announced that that we are about to launch click funnels 2.0 and
 People are crazy. We kind of talked about a little bit
 And I said you guys want to see a video people have actually seen click funnels 2.0 and everyone went crazy
 And so we watched this reveal video of just everybody watching it and like freaking out and then ended and I was like
 Who here wants to click funstupa? Oh, they went crazy and I was like cool tomorrow's our birthday and tomorrow
 We're gonna show you all inside everything and it just like got quiet like just dead quiet
 awkwardly quiet, I was like, oh crap, what do we what do we do now?
 and then I didn't know how to transition fashion when Todd is gonna transition offstage and I was gonna start my next my first like the
 keynote presentation that was gonna give and I
 Did it was just this weird thing and I was like, okay, well, thanks Todd
 He kind of walks off and it's just like I totally messed that that part up, you know
 And then I turned around and look at the audience and they were all just like you're really not gonna show to us right now
 I was like, uh, no if I went to my first presentation
 Excuse me, which was one I was really excited for called advanced funnel audibles
 But because of like the weird energy like I felt like the energy kind of dropped with my
 not giving them every 2.0 and do that next presentation and
 It was a more advanced one and I was so excited for that one
 But I didn't like that one nailed it. I don't know when you're on stage
 You can you can feel like which one's like this crushed it and which one's kind of you like, ah, that didn't quite go perfect, you know?
 And so I did the presentation. I think again, it was great
 But it just didn't like it didn't lamp like energy wasn't like what I wanted when I was sharing that I want that to make kick off and like
 Anyway, so that's kind of you know one of those things where it's like I think I think people who understood what I was talking about right blown away
 And yeah, but the energy just kind of wasn't ah anyway
 This is me resecting guessing everything I go back and read your day number one, but after that then
 Anthony trucks came and spoke on identity shifts and it was he was amazing like
 I've known him for for quite a few years
 But first time I'd ever seen him speak in person and like he just brought like the level of energy and excitement and like that
 He brought was was amazing and just talking about his life and how many times he had had these identity shifts in his life
 And how it affected everything and how to like actually be able to take you know take your identity and
 Consciously change it to build the outcome that you're looking for in life, which was it was really really cool
 So Anthony spoke after that Kaitlyn Poland came spoke
 Which is exciting because I wanted her to show how a lot of times people in our industry in our
 ClickFunnels world they think oh why sell physical products or I sell info products or like you know they
 they have like a
 They have like a thing that they do
 And I was trying to have
 Kaitlyn showed her like no like you have a customer and you serve that customer
 Right and like you do it through all means possible you can sell them information or physical products or supplements or coaching or clothing or
 Whatever like your job is to serve those people and that's the the focal point
 So she showed how they've done that lady boss and how they've grown this huge company because of it and that was really really cool
 After that then we brought Stu McLaren on stage and we were able to give him a check
 For him and his wife's charity called village impact and that's the group I go to Kenya with every
 Man almost every year seems like we're going in March. I believe as long as it doesn't get canceled, but
 When we first launched ClickFunnels we set up where every time somebody builds a funnel
 We donated dollar towards village impact and so this year's check was crazy over $200,000
 Which was so cool and it's gonna help so many amazing kids over in Africa. So that was really fun
 And then we also had a chance to launch a new
 a new site we built for
 For operation around railroad called to save a child challenge and so we launched that at the at Funhacking Live
 which was really really cool as well and
 And that was kind of everything before dinner
 And then we fed everyone dinner there to keep people close around and then that night we did workshops
 You know typically if you've been to Funhacking Live in the past we do these like round tables and everybody has a chance to be round
 round tables, but because of COVID restrictions and stuff without it be better to
 Just to break out rooms kind of so we had four breakout rooms
 So Jim Edwards went and talked about copywriting and he helped everybody actually build out their customer avatar
 Which was which is really cool because it's the foundation of all copy where more people never even do that
 So you got them to actually build that out which was really really cool
 Katherine Jones was back this year again and she talked about
 Funnels and building funnels and she did an amazing job as well Rachel Miller came and talked about free traffic
 which was
 Really cool and then Myron Golden talked about sales and so
 Those four people were running these these hour-long workout
 Workshop rooms and while I was sitting there I was like supposed to be doing this other presentation that I was really excited for
 But like I was cool kind of bun but my earlier presentations were like ah I want to give this I just want to go home
 I'm so tired. I want to go to bed
 It's been such a long stressful day, you know and also people start filling back in the rooms
 I'm like, oh man, I got to do this and so I got stage
 I did this my second presentation for the day which was called virtual real estate secrets and
 For whatever reason I never know which ones are gonna hit or not hit
 But for every reason the energy during that presentation like nailed it like people were excited. They were on fire
 They're just excited about the possibilities when I was showing them was like I've talked about before in this podcast
 But you know sometimes we talk about trying to build this huge empire
 We're gonna have tons of followers and fans and you know all these kind of things
 But the reality is there's other ways to make money online, too
 And I talked about how like in real estate you can buy a house and you can flip it
 You can buy it and you can rehab it you can buy it and you can put renters
 They like there's all these things you do it with with real estate and make the same things with virtual real estate
 With little websites these little funnels
 And so I had like probably dozen examples of little businesses that I've built that are just kind of running on autopilot
 my little virtual real estate empire and I kind of showed those things and
 Anyway, I think it was really cool to think a lot of people like it opened their mind of like oh my gosh
 I could do that I could do that and I started helping them just have ideas of ways that they could get started easily without the
 Stress about you know, what's my message gonna be and what's my who my people and all the things?
 I think a lot of people get nervous about so you go don't worry about that right now
 Let's just make some small business make a business cash flows you a hundred bucks or five hundred bucks or a thousand bucks
 Like these are really easy to do when you understand the basics
 So that was a really fun one and now that wrapped up day number one
 Which was which was really cool. So anyway, I'm gonna do a couple episodes kind of talking about some of the core
 things
 that we that we didn't event
 You know
 Throughout all so talk about the things we do during the event to help
 Stimulate sales later in the event because you guys come to me you want to learn marketing. So how do we use funnel hacking live?
 How do we did we use it to?
 generate well over ten million dollars from the event and so I'll talk about some of those things but it all started day
 Number one day number one the goal is to like blow their minds get them
 Where they're like man, this is all I got this was still worth it right
 That's the first thing we want people thinking and then also is helping them understand that like there's a vision bigger than you
 So you've never noticed it fun locking live day number one
 We always have some kind of charity component where they're watching me give money to charity and then also we're asking them to give money to charity
 Because it helps to trade people on like, you know, how to how does the room work if you're gonna give somebody money?
 Where do you go? Like where's the back of the room? Where's the table?
 but also it shows that like, you know me and Todd who are
 The ones who run this company and run the event like that were that we don't just you know say this stuff
 We we practice we preach like we're donating money. We're giving money in fact
 You'll notice we'll talk about this later about day four like whatever many people give to
 To say the save a child challenge we matched it and so
 You know, we're trying to show that like hey, we we also are doing these things too
 I'm not asking you anything that that we're not willing to do as well and so it all kind of starts with that day number one is
 Blowing their minds making them see that like, you know that you're you're doing the same things you're asking them to do
 And just giving them a really good experience and that's kind of how the very beginning of fun
 I came I went this year 2021 so those who were there if you enjoyed it, please
 You know take a picture of this podcast episode and tag me in it and let me know what your biggest favorite thing was from day number one
 There's so many cool speakers so many cool things
 For me my favorite thing I think was my last presentation when I
 Did the virtual relative presentation I can feel like the energy was like perfect and everyone was so excited that and also like the initial launch 2.0
 You know like I did the whole like teasing thing and everyone's energy drop
 It was still cool to be able to finally talk about this thing
 We've been talking about for so long. We're so excited to share with the world. So
 Anyway, there's day number one at funnel hacking live
