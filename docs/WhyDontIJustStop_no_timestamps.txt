 Good morning everybody. This is Russell Brunson. I welcome you to the marketing stickers podcast. It's so sad to have you here
 Let's get started
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. We'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing stickers
 All right everybody so
 Today wish we talk about today. I know exactly what I'm talking about today. So
 My kids started wrestling practice this week, which has been amazing
 I love it only downside is I have to leave the office every day three which means I lose like two and a half hours of
 Productivity each day, which is tough, right? But it's been so much fun
 Like I love it my daughter's being a stack girl this year - which is really cool
 So I get like hanging out with all my three kids every day and then drive home with them and talk about fun stuff
 And it's not really special. So I wouldn't trade those moments for anything
 But right now over the next 10 days we also have three events happening
 Number one is speaking at Justin Williams
 Flip hacking live
 Justin Terry you guys have heard from talk about them in the past as one of my favorite people and I don't normally speak at people's events anymore
 But they asked me nicely and I just really like them. So I said yes, and I'm also I'm doing a new
 Form of my presentation one that if it does well
 I'm gonna be using for our speaker team
 Which we've been building out and I'm also gonna be using it at the 10x event in front of 35,000 people
 So it's a good opportunity for me to test my material as I was telling you guys earlier
 So that's been really fun the next day. We're going to Salt Lake because
 Andrew Warner who runs mixture g podcast is my favorite interviewer ever like I listen to podcast just because I love
 Hearing the way he interviews people
 You know like a lot of people interviews don't really like us much but him like he fascinates me and I have an interview
 I was podcast twice, but I was like I want I want him to do it
 Like a deep dive interview on the ClickFunnels startup story
 Because the mixture g is all about startup stories and I asked him I'm like hey
 Like we need to put on an event would you come interview me for like two or three hours and just and he was like sure
 And so we did that so like this Saturday. He's doing that which is really cool
 So I know a lot of you guys who are down you targeting to come into that
 And then before that with JPCers coming to do stand-up comedy, which is gonna be insane
 So that's happening on Saturday then if I home I'm home for two days again
 And then Wednesday I fly out because we have the big traffic secrets event
 Which is because I am in the process right in traffic secrets book and I found the easiest way to write a book
 It's an event first where you teach everything and you find out what again is testing material right what makes sense
 What doesn't make sense what stakes what doesn't stick and so
 Man, I've rode out when I late ten times last night finally we came up with this new format that
 Really proud of and excited, but there's a lot of work to do
 In fact, I have eight presentations. I have not started creating yet that I have to create by next Wednesday
 On top of everything else and I'm still working on the presentation for
 For the Friday event, so it's just kind of it's a lot of chaos mucking a lie and last night's up like 130 working on it
 I got early this morning work on it and my wife
 Asked me she's like, why are you doing this like you're in a point of life. You should not be stressed and should not be tired
 She had me doing all these things
 Which makes you ponder I like why am I doing this stuff?
 You know like companies growing whether I do this or not
 Money's coming in whether this or not impacts happening whether I do not like why am I doing this like what's the purpose?
 And so makes you think and you know first off it
 Is it because the significance like I need to feel more significant and I would say I'm sure that's a piece of it
 Right like there's something about working hard and creating and doing like makes you feel good about yourself makes you feel
 Significant so I'm sure that's a piece of it. So yes, I do want significance
 It's probably why I'm doing it's probably why I'm telling you guys because like I get that that hit of you guys
 And like whoa Russell works so hard and I'm like it feels good
 Even though it's a stupid reason like significance is like the stupidest. Oh, anyway, I hate significance
 But we've got it we've all got it and so yeah, I'm sure that's probably a big part of where I'm doing it
 what else
 Legacy like there's something about writing books that like leaves, I don't know
 Books are like the most I don't know when I when I pass away
 My books are the things I only say two things my family number one my family is the thing that I leave behind right?
 I think that's really the biggest impression of who you are is that
 We've talked a lot about that during the podcast David Oma K said
 No success can compensate for failure in the home
 So that's why I'm carving out so much time to go be the kids like that's the number one right?
 So I think that legacy of your family and your kids is big
 But then the second side like the reason I'm writing another book and like I don't have timed write a book
 But I have to write it
 you know what I mean like
 But like there's something about the legacy of it like the Docom Secrets Book and Expert Secrets book so far have been like such a cool thing to see how
 How they they stick and they spread and people's lives are impacted by them
 And I want that with traffic secrets and then we're gonna be putting those three books into a box that which is so cool
 Which gives them more significance hit right so there's more significance for you
 So there's significance of legacy which both are more significance. So then it's like okay is it all about me?
 It's that why I'm doing this and I try to sit back and think I'm like well if it was all about me like
 Why wouldn't I just stop or just take a nap or just you know?
 And so there's there's that thing and it's like well part of me's like just driving force like we had um
 Last night one of the people in our community. She's a she's a masseuse
 She's also doing click fun with my own stuff and been fun watching her journey over the last year so
 and
 And last night she came over and gave a clip I had massage our house. It was really cool fact man two things happened this week
 I had the person normally cuts my hair I had them come her come my house cut my hair
 Which was insane and then I had and the suits came to our house
 Which was insane there's something about that?
 It's funny I had this conversation with Dana Derek's a little while ago
 Through voxer he was like I'm driving my haircut
 I feel like it's such a waste of time the opportunity cost to be in my haircut is insane like I could spend
 You know a hundred bucks 200 bucks 300 bucks in my haircut and they came to me
 You'd be worth it because I'm not wasting that time driving
 You know the opportunity cost of my time to drive you a haircut
 And everything she said that I was wanted my haircut girl to come to my house
 I come my hair and I'd never dare to then she finally she quit where she was working out I'm like
 Since you quit actually had Melanie Melanie she got some only hair hair to I'm like like you find out
 She can come to my house and stay because that'd be awesome and she said yes
 And so now she goes my house got my hair which like saves me so much time and energy and effort and
 Anyway, I digress so the girl came and gave us massages
 She's awesome and and she was talking about her new funnel and she's on the supplement and some things
 She's doing and she's like I'm working on the traffic now and like I think about that
 I was like oh like I told her my oh my books coming out. It's gonna help you so much like I
 Can feel like as soon as you have this piece it's gonna help you even more and it was funny because she told me during the massage
 She's like you know click for all this change my life
 She's made so much easier and I'm able to do these things and and she's like thank you so much for creating this thing
 That's changed my this changed our business and change what we're doing and I feel like I like I feel like I got two-thirds of it
 Right the dot-com secret book gave people like funnel structure
 Expert seeks gave them like how to do storytelling and things you need to be able to convert to the funnels
 And this is like the last piece like how do you fill those funnels with people who want to buy your stuff?
 And like I feel like that's the missing piece or community the people that are struggling to people can't get traffic
 And I feel like there's gonna be a storm coming
 I feel like and it may be I'm not I may be I'm wrong. I hope I'm wrong
 But I've lived through the Google Slap
 and then more Google Slaps and then you know
 this thing after thing after thing I've lived through the the ups and downs of a network and
 You know Facebook came and then there were some big huge ups
 They went down a little bit there some ups again and right now we're kind of this limbo zone where it's gonna inch and see what Zuckerberg does
 long term by just knowing
 Platform owners they usually end up screwing us over at some point so I'm preparing for that
 I'm like man if I don't prepare our community
 For that when the when the when the tide changes, right?
 If they're not prepared as a whole like a lot of people who lose their businesses and I'm like this book for me
 It's like a safety net, but it's like it's like I got to create the things is a safety net for our community
 I'm where it's 60 think 68,000 members yesterday. I saw active members
 I like I have this responsibility then like I got to protect you
 I have to give you the tools and the training and the structure you need because when this tide shifts
 I just know that if it shifts and Facebook stops being amazing
 I remember Google that first time everyone's doing Google PVC
 This is like 12 13 years ago and everyone's killing the thing when they slapped everyone
 Most people didn't know what to do and it was a couple years for people to recover and most people didn't recover by the way
 Most people I know who were killing it back then are no longer around right now
 But those who were able to hold it out for the two to three years before they could figure out the next phase
 those the ones that survived and
 Then you know then SEO was the thing and then slap and then so lads were thinking then that shift it like
 There's just been these shifts up and down and I'm like I feel like my job and my calling in this in this
 This platform I have this spot is to protect our audience and to and to prepare them for what's coming ahead, right?
 And I feel that I can see it. I know it's gonna happen
 So the traffic seekers book is something that's slap proof right like the way I'm trying to teach it and structure is not like
 Here's a shiny object that they here's how to do target interest targeting on Facebook like because that's gonna come and go like
 I want this book to be evergreen so that no matter what the ups and downs are no matter what the pitfalls matter what the
 the you know what tempest
 Tries to destroy you you'll be prepared for and you'll be able to just easily shift and move to the next thing
 You know and it's been interesting, you know
 And I this is like in my 15th year in this business and I can tell you the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
 I've seen you come and gone
 And it's usually during these shifts that they disappear they get really good at one way of driving traffic and then it shifts
 And they lose their own entire business. So that's my my job my goal with this
 New book is to prepare people. So I feel like that's the bigger calling
 is
 to
 Know do you guys feel that same way about your audience? I hope you do we feel like this this
 You feel indebted to them to be able to like
 Or if it's your job your role like protect them and like and it makes sure they have what they need and I think for me
 I know that's like the biggest drawing force. It's like pulling me
 To do the stuff this weekend to tell a quick from a sharp story because you're gonna see the ups and the downs and the ups and the downs
 You know to create this presentation that
 That I can give to a speaker team
 So these guys can go out and just spread out our message to be able to do this event on traffic seekers
 So that I the outline for the books and the book can be published and so I can get that out to you
 So you've got the framework you need to be protected during the the upcoming days. So
