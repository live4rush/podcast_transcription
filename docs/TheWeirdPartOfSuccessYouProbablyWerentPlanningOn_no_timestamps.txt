 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome you to the marketing secrets podcast today
 I want to talk to you about something that as you strive and success is gonna happen to you
 And it's gonna throw a lot of you guys off because it's not something that makes a lot of sense
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody welcome back
 all right, I'm pumped for today's episode because
 part of me it caused a little fire under me and then I realized I forgot that like this happens and
 And I think that happens to a lot of people and it either keeps them from success or it keeps them like the fear of it keeps
 from success or
 Or worse to have some success and happens and then it causes like downward spirals
 Check out those who were watching there's our fail all the snow's melted which are playing somewhere out there anyway
 so
 This is interesting so as you are growing up in life and you were surrounded and you start getting your network of friends and family
 and all sorts of stuff right and what's interesting is like your friends your family you like them all right because they connect you they
 understand you and
 the greatest thing happens like
 when people are miserable or they mess up or they have problems or whatever
 People relate to them right it's a weird thing. It's like if you're sick everyone relates to you
 like oh I'm so sorry you're sick
 Oh, and if you're like I'm overweight like oh, I'm so sorry over wait like oh I'm broke
 Oh, my boss sucks. Oh my job. Oh school. I hate like when you're miserable
 Everyone will instantly jump in and empathize F empathy with you right and it's really really nice
 And we get connection from that and we build friendships and things like that are interesting
 And this is like the worst you are the worst things are happening to you more people keep you low connection
 Which is why a lot of people live in this zone where they just stay miserable because the more miserable
 They are more love and connection they get and more significant they get and a bunch of other weird things even though it seems
 Backward trip something weird is gonna happen to all of you guys if you listen to this podcast and you're gonna be successful
 And so you're going to go out there and start doing things differently and you're gonna be trying things and working holy castle
 when someone's hit me
 We try these differently and you're thinking differently and like and and
 And it's gonna be weird and you have these friends around you and you're gonna be excited and be telling these stories
 And at first they're gonna be like watching you fail and like they're gonna be there for your failures
 They're like rally with you and they're gonna like be there and then something's gonna happen
 You're gonna figure this game out and your time success and the weirdest thing happens you think
 All your friends are gonna come back to you and be like oh man you haven't success and big you assume
 They're gonna be happy for you because they've been miserable for you with you
 But they you assume and all of us are the same way we assume that
 The because these people were miserable with us that they're gonna be happy with this and the weirdest thing happens
 When you have success all these people who you thought we were really close friends who you thought we're gonna be
 Grateful and excited happy for success you get it and then guess what happens?
 They're not happy for your success
 It's the weirdest thing and it causes these weird emotional
 Mental things for us as entrepreneurs were it's like I don't give these are my best friends
 Why aren't they happy that having success and it's sabotaging a lot of times just look back to not being successful
 Cuz you're like you know what screw that I want my friends like me
 I'm gonna be I'm gonna be miserable and then like you'll mess up in the book. Oh come here
 We're all friends again. It's the weirdest thing so I wanted to share with you
 I've had a couple things which recently that there's this guy that used to go to church with and I didn't really know him that well
 I kind of knew of him and it's crazy apparently he messaged me on LinkedIn. This is like
 Seven or eight years ago when I first started going to church there and he messaged me on LinkedIn
 And I didn't I had LinkedIn account and logged in and I didn't know about it
 And somebody told me like four or five years later that like he was he was saying that I was really rude or something
 I'm like I've never even talked to me for and I was like find out why and apparently because I never responded to his LinkedIn message
 So rule number one don't sing people are reading where you're messaging them crazy
 So I wrote as I log in Lincoln
 I searched through like five or six years of back message and I found it
 I was like oh man, so I mentioned I'm sorry like I'm on Facebook
 I don't I don't check LinkedIn. I apologize anyways like oh no worries man. It's all cool
 So my guy right over so then I ended moving go to different
 Different what we call in the Mormon Church called more so same church different wards a different area different group
 Congregation or everyone call it so I'm in this other congregation and just doing my thing and and like honestly
 You guys know this cuz you're here like I'm just doing my thing right like I am obsessed with the art of what I do
 So this is like me painting like this is business and entrepreneurship is like this is my art
 So I'm doing it and then I'm obsessed with like the success of people going through that's what we've been in the last
 Like last we had a we had a fat event last week and in the 3d a fat event with 18 people spent two comic-club awards like it's crazy
 We're doing multiple two comic club like making multiple people millionaires a day right now
 And it's like that's what I'm passionate about right and I'm so fired for the people's success
 We've got I think 10 to 12 people who passed eight figures this year and like it's crazy
 It's like that's what I'm excited about right so apparently one of my friends comes up to me
 It's like hey, you know so and so I'm like yeah, how's he doing? He's like
 You know, he's he's doing all right, but like
 And it's telling his conversation. They had I guess in this conversation. He's like I'm not impressed with Russell
 I'm not pressing anything. He's done
 Like well tell him next we talked to him that my job
 I'm not trying to impress him like I'm doing my art and try to make people successful and just blew my mind like that guy
 Like I don't know that well, but like he should be happy for me
 I'm hoping other people and helping tons of love success like why are they happy and it's the weirdest thing
 There's a person in not my not my me family, but in my family
 Same kind of thing and I won't I won't tell too much the story because he knows maybe they listen I doubt it
 I'm pretty sure they don't but
 Apparently every time somebody talks about click funnels in the family this person will like stand up and walk out
 because they're like so
 Frustrated and upset about whatever I don't even know it doesn't make sense to me
 So I just want to warn you guys I sure as you start having success
 A lot of people you love and care about around you who you think should be excited for your success
 They're not gonna be it's gonna be hard and you're like what like I thought you guys love me and they're like yeah, they they love
 I don't know I'm ever sitting Tony Robbins event upw and he was talking about this about like you know
 Like when you're a fan of what they all love you but C-shirt losing weight and you're eating healthy then they're like
 Oh, well, he's and like it instantly just turns on you
 So I just want you guys to be prepared for that be one for it and to understand it's not their fault. They just love
 I don't know there's something about when like they can relate to the unhappiness
 They can relate to not having successful and so it's like when you start succeeding and doing these things it scares them to death and
 They're scared that you're gonna that you're gonna progress past them or scared you're gonna leave them or whatever those things are
 A lot of times it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because they start not being happy for your success when you fail
 They're secretly like hoping you'll fail there like because they want you back to where they were at saying connect with you still
 And so don't let that be a thing keeps you back because you've got a gift you've got something that you're amazing
 Yeah, there's something that you can do to change the world and if you
 If you if you succumb to that
 You're gonna lose that on that and people's lives won't be changed because of that and there's Mr. James p-fural driving in behind me
 Anyway, I just want to shut because I'm sure some of you guys either hit that or you're gonna hit that
 And just be aware of it and second side of that is like when people have success like be
 Excited for them be that person who's like man you lost weight congratulations. Oh man. You're making money
 That's awesome. Oh like all like be the person's excited
 I'm generally pumped when people are successful and it makes me laugh because I meet people all time
 I'm like and they like talk about their successes and they go like they're not proud of it
 Be or like they're proud of it
 But they're afraid talk about cuz they know that people come back and like oh well yet, man
 You sounds like you're lucky. Oh good timing for you like good time like
 I have people told me before like I remember when I won my first state title
 I had a friend who's had started wrestling since he'd be equipped
 He's like oh well if I would kept wrestling I'd be a state champ too and like no you wouldn't you quit like by definition
 You never would have like ah
 Right successful business and people like oh, yeah, well, you know, oh man
 I can rise with some what's I had somewhere and some nasty so I can't tell I could tell my guy
 This would happen like wow man. I guess so lucky. I wish I could find something like that Mike you kidding me so
 You remember the last like 15 years while you were like goofing off working nine to five and going to bed at night
 Yeah, I wasn't I wasn't lucky. I freaking worked my face off and
 Yeah, and so
 It's just funny cuz people people are afraid to talk about that so when you meet somebody whoa
 We need somebody and they tell you something about themselves. It's excited. I'm probably gonna I'm living there
 I'm probably nervous and scared
 Instead of being like I don't know just be pumped for be excited tell them like holy crap
 That's amazing and like pump them up because if you do that you'll track more people like that and that's gonna make everything easier
 For you and your life better. So there you go. It helps. How foggy is here in Boise today foggy all weekend long
 It's kind of cool anyway
 So to end this off when you guys know I'm proud of you. I'm pumped for you
 I'm excited for you the more success you have happier
 I am all I care about is your success and
 Yeah, find people in strength so people are the same way and become that kind of a person. All right. Peace. See you guys
