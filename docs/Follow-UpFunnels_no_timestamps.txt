 What's up everybody welcome back to mark instakers podcast today
 We're gonna talk about what I call the often overlooked second funnel that's invisible to the naked eye
 We also call these follow-up funnels and I'm gonna show you guys a really cool case study about how basically made
 $16.49 for every one dollar remains out of our actual funnel that is the power of follow-up funnels
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast. I'll give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody so you probably gonna be talking about follow-up funnels before
 But I'm gonna take it as kind of the history behind this and why it's important and what you should do and a whole bunch
 Other cool stuff so when I first got started on
 Online marketing way back in the day back then everyone used to use email autoresponders
 Which you know we still use variations of those today
 But I remember it came out and what would happen is that you would someone was subscribed to your email list
 Then you'd write a pre-written out email sequence right so we used to back in the day when I first got started
 It was always like sign up for my free five-day e-course like that was the thing everyone did everyone had a free five-day
 Course so someone dropped in and then they give you the email address and the the follow-up funnel was like a five-day email course
 Day number one you'd be like here's this first thing second thing third thing fourth thing fifth thing and the fifth day
 You'd ask them to buy the thing you're trying to sell. That's how this thing first started for me
 Then remember fast forward who knows a year too later
 I was hanging out with a guy named Matt basic and Matt told me at the time
 I can't remember exactly what it was but if it's something like he's like yeah, I sat down
 I wrote out 600 emails. I built a little email sequence
 So some of them joins my list they can email me if like 600 days or something
 I was like holy cow
 My thoughts and same like imagine if I just do that once I write this huge sequence and then put people through it
 I'll never have to worry about writing emails again
 I'll just like add people to my list and that was like my thoughts
 Then I started trying to write a huge follow up funnel like that a huge email sequence
 And I got like five days in I was like I want to die this is really really hard
 So I stopped and then it's over the next like two decades of my career
 I tried so many times to start one to start one you know
 To start started writing one and I get tired and then I write it and then I remember one time I wrote it
 I put it all inside a get response no for students a webber first
 I wrote like a I don't know 20 email sequence in a webber and I was gonna keep adding to it
 And so I built it out I started adding people my list and then a webber
 Cancel my count and I was like what the dump I was so mad
 And so then I went over and I rebuilt entire sequence and get response
 But I was gonna import my same list I couldn't do the same email so I'd rewrite the entire thing
 So I spent like two weeks rewriting that same email sequence
 Then I imported my list they started the emails and within like two days get response cancel my count
 I was like I'm going nuts like I can't do this and so I gave up on it again and then click funnels came out one of the powerful things
 About click funnels is when you build out your your follow-up sequence you can plug in any SNTP
 So that's basically you can plug in send grid or you can plug in
 Amazon s3 emails you can plug in and there's a bunch of ones you can plug in so that way with the one the reasons
 Why we did that because I had had so many headaches where we had launched an email sequence in the our email server
 So I shut us off and I go rebuild it. It was a nightmare whereas in click funnels
 Let's say you you build out your sequence you upload a list of customers and start getting the email sequence
 Let's say send grid shuts you down
 You can just plug in a different SMTP and emails keep going that you won't lose a beat
 And it's we built that because I was like that's how I need it for myself because I don't want to write these again
 So we did that I wrote initial email sequence of probably down on 10 or 12 days
 And then that's all I ever got to and
 About that time when we launched this new feature site click funnels like we needed name for it right is an odd responder sequence
 Is it marketing automation is it like what is that we need a name and we kept trying back and forth?
 This is before funnel hacking live 2017 right?
 We need a name for this like what's it called like and I remember Stephen Larson's here in the office
 And he was like super stressed out trying to figure out this name trying to figure out this name
 And I think he told me when prayed in the corner something came back to me so later
 He's like what about follow-up funnels. I was like oh my gosh
 That's what this is like someone comes in they give you your email address
 They go through normal funnel and then they're added to your follow-up funnel
 You follow up with them you take them through sequence and so we bought follow-up funnels calm
 And they got became the thing and that became the branding and so I ever since 2017 now so at 21 or - 21 years
 four years I've been calling and follow-up funnels and so for me that's what it is you have your funnels and then your follow-up funnels and
 And so it was interesting is as I was writing the dot com secrets book actually prior to that
 I was I was I was doing a presentation for funnel hacking at 2017 and actually shared this case study in the dot com secrets book
 I'm sure at the years right now is I wanted to see like how valuable is an actual follow-up funnel and so we started looking at like
 Our funnels and how much money they make when somebody comes through like a book funnel right and look through that revenue
 And then instead okay over the next 30 days from our email follow-up funnel
 How much money do you make we start looking the math and the numbers and what was crazy in the snapshot?
 I took this is it was 2017. So I think it was December of 2016
 I took the snapshot and what was crazy is that for every one dollar that we made inside of an actual funnel
 So my book funnel my webinar funnel whatever was every one dollar remained inside of a funnel within 30 days made
 $16.49 through our follow-up funnel
 What what the dump right?
 He has never heard me said expression before it's a weird one
 I had a friend in college used to always say what the dump and it's stuck and it's weird
 I don't know but you're getting it today. So I was like what the dump like that's amazing like that's
 For every one dollar I put in I get $16.49 back out if that doesn't make any sense and
 It started to give me re-excited about concept to follow funnels and so for
 Years I sat down and kept like mapping out camera, right?
 I'm gonna build you're not like a map basic 600 email sequence
 I want to build a sequence that goes through all my core offers my products and something
 It's kind of you know
 I started looking at that and so we started sitting down and building went out and and every time I tried to build out
 I got so big I was like it's gonna be 50 email six emails and I get stressed out. I was like
 Anyway, I'm sure you guys have gone through that. It's kind of overwhelming and stressful
 but finally
 Last year during COVID I was like all right we're building this thing out and so I sat down and I mapped out okay
 If someone comes in my world like what are all the offers and the videos and YouTube videos and the podcast
 It's like what are the best things that I have would be the sequence
 I would send somebody through like my mom and join my list like what would I want her to have first and second and third and I
 Mapped out the sequence and the sequence ended up being about 60 emails and and then I went through and I was like
 How am I gonna write 60 emails like that just sounds like pain?
 I want to die just thinking about it, right?
 So I got out voxer and I would vox
 Each email so I just kind of say it and I had my brother go and get it all transcribed and send me back the transcripts
 And from there I take these these transcripts. I could write emails a lot faster
 And so I started doing that and we started building out the sequence and it was six like I said 60 emails
 Going over about a three-month period time
 So it wasn't every day, but sometimes it was three or four days in a row and we take three days off and the back and forth
 We built out this really really cool sequence and I got it done and then over the last
 60 days or so we've been slowly adding people into the top of this sequence in fact as of
 Okay, as a friday, we had added 1 million
 734,577 people into this funnel and we were getting an average overall engagement at 22%
 22% of people are opening every single email
 Which is pretty exciting, but now it's 1.7 million and this is another
 I think a million and a half so emails being added in over the next like probably next
 30 to 45 days being added to the top of the funnel trying to go slowly so that alveson
 You know, we don't blow up our email like, you know
 You go all the sudden start sending a million emails at just anyway
 So we've been slowly adding these people in every single day and so 1.7 million have gone into it 20% open rate
 and now they're getting the sequence of
 60 emails over the next three months and what's been crazy and cool and exciting is that
 First off, I haven't had to write an email for a long time, which is like who kind of nice second off
 I'm watching this now because I have a lot of funnels
 And so much email sequence links people different funnels and then videos and podcast episodes like again
 Some things are selling some things are training some things are free some things are paid
 But just kind of moving them through the logical sequence of of offers of content of things
 I want people to get into experience and it connects people to all these different things and then
 How it's fun as I'm watching this now. I'm like
 Um, now this is done
 Every single funnel across our business now is is lifting. It's really crazy
 Our best converting videos are more people or views are popping and they're spiking and like like
 It's one of the things what the entire company as a whole is lifting and revenue and engagement and all these things
 All by placing the thing in place
 Um, and it you know, I've been fighting this for I mean honestly it's been two decades since I finally first wanted to this
 I actually finally did it
 Excuse me. And now it's just insane watching what's happening and we plugged in so someone opts into any of my funnels anywhere at any given time
 They go through that little mini usually some of the options in the funnel
 There's a little mini sequence they go through for three or four days and then it drops into this big major
 Major sequence that takes them through all of the the offers in chronological order
 Um, so we're adding again about 1000 to 2000 people a day and actually more than that. Excuse me
 Pretty closely 3,500 or so options a day are being added in this funnel as well
 So it keeps growing and growing and growing and I'm watching this now as the entire ecosystem of click funnels is all rising together
 Because of this this funnel that's in place and now it's nice
 It's because it's 60 days long
 Um, everybody goes into my into my world is going to be getting these for the rest of time until I decided to change them up
 I'm doing or tweak them and hopefully I never will because I spend so much time and so much effort working on them
 Um, and it's just it's it's really really cool
 So a couple of things number one if you've been getting a new email sequence from me pay attention
 Okay, I think I'm gonna eventually put this whole email sequence into a book call it fall out funnels and like it'll be a be a really cool product
 but
 Um, man, I know you guys are getting it for free
 So if not go opt into any of my forums and eventually they start getting it the first email is something like
 About marketing secrets like who wants marketing secrets and so that's how you know the first email is coming through
 But um, it's powerful man is blowing our business away
 So I want to share with you guys because I want you start thinking now that you've been creating more things right you got some funnels
 You got some videos you got a podcast you got content you got things you're putting out there like think about this
 My my thought when I was creating this follow up funnels like if my mom was to come to my world
 Would be the first thing I'd want her to engage with and that was the second thing and the third thing and the fourth thing
 I would look at this this logical sequence of events and then from that
 um
 That's how I write my email sequence and um, and then you get it all together when it's done man
 It's this thing that's just like literally hand holding all your dream customers around
 Um, the logical sequencing of your content and your and your offers and how powerful is that like what would that do for your business?
 If you have that right now, I tell you for us here at click funnels. It is um, we're already seeing this and this entire lifting across the board
 Um, and it's powerful and some people come to our world and like they see a webinar and that's all they know and they're gonna see a book
 And they see something random, but they don't have the context of everything we're doing
 So by doing this puts everybody into a sequence where they're getting step by step piece by piece the stuff we want them to understand
 In the order we need them to understand them. That's really the magic in the power
 So anyway, I want to share with you guys because I'm pumped about it
 It's working you don't have your own follow up funnels now is the time to start building them out creating them
 Um, plug them into click funnels. I guess they do it in the click funnel so you don't
 Risk getting shut down which happens in too much every other otter spawner sequence I've ever had in fact I think in the slides I talked about that
 um
 Uh, because we're this is the very first time I told people about
 Um our fault funnels inside of click phones. We announced it
 So okay, so in the past um a webber shut me down six times get responsible
 Not four times eye contact should be done nine times infusion soft two times act campaign two times
 middle chimps from now three times
 And that's
 That's it. Um, and so I would be careful of using any other outside our responders for that reason
 We have some crazy updates coming click funnels in the very near future with our follow up funnels and stuff
 I think you were gonna go crazy for can't announce that yet, but um
 Anyway good stuff's coming. So um, I just want to share with you guys because it it matters
 It's important it's something I fought forever and I wish I would have done this 10 years ago and just read it every year
 We tweaked it every single year whenever that might be um, but now it's done and now it's just it's the same
 So again from the snapshot of december for every one dollar we made it inside of our
 Our core funnel we're driving people to who made 16 dollars and 40 incense inside the follow funnel
 Which is crazy?
 Um, and what I'm finding now now I have a sequence is even better those numbers are just going up
 And so I want to share with you guys hope this helps time to build the follow up funnel
 Hope this inspires you motivation gets you excited to build the often overlooked second funnel that's invisible to naked eye
 It's called a follow up funnel without saying she has I appreciate you all and I'll talk to you all again soon. Bye everybody
