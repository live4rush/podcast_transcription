 Hey, what's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing seekers podcast
 I'm still laying in bed, but I got one more thought for you that I just got to share
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet
 Still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 All right, so I
 Know I just finished the last episode and I was about to go to bed and then
 Todd and I were talking about this concept and then I started googling it and I found a image and a diagram and it just
 So excited guys share with you, okay, so
 what we're talking about is
 Back in the early days of quick funnels right like when the whole thing started and we didn't have any money to afford the
 You know 40 developers who are in the office today and the 200 support people her home working for you and all the other
 You know the entire team that is that is amazing that is here to support click funnels
 And which we're talking about like just the good old days and what happened and how we would like police hackathons
 And I was funny because we decided to go to bed at you know 11 30 tonight
 And we're funny because we're like back before when we were like broke and poor and hustling and we had to like
 You know we were pulling the all-nighters five six seven eight nights in a row just to get
 Funnels live and so many guys probably if you've been binge listening to this podcast and you've you've heard
 Those episodes I'm driving home at four in the morning like I'm doing sepsos
 I won't fall asleep and I won't die like they haven't more than once right and if you haven't listened to this
 Go to marketing seekers comm slash binge and down with the binge guide to go binge listen to all the episodes because I've been going on this journey with you guys
 Anyway, so we're just reminiscing about that and how right we've got more money now
 But we should you know so we should go to bed
 But we miss the good old days and like how fun it be if we just like lock like what on vacation lock ourselves in class and just build a team
 again
 And anyway, we're talking about that Todd said he was written article or solid post or something
 About how there's like three core personalities that you have to have in a startup and it was fascinating because if you look at
 the original founders of ClickFunnels there were three of us
 shortly thereafter we brought in a
 Partner a few partners and then the team members and then they grew from there
 But initially there were and it's funny. It's as he said this. I was like, oh my gosh. That was true with us
 Right, so if you look at the three co-founders of ClickFunnels
 Originally number one well
 I'll get taught number one Todd number one right and if you look at the archetype of his role
 Pulling image. He is the hacker or the engineer right? So the hacker number two then
 Was our second co-founder?
 He's no longer a part of the company because when the original co-founder same was Dylan and Dylan is the hipster or the designer and
 Then for three you have to have a hustler
 Who's like the entrepreneur who's out there drumming up business and selling stuff, right?
 So the three the three
 architects three fan the three types you need is is a hacker a hipster and a hustler
 So the hacker the hipster the hustler and we're dying laughing so like oh my gosh that is true
 Like Todd was the hacker and hacked together software and like we didn't have a big development team
 So the Todd had to do everything from database administration to coding to front end to back end to like all that stuff
 Right, so it was just him then and designer like Dylan was doing the UI design and the graphic design and the logo design
 And the sales letter design and the other stuff right and hustler like I was writing copy
 I was doing webinars. I was making phone calls. I was doing JV's like
 And initially it's just it's just that's what is the hipster the hacker and the hustler. So that was awesome
 And then the other thing as I was googling this time looking at it
 There was one kind of caveat center here said that this phase of the business the startup phase where there's a hipster
 The hacker the hustler says that the founder is or was the target user of what they were creating
 That's like oh my gosh. That's so
 So true like when you start a new startup
 What is it you're creating right when you create a new info product or new software company or a supplement company whatever
 Like you the founder you are the target market or you the target user
 That's why you don't have to get focus groups and have people go out there and like
 researching and talking to customers all that stuff because you are the customer right like
 That's why click someone's works the wells because I I am you right? I am an aunt
 I'm the I am our dream customer in fact as I'm working with the dev team today and we're talking
 It was like it was kind of funny cuz I was like I am the biggest hyper user of click fun
 It's like I feel the pains as much if not more than every other member on our platform like anything you guys are frustrated by
 I promise you I'm a hundred times more frustrated by which why we you know
 We care about what you guys are doing because we care about ourselves like we are the target user
 And so in the startup phase the founder is or was the target user right?
 So for you you're the target user for your product that should be your focus groups
 And then the second piece is like looking at your team and like who are the who are the pieces you need and
 I love this definition of the hipster who's the designer the hacker who's the engineer the hustler who's the
 Sales and marketing dude who's out there?
 Sound like crazy
 so
 Anyway, I thought that we'd be fun to share with you guys this year a lot of you guys are in start a mode and you're thinking through things
 Or maybe you're trying to grow and you're stuck and you're like, huh, and maybe it's like, oh, we're missing
 That's it. We're missing the hipster. We're missing the hacker. We're missing the hustler like finding those those people
 It's interesting as I see people in the startup phase one of the biggest
 Mistakes people make is that they're not going into it with all of the different
 Essential
 Personality types you need to run a business. I did an episode a while ago about just the disk test alone
 Make you look at this test
 It's like if you don't have someone on your team. It's a high D that's driving the thing
 It's gonna be really hard to get off the ground and if you're starting your found up found or you take the disk test and
 You don't have a high D
 No one does it's like my guess is that you guys are procrastinating for a long time you're six months a year two years three years into this
 You're not successful yet
 It's like because you don't have a driver you need you need that personality archetype to be able to
 Push this thing and get it off the ground, right? And so let's just know one of those lenses of just like okay
 And it's funny it makes me laugh because it's like exactly who we had initially when we were doing this the the hipster the the hacker and the
 hustler so
 Again look at that as you're building your team as you're looking at like why are we struggling at it's like which one of those pieces may you
 Potentially you're missing and then from there it grows out right and it's interesting like we're talking about this as well
 It's like if you look at that
 You know from his side from the the hacker right from the hacker now
 He was the one personally doing all those things initially right and then it's like I just are hiring a team
 It's like okay
 And then we need someone who just specializes in this one piece and specializes in this piece and this piece and this piece and this piece and it's like
 It takes you know a dozen people or you know to be able to do all the individual pieces
 That's how you get to the next phase of growth right think about with me initially
 I was literally writing copy designing the funnels design the graphics doing the emails like I was doing all the different pieces
 And um, I was doing them good, but then it's like now we find people who are great
 But they specialize in each one right so we got one person who's better copy
 Then one person's better graphics and one person's better funnels. I mean one person is better that you know
 That's kind of the second phase of it is
 I believe so anyway, I thought it was kind of cool and exciting as I was thinking through it
 So
 There you go guys if you're wondering it's the hipster the hacker and the hustler. Hope you enjoy that
 I'm gonna get to bed for real this time. Appreciate you all and I'll talk to you soon. Bye
