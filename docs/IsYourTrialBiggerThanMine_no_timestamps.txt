 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to the mark music is podcast today. I want to give you a perspective change
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet
 Still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everyone, so I'm outside my yard and I'm walking around and it's a little bit cold
 But I had a thought that I wanted to to share with you guys today
 And it's the thought about
 You know people all the time will talk about how they're blessed or how how lucky they are to to live here or to you know
 Or to live in this time of what are all the different things and
 I think it's good. I always think about that how blessed I am and I feel beyond blessed
 But I remember a couple years ago
 It was the first time I had a trip chance to go on a trip to Kenya and while I was in Kenya
 Man one of the most amazing experiences ever
 But while I was there of my wife and I we had chance to to go and build schools with these kids and remember walking
 the very first day we got there and
 We're sitting there in this little this little village and this car pulled up and all these people are swarming the car
 And in the car there in the back of it
 there was like a couple of these bags of
 I don't corn or some kind of food and and they dumped them out and the car drove off and all he was some swarming towards them
 They get in cups and they're grabbing you know there there
 They're their food out of it and they're fighting over and stuff and and we're walking towards this watch
 Instincting happen and then look over to Klet and she's just borrowing her face is just she's crying like crazy
 I'm like oh, you know one of those things are just like I wasn't expecting that you know and I start breaking
 I start getting emotional and it's really hard and and the whole week was was amazing to spend time with the kids and
 And see them these humble circumstances where you know if they're getting one mill a day
 They're lucky and it's not the kind of meals we you know
 and
 And I remember for the first part of the trip sitting there and thinking like man, why am I so blessed?
 Why am I so lucky? Why?
 Why was I born here in America and have all these luxuries and and food as much as I want and money and and
 Running water and toilets and you know and you know how blessed I am and then um
 Again and I am
 It was interesting as I this are watching throughout the rest of the week
 I started looking at these kids out there and I don't know why if I saw these these kids and they had a
 Tire a bike tire and a stick and they were playing for hours like hitting the the bike tires the stick and having fun and all these things and
 and and I remember looking at these kids and they had the biggest smiles on their faces and they're so happy and
 I look at that in perspective to sometimes I see my kids or other people's kids
 I know who were sitting playing video games on these Xboxes and play stations and all these expensive things and they're angry and they're sad and they're miserable and they're and
 I
 Started thinking about that perspective just like wait a minute
 And am I the one that's blessed or are these guys the one that's blessed?
 Here they are in the middle nowhere. They don't know about all those other things and look how happy they are
 There's not depression there. There's not suicide there. There's not all these things that plague everybody
 here often and I
 Says perspective change of like maybe maybe they're the one that's blessed
 Maybe I'm the one that's cursed
 Maybe I was cursed with blessings and riches richness all these things, you know
 I have different trials and temptations and problems because of it and
 It's one of those moments. You're just like, huh? I wonder if I'm seeing this whole thing wrong and I remember
 I remember hearing a quote from somebody. I don't I can't remember who said it. I wish I could find it again
 If not, I'll just quote it as my own
 They said you know when this life is over and we have a chance to be back with our maker that will be shocked
 At how similar in severity all of our trials were in life
 And start thinking you know a lot of times we forget that the person
 Who may seem like they have it all they've got the money that the house is the cars, you know, they may
 They have all the stuff figured out
 But they may be struggling in their marriage or their family or depression or you know things like that and somebody who's seemingly so poor and they have nothing
 Yet they're happy and they've got family and they've got
 that part of life figured out and I think I think all of us are gonna be shocked someday
 we do have a chance to to be back with our maker and we sit there and and you know, I think sometimes we think well that person got lucky this person got lucky and
 I think that we're gonna sit there and we're gonna we're gonna
 We're gonna listen in and we're gonna realize that all of our trials were the same different trials, but same severity we all had
 the same the same
 You know, I said and done that the rules were the same
 And we'll be shocked at how how fair this life actually was I know that's hard to hear especially
 For any of us who are going through trials we're going through problems and you look at everybody else like everyone else's life is perfect except for mine
 It's like I don't I don't think that's true. I don't believe with just loving God would give one person more trials or harder trials than
 Then somebody else. I think he gives us all the same
 Obviously the trials are different we each get our own bag of bag of problems bag of blessings, a bag of opportunities and everyone to call him
 But I definitely think that
 That when he was creating this this whole thing he
 He wasn't being unfair on just anybody and so I think it'll be interesting
 And so with that said
 We look deep inside yourself and look at the pain the ear personally going through right now
 Whatever it might be and then look at the people around you that you love and realize that
 Everyone's got the same the same severity the same
 The same trials I should say not same trials the same severity of trials
 Well, I'll be shocked when this life is over realize how similar in
 magnitude and
 Everyone's trials and problems really were so anyway. I hope that helps you to have more compassion and more love on the people around you
 and
 When you're serving or lies you're serving people who are struggling just like you and
 Whatever you need to help them get out of pain. Hopefully it'll help you get out of pain as well
