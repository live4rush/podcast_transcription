 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing
 secrets podcast. So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who
 didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets
 how do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and
 the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain profitable.
 That is the question in this podcast we'll give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson
 and welcome to marketing secrets.
 I'll write it right you guys so
 head in the office it's a rainy day which is nice it's melting all the snow
 which boys had a really calm winter this year last year we had snowpocalypse
 where if you were watching Instagram snapchat back then you saw how we like our
 kids had like 10 days off the school cuz the snow days we had like rain,
 Walmart for water and generators was insanely cool and then nothing really
 happened that was that bad but this year it's a spin. My winter forest so it's
 kind of nice anyway I want to share a couple cool things because these are
 cool things that are happening that I just can't not share. Alright so hopefully
 guys have heard me talk a lot about concepts like funnel stacking right where
 it's like what's your front end funnel where does that lead to the second funnel
 where does that go right and if you look at the big push that we've done over the
 last 60 days in our company is to really really focus on the defined value ladder
 and killing everything else that doesn't map to it right in fact we shut down to
 multi-million dollar programs because they did not fit in the value ladder
 which is kind of insane but nevertheless we did it because that is what we're
 doing is is pure focus on and focus and respect for the value ladder right so
 we'll come in there's this process and so you'll get the way that our value
 ladder is working now there's one big piece I'm revealing a funnel hacking live I
 can't reveal yet oh it's so cool though so it's the key that like loses
 holding together there's sends people through through the the process so cool
 it's so cool I'm in the whole presentation on funnel hacking lives you don't have
 your tickets yet go to funnel hacking live.com get your tickets for the greatest
 event on planet earth the greatest show on earth you can call me PT Barnum if
 you want this will literally be the greatest show on earth anyway but if you
 look at our value ladder very defined like front end offers that all lead then to
 one centralized middle offer which then all lead to one centralized back end
 offer and that's it and then my creativity gets to happen on a whole bunch
 of create a whole bunch of front end offers and so we were doing some data
 and some analytics and this is the coolest thing ever so one of the big
 things we're trying to figure out click funnels because of the middle it's like
 here's friend offers middle is click funnels and then top is like
 hiring coaching used to be in a circle for life until we filled that up so now
 we have a new program coming out soon it's gonna be kind of our back-end
 coaching program anyway so it was cool is we did a bunch of analytics we went
 through and we looked at all of our front end offers so the front offers
 thing we got probably half a dozen or so right now that are active and then based
 on that what was the retention rate of people in the second tier of the value
 ladder based on the the frame that they came into our into our value ladder
 through which was fascinating so fascinating so check this out if people
 with the first thing that they bought from us was the 108 split test book and
 then from there they they sent it into click funnels our churn rate on on
 people that that was a friend offer they came through is less than 3% insanely
 cool right now you shift if you go the dot-com secrets book so by the dot-com
 secrets book and then creates a click funnels account the churn rate is like
 5% so it's a little bit worse but still pretty good then if you go to like
 what are the other ones like expert seekers has higher the expert seekers is
 like 9% churn rate perfect webinar was like 7 or 8
 ah camera off on top of head if they just came to click phones home page and
 watched the viral video it's like almost 30% so because of this day you'll see
 some big updates happening to click phones home page but it's just interesting
 that like the frame that they enter your value ladder in dramatically affects the
 retention rate of them through the rest of the value ladder is that fascinating
 obviously there's there's there's it's not a perfect science right because
 somebody who's looking for split testing or who buys a split testing offer
 just by the default of what it is it's probably more likely to be further along
 in their in their career right like they're looking for split like it's not
 something like a brand new beginner typically look for words expert
 seekers is definitely brand new beginner or the gold digger viral videos like so
 so beginner so it's like it's not a perfect science obviously because different
 front ends will attract different segments of the market different people
 things like that but it's fascinating just to know that like what is the bait
 you're putting out what people does it grab and then how do those people actually
 stick long term it's fascinating fascinating fascinating so anyway it's
 made me think a lot more about like okay new front end offers what's the bait
 we're gonna create and then like and really choreographing I don't know if
 that's right we're but choreographing the offers to get your dream like the
 best possible customers to raise their hand and walk over to you anyway it's
 it's huge I don't have done a lot of podcasts on this in the past because it
 was such a big piffany for me through with five years ago I think about five
 years ago we're just like when we switched our bait is switched our
 customers which was everything else and so anyway just hopefully that helps you
 guys so I'm thinking through that simplification of your value ladder
 making sure you've got multiple front ends that lead to one middle tier which
 typically webinar or send least one high ticket which is typically a phone
 sale or something like that and if you're just starting your business start with
 the middle tier with the webinar and focus all your effort and your energy on
 that and to me at least a million dollars in sales about that time your webinar
 landing page and ads and things will start to see ad fatigue and that's when
 you start launching new front end offers you don't have to go this is a big
 misconception of value ladder that you have to have a front end and from there
 you have to go to a webinar and for me it has to set people up and it's not
 necessarily case in fact if you look at the selling mechanism at each rung of
 the value ladder it is its own value ladder in and of itself that makes sense
 okay the free-plus shipping I don't have to have a huge value ladder because it's
 like hey there's a really good product pay me seven bucks or whatever and I'll
 give it to you and so like because the because the barriers load of the the
 perceived values are going to be higher right on a webinar someone's spending
 90 minutes with me on a webinar that 90 minutes I'm taking them through a
 value ladder I'm giving them tons of value in that thing so because of that
 like I can go directly to a webinar and have success even if it's a cold
 prospect because I have that that 90 minute window to spend with them that's
 warming them up that's ascending them up through the value ladder right
 Sydney if I get on the phone with somebody I can on the phone build a lot of value
 in a shorter period of time so I can you can a lot of times it's harder to go
 directly to I take it sells but you definitely can do it we've done it
 it's a lot of other people do it so anyway that's what I want to kind of like
 I love Doc on Secrets Book my one thing that the people always get stuck on is
 that like they hear the constant value I like cool and they come back and
 care so here's my value ladder like and they have like 80 different rungs in
 this value ladder just like really complicating complex and then the
 track rate all before launch any of them I'm like no pick the one that's
 gonna be the best to begin with I still think a webinar funnel is the best for
 almost every business you can think of not every business but almost every
 business webinars the best because the the what you what you sell for it the
 profits are bigger so it's easier you can make more mistakes and so I've
 success because you're spending because the what you're selling is more expensive
 so it's more forgiving right and so like most was to start there and focus
 like just to that webinar to make them least a million dollars and then back
 downgrade to different front ends when it starts hitting fatigue and then what
 happens when it buys a front end and then you send them up through on thank you
 page of your front and offer you have what we call a thank you page webinars
 I haven't talked about this yet because we're testing right now our first
 one's actually going live today but I will definitely be talking about a fun
 hiking live so sends to the incubator webinar sends the next rung the value
 ladder and moves me through like that so anyway so much cool stuff I wish we could
 spend hours and days together and we will if I like you live so if you're there
 please come we'll hang out we'll be geeking out on stuff together hopefully
 gives you some insight on value ladder again it has been become our major
 focus last group of inner circle meetings and it will continue to be
 throughout this year simplification and mastery of the value ladder that is the
 goal alright guys love you all appreciate you thanks so much for everything and
 we'll talk to you guys all soon bye!
