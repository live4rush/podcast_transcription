 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the marketing secrets podcast today
 I am in the penthouse overlooking Boise getting prepared to finish the entire traffic secrets book
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answer my name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right my friends so yesterday as you know
 I was driving down here to the penthouse if you listen yesterday's podcast episode
 I got here and been working on editing the book together first the manuscript finished and now we're going back to the top and editing and
 Having some fun. We also spent like
 Seven or eight hours getting a shot set up to be the cover of the traffic secrets book here in the penthouse
 It looks so cool. Basically we pull all the couches
 Out of our room except this desk these monitors and we have a crane in here and lights and everything in tonight
 Between 8 28 40 is when the lights perfect you can see the everything setups way of photographers video guys
 Everything coming in where you're gonna be capturing these epic shots
 For the video or student for the trailer for the traffic secrets book launch, but not just the trailer also for the
 It'll be ads and it'll also be
 What's it called the the book cover? Yeah, sorry trying to get still image from this this shot to be the book cover
 So a lot of going into it, but we're excited it's gonna be really really fun
 So that's what's happening today other than I'm gonna be working on the book
 And it was interesting, you know as I'm working on the book and every hour so of editing at stop and they take a break to get my mind
 re-excited, you know and then come back and
 In between I went I started watching some you know just on Facebook swiping and Instagram is looking at stuff and
 Looking for ads as I do and I was looking for the ads. I saw this person and person someone who I consider friend
 I've known them for a long long long time online and
 It's interesting as I watch the videos and then I start clicking around looking at everything this person is doing and
 It's interesting to me because this person been around long enough. They've had success, but they're they're like
 I can tell by the moves they're making right now
 They're struggling a little bit that are hitting the ceiling and they're trying to reinvent themselves
 And so I'm watching watch this and I know because I've been through the cycle so many times in my own life like
 Anyway, so I'm keenly aware of it because I can I can sense it because like yeah
 You guys have heard my story. I've been up and went down up and down up and down way more times than anyone should in business
 And so I kind of I can sense where he's at in the spot right now
 And as I'm watching all the videos all the ads all the everything he's publishing right now
 He's using significance to sell so what that means significance is hey my name is so-and-so
 I'm so great. Look what I did look what I've been here look like to hear look like to hear look like to hear
 I'm amazing. I'm amazing by my crap. Like that's that's selling the significance talking about yourself making yourself feel more significant and
 I want to I want to step back real quick before I go to deep in this and and
 You always have to use some significance in your selling right if someone's gonna be buying something for me
 They've got it. They've got especially if it's like you're selling coaching or consulting or something
 It's like and they're trying to decide they should plug into you like there's always a little bit of that and for most of us
 When we first get started, that's all we really have is our own story right our own significance like this is what we do
 There's amazing. This is why you should trust me and hopefully I'll help you have success as well, right?
 And so I'm not downplaying a hundred percent because I understand that like a lot of us and me included like that's how you have to start
 You have to sell your own significance at first
 But this person's been the game for at least 15 years now that I that I know of and this person's had success for other people
 But they're still relying on their own significance to sell their their products and the services and they're all the things right and
 and
 I
 I guess I want to say that selling was significance through significance works
 But it only works to a certain level
 If you want to get to the next level the big secret is you can't keep selling through significance if you'll get my
 ads my emails my podcast my like the the voice the tone of the voice is coming from me and from ClickFunnels and
 And I'm gonna say this with you now that there's more people on the team
 It's not always me you know writing every email clicking send at everything and so there have been times when my copywriters or my teams
 The people that are working have have used more significance and I see those messages
 I'm always like cringing. I'm like I messaged and I'm like well
 This this isn't about me anymore. This movement's about our people
 This is about the people were serving this about their success like that's that's what I'm gonna be talking about
 So I try to nip those things in the butt something still slipkaters like I said
 You won't see me doing videos like I'm Russell look how big my company is this is why I'm so great
 You should blow up a ball, right? If you look at what I'm talking about I'm always talking about the success of my students
 Okay, I'm taking the significance off of me and putting the significance on them
 That's the secret. That's the key. That's the next level. That's how you go from where you are today to where you want to go
 Is stop talking about your set your yourself
 selling through significance
 It'll work and get you to a certain point
 But if you really want to expand and really really have a massive
 Impact and appeal and get to more people
 It's selling through the stories of your success stories like that's that's the big the big secret
 I was listening to somebody's podcast the other day
 and in the podcast they're interviewing Stu McLaren and Stu's been a good friend for forever and
 They're telling the story to come over for this podcast interview or something and and
 ahead of time Stu had like a piece of paper and was jot down names and the person's like oh you're writing you're at notes
 He's like no, no, no, no, I know it's I'm writing I write names of people's whose stories
 I want to tell people who are our students whose stories and
 The person interview was like that's interesting and they said later on this podcast is it was fascinating
 Every time I asked you a question he never ever said yeah
 well my first membership site blah blah blah blah and I got all these members and they love me and like every
 Sometime they'd ask a question and he would respond to the question with an answer from one of his success stories
 Yeah, you see the distinction there
 Guru a who I will leave a named would have and does if you watch all this person's stuff
 person's name
 If you watch that person does every single time it's look what I did look how big my business is look how much money
 I may look it look it look at look at look how great I am selling through significance
 Stu one of the hand sells through the success stories of his students
 Okay, a lot of s's in both of those selling through significance and selling through success stories of your students and selling through
 Success stories for students is the thing that will grow it's the thing that makes it so people don't feel dirty when they buy from you
 It's like you're filled like every time watch Guru a's videos
 Every time I'm like god this person like loves himself. God like
 Like I just I always feel this I was so dirty afterwards and it can't just be me right
 It's just it's it's the it's the market like the lowest here the markets can go
 Oh that person made billions
 I'm gonna go and and give them all my money because that you're like the lowest here the market
 That's what they respond to but the dream clients if people you want to serve will not respond to that
 Okay, they don't they won't they respond to success stories of your students
 Okay, so again, I put this that side by side on the left hand side Guru number a sells through his own
 significance or his or her I should say through their own significance and Guru be I'm gonna put Susan a Monica's
 Do's the man sells through the success stories of their students?
 Okay, one of them is cleaner. What of them feels better one of them will be more longevity from it from a risk standpoint like
 You're more compliant from the FTC from advertising guidelines of hearing success stories of your students
 Okay, like all these things are better when you shipped away from selling through significance and start selling through success stories of your students
 And so I want you guys to do from this podcast is look back at your
 Market like your advertising cute emails like your ads like your Facebook lives with your videos like you and share
 So go all the things and start asking myself like am I selling through significance?
 Am I just trying to show people a cool. I'm and hope they're gonna give me money is so
 Maybe that's the wrong the wrong the wrong motivation wrong direction instead
 What if I shifted back and took a step back and said look?
 I'm gonna I'm gonna figure out the success stories of my students
 Okay, and start compiling those stories as opposed to building up your own
 I quit telling my own stories a long time ago. Nobody wants to know like oh Russell Brunson
 Your his company makes whatever a day like you know, it's it's funny like when I was making
 You know a million dollars a year. I wanted to tell every in the world that I'd make a million dollars a year
 You know when we had we shifted to like a million dollars a day
 I stopped caring and people stopped caring and I stopped sharing it like it didn't matter anymore
 What matter instead was like oh here's this person look at the success they had look at this person success
 They had like that's when it becomes real that's what stands well
 That's when your movement grows when the movement is you bragging how good you are the movement will never grow
 When the movement is you sharing success stories of your students, that's what makes you want to be part of your movement
 That's why they connect that's why people come to fun like you live not cuz they want to see Russell
 Get his three comic club award. They couldn't care less about me
 They want to see their peers get their two comic club award and they want to visualize themselves getting it next year
 That's the secret. That's the magic. Okay, and so it's when you guys looking at your marketing your advertising your storytelling your videos
 You're everything through that lens. Okay, if you want to have impact if you want to
 Just a relevant for a very very long time you have to stop
 Selling through significance shift that away and start selling through the success stories of your students
