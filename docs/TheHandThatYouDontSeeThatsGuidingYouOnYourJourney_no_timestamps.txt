 What's up everybody, it's Russell Brunson and I got a really cool message I want to share with you guys tonight
 That at first may not seem like a marketing secret, but I
 Really think it's probably a secret behind all the gifts and talents we've been given
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody so hope first off that you're all having a great day and
 I just want to share a really neat experience
 And I'm gonna get slightly religious just for like five seconds
 But just to be able to illustrate a point behind why I believe you've been given the gifts that you have and
 My guess if you're here listening to my podcast
 That's not a fluke
 You've been blessed with something amazing and
 Because of that you've also been blessed with desire to share to help or to serve or to something right like it's just
 It's not something I understood for a long time, but something I see so clearly now
 a big believer that
 That God
 He calls us to do things and then he qualifies us by
 oftentimes taking us through a long horrible road
 For us to learn the skills we need to be able to accomplish the thing he wants us to do it's interesting so
 And you may or may not believe that but regardless it's it happens. You've seen it right you've seen where it's like
 I would accomplish the thing like I have no idea how I'm gonna do that and then he goes to this horrible painful
 Process oftentimes and then on the outs the backside of it you're able to accomplish that thing and it's like oh actually wasn't that bad?
 And it's because of this this journey this road we've gone on that is increased our capacity to be able to actually do the thing
 We need to do
 anyway, so last weekend we were in San Diego for
 for David Woodard son Chandler got married and it was a cool thing and so
 My wife and I had a chance to fly down there and be there for the wedding and the reception and just it was really really cool and in Sunday
 we're flying back home and
 Normally we you know try to go to church something, but we couldn't because it's just the way of timing was that but there's a really cool thing in San Diego
 that
 It's called the Mormon battalion
 Visitor Center something like that and
 so we had like an hour before flights we went from our hotel there and then went through the little tour of the thing and
 For those who don't know Mormon history doesn't really matter, but it was interesting is that
 after after people murdered the prophet the Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith they were leaving and they were trying to come
 Basically back west to find like somewhere to hide from these people who didn't like the Mormons right and so they get these hand cards
 and they're moving all the stuff and they're literally fleeing from
 From from the government and then all of a sudden one day all these these guys show up in these horses and like hey
 we need
 500 of your men to to join them this this army to fight with the country against the the Mexican armies and
 and
 You know first that I do you guys literally you killed our prophet you ran us out of the town
 you killed our people you've done these things and now you want us to join in your army and
 and
 Anyway, basically, I'm not gonna get too much in the whole story, but
 But they prayed about they felt like yes when you do this
 so 500 of these men left their wives and left their children and
 What in this long huge like year-long journey down down to Texas and across Arizona all the way to California
 part of this little army called the Mormon Battalion and
 They were promised by the prophet Brigham Young at the time that if they went on this journey that they wouldn't actually see war and
 Their families would be protected. So that's kind of this thing
 It's like going this huge journey and I promise you guys who are the religion the non religious people are listening saying
 Why is he talking about this? There's a purpose at a point and I think it's important. So
 Anyway, it takes these people and they go on this journey for all these
 For you know months and months and finally get all the California. They don't see any war they go in California
 They actually end up in San Diego and when they're San Diego
 It's interesting like
 They brought with them like they learned how to make bricks all the sorts of things
 They came to San Diego and taught the people to hear this and they actually helped settle San Diego initially and then from there
 their their year ended being up with the with the army said a chance to go back and get their families and
 Help them come across the plains and was interesting about it
 And this is I want to share this is that they went on this big long journey that they felt called by the Lord to go on
 They didn't you know, they're there to like hopefully
 You know to help in this war
 They didn't get in the war. They never fought they never did anything but they wanted this journey and through this journey
 Man, they got dehydrated. They didn't eat or drink for weeks at a time all sorts of things
 They met Indians they like did all something but on this journey. They learned a whole bunch of really cool things
 They learned how to farm in desert land. They learned how to
 And get how to make bricks. They learned how to how to find food and learn all these amazing things
 So then when they get back they get their families and they move to Salt Lake when you get salt lake like Salt Lake was like a horrible place
 right
 There's this big salty lake in the middle of this valley everything's dead and
 This is where the Mormons decided to settle right and they get there and these 500 men that gone on this big huge journey
 They get here and they're like well, we know how like we learned on this journey how to
 Go and like how to irrigate water. We learned how to make bricks
 We learned how to do all these things and all these skills that they had to have when they got to Utah to build a settle that place
 and to be able to build this amazing city that they did and
 As I'm watching this like I literally like tears in my in my eyes like as I'm as I'm realizing
 How symbolical this is to most of the missions that we go on right?
 Like for some reason always have some kind of calling right and it comes in different ways
 Some people some of you guys like you got into this business because you like the calling was like I need to make money for my family
 Right that was definitely initially what got me into this right and it's the equivalent of like hey
 You're gonna go to war to California. I leave your family and go this huge long journey
 So you go on this journey and I think if people would have told us ahead of time like hey if you do
 I'm on this journey here's gonna happen like you're gonna
 You're not gonna have water or you're gonna be going through like Arizona in the middle of summer
 You're not gonna have like I was horrible that they if we knew the journey ahead
 I'm gonna done right if you knew also if you have to go through to build your business
 You probably wouldn't have done initially right like you're like that. That's just too much. I can't do that
 Some of you guys, you know came in not because you wanted money. Maybe it was because you wanted impact or you had a message or
 You found a product that you loved or there's someone you believe in you want to support them or whatever
 We all come in for different reasons different things that bring us into this this journey
 And then we have to go through a journey that typically is not easy
 Like if I look back on the last 14 years of my life the journey to get to where we are today and get clickphones
 Where you're like it wasn't it was not all sunshine and roses
 It was tough. It was really really tough
 But what happens when you go through those tar times like it increases your capacity to handle things you learn little pieces every single
 thing along the way
 And I feel that that God is preparing you for whatever your real mission is
 And I don't even think click phones is my real mission to be honest like I think it's it's something
 It's like click phones prepare me for something different
 I think I have inklings of an idea of where
 My real mission is I could be completely wrong
 I don't know
 But all the ups and downs the trials errors I learned and it helped it helped me for a decade
 I like to increase in capacity so that when this amazing opportunity click phones came
 I've been able to handle it and know that I look at my partners people my team
 I look at the journeys they a lot of go through to build increase their capacity to be able to handle this thing because
 Man, I don't know about I think we've talked us a little bit on this podcast like it's it's not all sunshine
 And Rosa, it's it's a battle every single day. We're getting the crap kicked out of sometimes on things
 And it's like you get knocked down here get back up again
 But if that would happen five years ago, we couldn't handle it
 And so we went on this interesting journey where we got beat up over and over and over again increase our capacity
 So when we got to this battle to this war to this to this stage or on now
 We had the capacity to handle these things and it's so fascinating and
 Yeah, and it just makes me so grateful for that journey and for
 Those things like that. I think that's why I started crying and watching this thing with the Mormon battalion like like none of them
 Want to go on that journey the journey was horrible
 But because they went on that journey they come back to Salt Lake Valley and they they had been blessed with the gifts and the talents and the
 abilities they needed to be able to thrive in the desert next to a big huge salty nasty like right
 and I feel like all of us go on the same journey and
 I don't know about most you guys
 I'm sure the journey that you thought you were going on when you get back to where you're at now
 Like it wasn't the same journey, right?
 Like it's similar and but all these things you went along the way made it possible
 And again
 I feel like this this click funnel thing that we're doing now as much as I love it and I'm obsessed with it
 And I'm like so grateful for it
 But if hopefully ups and the downs and for everything like it's it's preparing me for something else is preparing people my team for something
 Like I don't know what that is yet. I don't think
 Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think God cares a ton about
 You know if my funnel converts or not which by the way the new funnel we launched last week is killing it
 But he doesn't care right?
 but
 But he's giving me and you and us the talents the skill sets the relationships the abilities the things we need
 So we can do what he really wants us to do so
 My recommendation for this podcast and my thoughts is just for you guys to think about like what is he really calling you to do?
 Maybe there's no God maybe maybe I'll just think that like all that like maybe there's not maybe this is all just coincidence
 I don't know but regardless this journey we go on
 It's it's preparing us for the next thing and I believe in a god
 And I believe that he's there guiding this stuff and so like I'm not afraid to talk about that. I believe it
 But when you do believe it is interesting because it's just like wow that there's this hand in this guiding me like what am I learning along the way?
 Like why why did I have this horrible?
 Trials horrible thing that happens like well a lot of times don't know right now
 But in hindsight look back later and like wow I could not have done that if it wasn't for that
 Like how fascinating that that thing that I hated became this you know such a good thing
 I'm ever telling Robbins event
 He asked everyone's like who here like surprised everyone's hands are raised. He's like bull crap
 He's like he's like you like surprises that are good. You know like surprises that are bad
 You know like all the issues like the bad things happen those are all surprises
 You don't like those surprises right like we like the surprises that are good, but the other surprises are there
 But I believe that they're there for our good
 They're taking us and preparing us and expanding our capacity so we can really do what our real mission is and most of us
 Probably don't know what our real mission is but that's something that's important to keep moving forward in
 Whatever the thing the path that you're you're on because as you do that like that vision of like what your true calling is will appear someday and
 But only if you're prepared for it. If you're not prepared for it's not gonna be there
 What a tragedy that moment finds him unprepared or unqualified for that moment which could have been his finest hour
 One of my favorite quotes
 So there you go. There's a little religion from from Russell. I'm gonna preach to you guys tonight. Hope you don't mind
 But I just think it's it's fascinating. It was a it meant a lot to me
 So I want to share with you guys as well
 And just think about that this journey we're going on like the ups and the downs of frustrations
 I don't give up because there's something there you're supposed to learn is something there so increase your capacity to prepare you for something
 That's coming and I don't know if that's coming in a month from now a week from now a year from now five years down ten years from
 I don't know when it is
 But I promise you these skills that these things you're learning along the way aren't just happen chance, right? Like there's no reason like
 Like I barely like I struggled in school right like how in the world?
 Was I blessed these abilities to write books and write copy and to speak like if you saw me ten years ago?
 I was the most awkward person ever like I couldn't look someone in the eye and talk to him, right?
 I want to mission for the Mormon Church and lock doors for two years door right over and I was so shy and awkward and nervous and like I
 hated it
 You know, I would have to speak in church on Sunday be so scared I always think like
 but like those skills like those things you learn like man like
 like there's so many ways that I'm using it today and
 Anyway, just fascinating such a cool thing looking backwards
 It's hard to seem forward and so I just wanted to pause tonight and look backwards from my own perspective
 because I'm now seeing the fruits those things in my life and
 Depending on where you are and all the guys are different spots, right? Some of you guys
 I probably wanted some really really tough times right now, and it's hard to look back and be like oh, this blessing is awesome
 But I promise you like
 It's not gonna last and there'll be a time we'll stop and look back and like wow so grateful for that thing
 I still think about like the most painful
 probably the most painful experience of my life was
 When we built up our recall centimeter hundred people and some of you guys heard me tell the story before but like when the whole thing collapsed
 And I let go 40 50 60 people overnight people that I love and cared about and thought were my friends and had walked out on me and like
 Like that was so
 Like so much pain and in that moment like man, I could have never looked at that and been like oh, this is awesome
 But was it's so fascinating out looking back on that and I am so
 so grateful for that
 course correction that
 That was forced upon me like if it wasn't for that
 I look at the direction we were going like who knows like it wouldn't have been good wouldn't have been this it wouldn't have been
 and
 That time when I was in the darkest like I still remember one morning
 Trying to leave the house and I was in so like so much mental anguish like I didn't want to go out the door and
 My wife came in to my room. She's like what's what's going on?
 And I could even talk and I just start crying and I remember she grabbed me and like
 Pulled me down to our knees and we sat there and and she prayed for me and prayed for us and prayed for this thing and
 Man looking back like that was such a scary scary moment and I know how I was gonna survive that
 From a business from a like there are so many things like how am I gonna survive?
 I don't know I have no idea
 they stood up she gave me kiss push out the door and back into battle and
 We had to figure it out and because of that again, that's what increased the capacity
 So when the trials and the issues that come today
 I'm more prepared for than I was then and there's still stuff happening like I talked about some podcasts other things have happened
 They've been like stretching me again
 But it's preparing for the next phase whatever that might be and I just hope that I'm worthy and prepared for that when it comes
 And I hope that you are as well because
 Our Heavenly Father he wants to use you in ways that you don't even know yet
 And if you prepare for that, you'll be amazed at what he's able to do with you. It's it's um
 It's unreal. So there you go preaching before I go to bed. Hope you guys don't mind
 Appreciate you guys listening in and
 And whether you believe in God or not it doesn't matter
 Just know that there is stuff leading your life
 and if you're in a dark spot or happy spot or ever have faith keep pushing forward and
 It'll it'll it'll all turn out right in the end and that's like up. So appreciate you guys have good night
 And I'll see you soon
