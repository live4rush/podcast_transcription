 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing seekers podcast
 Today I want to give you a little glimpse inside of my brain
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 Okay, so this could be like really cool or really scary depending on how you take it, but I'm gonna give you guys a glimpse inside of my brain
 and it's really
 Anyway, you guys will see those who listen to podcasts and the ones who like pay attention to the game I'm playing and
 You will know that this is like one of the keys that I'm talking about
 But I'm thinking about and we're executing on at a really high level over the next 12 months and so
 And there's so many pieces that go to this, right?
 If you have read
 Expert secrets, you know, one thing that talk about is when you create any kind of offer that there's different things right?
 There's an improvement offer which is like hey
 We're gonna help make you better stronger faster, and then there's the new opportunity
 Right, and this is one of the hardest things for people to really to grasp what else was to grasp
 I think people understand it conceptually
 The hard thing is like how do you turn the thing that you do into a new opportunity?
 And that's where I think a lot of people struggle and they try I've seen people who like try takes in the framers in the book
 and they go I made a new opportunity and they they they show it it's like well technically you kind of
 You know fit it into the framework, but it's but it's it's not a new opportunity, right?
 So how do you create a new opportunity?
 And is there businesses where there's no new opportunity where you're just stuck kind of with what you have
 You know
 For those who are subscribed to the Dan Kennedy no BS newsletter
 And if you know I should go to no BS letter calm and go subscribe
 It's insane month number one first issue this year January the first issue I took over control
 The whole concept we talked about in that newsletter
 Was the output the concept of opportunity marking how to create new opportunities, right?
 And so like my mind's been deep into it Dan has a whole course that
 He did back in the day about about selling opportunity
 He called the opportunity concepts course, which was good. We're rebuilding it redoing it and it's gonna be called selling opportunity
 Which is kind of fun, but anyway, I digress
 I'm sharing this because like for me for last you know honestly since
 Last year because I started you know preparing with the January newsletter and getting deep into this and asking Dan questions about it
 Like the more deeper the deeper I get into this the more
 The more I just keep I don't realize the understanding it's the key right?
 But how do you actually create that?
 I can create new opportunity and can you create an opportunity on anything and the answer is yes
 And so I have to be careful because I'm sharing some things here that I'm not raised here publicly, but I'm just excited
 So I'll share with you conceptually what we're gonna be doing click funnels, which will be a
 Parent to those who are watching from the outside, which is always the key right? What do you see from the outside?
 Click funnels
 Case studies are the ones that the easiest people to see but if you watch close to all the things I'm doing and all the businesses
 We're involved with you'll see this pattern replicated over and over and over again
 And so as I roll these out I'll share them more from here on the podcast, but what I can show easily is
 Inside a click funnel so one thing you will notice and you'll see over the next few months actually next month
 Hopefully is we are relaunching the click funnel certification program
 and
 I'm excited for it and it's interesting because I
 Think for most of you guys that
 This concept of certification is the new opportunity right you can teach anybody any
 Concept any principal any anything right they come in and they learned that principle but then for most from the new opportunity isn't so much the principal
 It's the it's the ability now to be in business teaching that principle right?
 So Dan Kennedy did his business like when he first got started he taught magnetic marketing to a whole bunch of people and their businesses
 If people came in and they started doing it and they grew their businesses and then Dan came afterwards and he didn't launch a certification program
 Unfortunately, maybe maybe we should hint hint
 But instead he he taught people information marketing said now that you you know
 You built your chiropractic business your dental practice or whatever using magnetic marketing principles
 You should teach other dentist that is other other chiropractors how to do this and that's how he
 Started replicating himself and started
 You started drawing from there, but that was a new opportunity right the opportunity was like make your dental practice bigger
 Like it was just a thing that he taught people how to do the opportunity was like hey
 You could actually come to dental guru and teach the stuff to the dentist right and that was the new opportunity
 That's what you know went from Dan doing well to doing insanely well right is
 Operative doing that we launched click funnels initially initially click funnels was a new opportunity
 But today, you know, there's a million knockoff funnel builders a lot of things there's things out there
 And so funnels isn't a new opportunity anymore
 But becoming certified funnel builder is right to be able to go out there and to sell these services other people
 and so I
 You know another good example is like isn't any grace and grace helps people overcome alcohol addiction
 and
 That is new opportunity for a lot of people especially people who have tried other things in the past
 Which is awesome, but then after me goes through a program. They've success and then they are you know
 Over they've overcome the alcohol issues
 Then the new opportunity now provides something like hey
 How would you like to be certified and you can you know thing to use went through experience?
 You can help other people with that as well and now she has a certification program extends her extends her
 Message gives the ability to create a legacy last longer than just herself and a bunch of other cool things right but it all comes down to
 This this concept is like creating new opportunity and the best new opportunity you can create inside of any business is
 the ability for
 For your customers to become you
 It's a certification. So it's like it's that that concept and so that's all I'm gonna share it yet right now
 Again, I want to go deep
 I want to like go crazy
 But I'm putting this in just so that those V2 are the ones you know
 And I know you are the ones who pay attention everything I say what I'm doing and then you like look to see the practical application
 You'll see this played out very very heavily over the next 12 months inside of all my businesses
 And so just wanted to put that out there as a hint as a breadcrumb trail
 So you can kind of watch what I'm doing and see what you're doing
 But for yourself start thinking about like man, how could I do that?
 Could my customers?
 Could I create some kind of program or certification or licensing or something where?
 The new opportunity isn't just that they had success with whatever framework you teach
 But they have the ability now to go and start a business or a life, you know a career
 Doing the same thing that you just help them with you know Brooke Castillo is one of the best examples with
 Her program right she teaches people her frameworks
 And then once a quarter I think she opens certification program. She's
 Killing it, but it's the same model. So anyway putting out there. There's breadcrumb start thinking about it
 I appreciate you guys all thanks for listening. Hope you enjoyed this episode and I know it's a little cryptic
 But hopefully get some I and gets your mind just thinking a little differently
 So new opportunities is the key to it all. It's like to get sent. Thanks everybody
