 What's up everybody good morning, this is Russell Brunson welcome to the marketing secrets podcast and I'm driving to the office and it is raining outside
 It's beautiful
 But today I want to talk to you about something that I think so many of us entrepreneurs forget about we are so excited about creating our product
 We are so excited about actually building out our funnel and then we've missed
 This step we not miss it, but we don't do enough to keep sales consistently coming in and that's what we want to talk to you about today
 So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our venture capital for spending money from our own
 pockets
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet
 Still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Alright consistency in sales, this is the key right everybody can launch a product and make a little bit of money
 Everything puts something out and get a sale every once in a while, but how do you make consistent sales all the time?
 I remember when I was first getting started in this game
 There was this internet marketing forum back in the day called the warrior forum and I was in there
 I was a member I was like reading all the internet and marketing guys is posting what they're talking about and some guy posted something about
 The camera was but he posted something
 About his sales and how many sales per day he was making and I remember I was just shocked
 I was like wait a minute you make consistent sales every day like I thought it was only a marketing game
 I was like you create something and everyone's bought some buys it and you get somebody to go play
 You know take your wife out on a date or something and never crossed my mind
 There's a way to make consistency in sales and I still remember I wonder if that post is still there from you know
 18 years ago, whatever it was but but but I remember posting I was like wait
 How do you get sales every single day like that never crossed my mind as the thing like that that was a possibility?
 Because I think I looked at you know
 My business as a promotion and I saw look at launches as the launch like you launch it and you make some money
 And then it you got to create a new thing to launch it and and remember that was the first time like it crossed my mind
 And he didn't answer nobody answered but I remember I was just like oh that you imagine that you like to have sales coming in every single day like
 That'd be insane
 And so that's like that's kind of the premise we're gonna talk about because so many of you guys have a promotion
 Or you've got you know something to sell there once a while, but it's not like a business that's consistently generating cash
 So you're consistently trying to grow right?
 And so yesterday actually last two days we hired a really cool company called chamber media and they are basically a contract
 We're doing a one big ad campaign per month with them for the next 12 months
 So that means is like I go in the studio
 They write a script they create a whole thing and and then we film it and we film the video and then while from the video
 We film anywhere from six to ten retargeting ads at the same time, right?
 And so the last two days we actually did two of them
 So and both of them like the first ones like admission and possible thing because we're using it to sell one funnel way challenge
 So I was heist hoisted. Hey said that word
 We I was in the air in a harness flying around like
 Like Tom Cruise permission impossible and we film all stuff. There's so much fun
 And then yesterday was another one is kind of like a first person shooter ad and like anyway
 So much fun, but we did all things and I remember at the end of it
 They've got their behind the scenes video guy there, you know
 Filming behind the scenes and asking questions of people and he asked me this question. He said you he's like why do you guys?
 Spend so much money
 Creating these funny ads like like I don't understand why you guys are doing this and you know
 the second ad was for expert secrets which is the book and
 earlier days someone said they're like made a comment of like like he's selling a book that's free plus shipping
 Well, how is he able to spend this much money on an ad?
 And so when the other guy asked that question on camera I was thinking from it
 I said you know what most people they spend so much time creating the product
 Right if we write in the book like expert secrets alone was like an 18 month project, right?
 So it's like a year and a half of your life is dedicated to creating this thing
 And then you go out and you create the funnel and for me
 That's like, you know, I geek out for a long time
 So it's 30 days of me geeking out deep diving
 Funnel hacking a million people writing the copy doing the videos like all the stuff
 Right, okay the funnel and then and then there's the next phase
 You know, so all different things to go into right and then we launch you make a whole bunch of book sales
 And then for most people that's where stops and for me
 It's like why do I keep investing time and energy money making new ads and driving new traffic and all these kind of things?
 And it's like if you think about because I love my product so much that I don't stop
 After we launched the product right like I want people to continue to read this book forever
 I want millions and millions of copies sold
 But when I'm dead that there are still ads being around my face on it selling my books
 In fact, I've told my team multiple times that if I die they have permission to continue to run my ads
 Every single day like that's my art. Don't turn it off. I remember Billy May's who's probably one of the greatest pitchmen of all time
 But when he passed away a couple years ago, they cut all his ads
 I think out of respect for him or for the family or something
 But even like oxy clean is number one best of all time
 They cut all his ox clean ads and put in someone else and and I just like do what ah like
 Ah, Billy May's as the as the greatest pitchman of all time
 Like the way he would want his memory to be like remembered is like people running ads of him
 He isn't careful. He's dead or not like that's his art
 He wants it to live on beyond himself and so if my team is listening to this and I'm I've deceased at this point
 And you're like should we run Russell's out? Yes, keep running the ad don't stop it. This is my legacy
 I want to continue you can
 Yeah, you can even add a meme video like from beyond the gray Russell's coming back to tell you about this book
 That's how important it is like I don't care keep running my ads
 But anyway, I digress and so that's the reason why I spend so much money
 Because I care about the product. I don't want it just to to be a promotion or one-off thing
 If something excels of once in a while I want some I want this thing to sell consistently every single day for the rest of my life
 Right, that's the big that's the big transformation in people's heads
 And so I think what happens in our world is we spend so much time creating the the product right so much
 I'm creating sales funnel so much time creating the initial campaign that launches and sells it and then we stop and we move on for the next thing and
 In my mind like what a tragedy like you spent so much of your blood sweat and tears creating this thing
 I told the guy in the camera
 I was like I was like my fingers literally were bleeding from writing this book
 Like I don't want it to go down and as just like a promotion like this is something that I
 Want to keep pushing keep driving and keep making sales and so the question comes back is what do we do next like after the thing is launched?
 What like where do we put our our creativity is it the next product the next thing the answers know you put your creativity
 Into creating more creative more ads more things to go grab people and hook them and bring them into your world
 Right if you read traffic secrets about hook story offer like you already have the story
 I know they offer now. It's going out. You got to create hook after hook after hook after hook after hook
 To grab more people and bring them in to hear your story
 Okay
 So the last part which never ends is the creation of hooks like you are creating hooks and hooks and hooks and hooks to keep grabbing people
 And bringing them into your world and that's where the creativity lies like I think us as entrepreneurs
 And I'm as guilty as anybody like my creativity is in the next book the next project the next funnel the next thing
 It's like no
 I need to shift more my creativity into the next creative the next ad the next video the next message the next
 Podcast next thing is gonna bring more people into my world
 and so in fact it's funny Stephen Larson he messaged me yesterday on voxer and
 It was a he's like dude in the last I can't remember two and a half years or three years since he he left click fun
 He's like we've launched like 90 funnels. He's like there's like three of them to make any money
 So we're like killing all the rest of them is like I'm start focusing my time on just creating more ads to sell those three
 They're actually making the money. I'm like, yes, that's that is exactly what I'm talking about
 And so if most of you guys like you have something amazing you've created something in the past
 It's sitting there on the shelf, you know or in your click funnels account that made money at once and stopped
 Or made a little bit but not what you wanted so you stopped the answer's not go make a new thing
 It's go create more ads go create more videos go talk more make more noise like get your message out there throw out more hooks and hooks and hooks
 So you find the right hook
 recent watching
 Dean grassy you'll see his video from fun lacking live he talked about his book millionaire success habits and they spent like a year and a half two years like
 driving traffic to that book and it would did okay never did awesome and
 He kept trying different ads trying different ads and it was like a year and a half almost two years in that he did this
 Ab that had a different message, right?
 It was just a shift on the positioning of how he positioned the thing and that was the one that hit and since that point
 They sold like 500,000 copies of the book or more, but it was just shifting the message
 But he didn't know what messaging was right
 It took him a year and a half of creating lots of hooks after hook after hook after hook after hook before he found the one
 That blew it up, right?
 And so sometimes we just stopped to early we try hook it doesn't work like oh, I'm out
 It's like no no no the product might not be wrong the the funnel might not be wrong
 Just your hooks were wrong like how many hooks have you thrown out today?
 Is it one is it two is it ten is it a hundred like go create more of them put more out there make more ads create more videos
 Make more images like all the stuff we're doing like all the things happening around the product down
 Around the funnel are as important about more so well
 They are definitely more so for your long-term like consistency in sales, right?
 It was really fun yesterday as we were creating these ads
 every single scene of the ad would create the ad and then we would stop and we could retarget me out right there, right?
 And so for one video we'd have 600 targeting at today. I'm coming in we're making a
 We have a landing page we're creating and so
 I'm trying to get this picture so we're coming here
 We're getting the picture like I would try I was trying like what's the give me the best hook for the picture
 So I wrote a red shirt and red watch and red shoes like because it's to be bright right and like the picture
 We have these colored big colored sticky notes always things go like I'm trying to create a hook
 Let's get a lot of people's attention, right and then
 Brand is coming over with this video camera and after we have the pictures landing page
 I'm gonna create like 30 different ads to get people to the landing page, right? So it's gonna be me like like
 Showing the nine-page document landing page and there's always like little micro ads will run on Facebook and YouTube and Instagram and everywhere all talking about
 The the picture that is the picture on the landing page to get somebody to opt in right?
 And so I'll probably create 30 different ads today all going to the landing page that we're developing today
 And that's it right and I'll probably have 30 ads and probably 20 retargeting ads
 So it's just like it's just like there's one piece of content right the the landing page then from that landing page
 We go back and create 30 ads 40 ads 50 ads all just push into landing page and they're all dumb
 They're little they're fun
 They're like and we have no idea which ones gonna work which ones aren't gonna work
 So we just make a whole bunch of them right and and that's the that's the secret. That's the that's the key to longevity. So
 Anyway, I hope that I hope that helps
 Especially if you guys who are who are frustrated sales are down you're right
 I get consistency you want to make this more of instead of a hobby more of a full-time job
 it's shifting your focus from the next product to the next ad and
 Putting in focusing your creativity there. So anyway, I hope that helps cool stuff happen
 And hope you guys are having great holidays and that said I'm gonna go inside and take some pictures and create some hooks
 And hopefully sell some more books. I appreciate you all and I'll talk to you soon
