 I'm pumped to be here with the guys today you know my name is Russell Brunson and we're
 talking today about something really really exciting we were coming up with the name for
 this I titled this this presentation you're about to hear that how can I afford this master
 class and the reason why I called it that's me guys have read the book Rich Dad Poor Dad
 if you don't read that book before who hasn't read it or who has read it I should ask it's
 probably a better question. In the book Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert Kiyosaki said something
 that was like so profound to me he said there's you know the difference between rich people
 and poor people so they they're same people right they have same brains same like everything
 different people are rich people are rich and people are poor so I am so excited I'm
 stuttering. He said is the way they look at things like the way they ask questions someone
 who's poor will look at somebody and say how can I or they'll say I can't afford that and
 someone who's rich mindset looks somebody says how can I afford that and it's like a little
 shift like oh I can't afford that to how can I afford that and it's this little shift and
 so many guys the messaging that's we're coming closer and closer to fun like live like 20
 days away or something saying oh I wish I could come much to come and like I wanted to
 like grab it where they say hey real quick what you need to understand is that there's
 a way to do it instead of saying I wish I could come I can't afford that say how can I afford
 that so we nicked in this how can I afford that masterclass and to be here today I wanted
 to invite you guys to a special I wanted to invite you or wanted to invite you a special
 event have a special guest who's been coming to speak to you guys tonight which I'm really

 chance to meet him and I didn't know the story I know the background news is there I talked
 him for a while Ketchup can and he hit it off I thought it was awesome a little while
 later I went a chance to work together he sat next to me for a couple years building funnels
 and then after he went on his own and I watched him build this huge empire this huge business
 and I didn't know then but I found out a little while later the story about how he got to
 Funnel Hacking Lab and I'm not going to ruin the surprise he's gonna have a chance to tell
 you that story but he could not afford tickets Funnel Hacking Lab but he knew he's like this
 is the room where it happens you see him you know that's saying like the room where it
 happens he's like this is the room where it happens I need to be in that room I gotta
 figure out a way to do there and so instead of saying what broke mind of people do like
 I can't afford that he said well how can I afford that how can I do to be able to afford
 out so I could be there so I wouldn't have to miss it so I could be part of it and I
 watched him do that he got there in the room and he'll tell you the story I would I want
 to tell it about messing up so he'll tell you the story but he got there in the room he
 learned out of those funnels he became one of the best funnels in our entire community

 business huge empire and I spent like such a huge honor watching him over the last few
 years he's spoken of Funnel Hacking Lab three or four times now he's gonna be speaking
 this year again with me on stage I'm excited for someone who I consider friend and someone

 first off I hope to see you guys there I really am like okay cool I hope you okay sounds good

 sounds good so seems like 50 50 awesome now I don't know if I don't know if I have ADHD
 or what I put headphones on when I'm talking a lot especially workshops though sound good
 here we go okay so you guys are in the right spot then I found myself in a situation where
 I couldn't afford any anything I was living on loans I was in college family was in the
 army I in order for me to learn any kind of funnel building I was I just made a contract
 with myself that I would be tired I was okay to be tired and I remember looking myself in
 the mirror and saying I am willing to be tired I'm gonna go learn funnel building and I remember
 one year in particular I'm sorry one month in particular I looked in in front of the
 mirror in our bathroom freezing little part where they were and I looked myself and I said
 I'm gonna be the best funnel builder in the world that was my goal am I I have no idea
 but the pursuit of it is what matters okay and so first off you need to have a goal you
 got to have the thing that's willing to go you know get you out of bed and go through
 all the craziness and I remember I sat there and I looked at looked at myself and I just
 got really serious with myself I realized that what I was doing in school is the dime
 a dozen and that if I didn't learn any tangible skills that on my own I wasn't probably gonna
 have the career in the life that I actually wanted and so he who here is a funnel builder
 I found my people yes you did Shelley absolutely maybe okay you guys are funnel builders awesome
 how many of you have a a a a a a a a a skill set already I'm gonna be here I came here to
 learn maybe maybe I do maybe okay good okay did you definitely can do this then alright
 what fun acting lives in a couple weeks here you guys got this not yet I'm a funnel builder
 yes yes yepers copyright ink here okay good now that was the first thing that I that I
 checked off with myself I started by reframing my brain because I was very broke and if you
 don't know military people don't get paid a lot and I was in school and we were living
 on loans basically we'd get I think it was six thousand dollars to live on for three months
 and or three and a half months and so that's what we're living on and so there's just no
 extra cash flow in life right so no it's a cash flow oh video is fixed very good very
 good yeah right and if you guys are like ah I'm broke that's different than saying I'm
 broken and I want to make sure that you understand a very key difference between those two here
 because I had to do some little games in my head I had to get some different mentalities
 and mindsets going to actually get this to work out alright okay so let me keep going here
 the first thing I want you to recognize is that in this life we see exactly what we look
 for if you're broke and it becomes a reason for you to not do anything it that will become
 true if you broke and you start seeing opportunities and ways for you to move forward and change
 your life that will also be true you will see exactly what you look for in this life exactly
 okay so with your permission I want to talk about myself a little bit here for the next
 little while to really just to explain kind of how I did this and I'm actually going to
 share how I did it rather quickly I'm only it's only going to be just a couple slides here
 I make slides because I'm very visual but what I'm going to do at the end of this is I'm
 going to go and give you guys five steps that I want you guys to write down that if you
 just do them and repeat them right the chances of you getting 2k payday the chances of you
 having success only shoots to the roof sound good awesome yeah how did you pitch your
 funnels with people fantastic question I'm actually going to give you the script yeah
 who's leaning in who wants this please get a piece of paper out stick with me lean into
 this and I dare you I dare you to go straight into the storm you guys know this is going
 to sound really stupid and it's actually going to say it's going to stop backwards first off
 let me tell you the answer is not a pig what do you look can I tell you what my favorite
 animal is it's not a pig but it should be alright here's my favorite animal did you guys know
 that the buffalo is the only animal that turns directly into a storm to shorten the time that
 it's in the storm every other animal flies away from the storm and actually keeps it in the storm
 longer buffalo are the only ones who turn straight into it and thus actually shorten the time in
 the storm I'm going to dare you to look at some honest truths about yourself and during this I'm
 actually going to dare you to challenge some beliefs you have and recognize the true nature
 that everything good and bad is your fault and I had to do that for myself and get brutally
 honest with myself and I remember looking at myself in the mirror and saying son Steven you're broke
 stop pretending that you just have a little bit of your broke and I had to get brutally honest and
 tell myself that and recognize that like okay let's be brutally honest where I am therefore I can
 actually navigate my next steps easier so let's move forward here okay I'm going to give you guys
 some more permission right so first of all I call it the legal crap section I have to do this because
 of lawyers and garbage now so hey everyone raise your hand or feed after me Steve you're not my
 financial advisor Steve you're not my financial advisor and this is not financial advice but this
 is not financial advice this is just some cool stuff we can think about just some cool stuff we
 think about cool everyone feel disclaimed sound good alrighty you like that awesome hey I'm going
 to give you guys three quick ways that I bootstrapped these are three very fast ways that I used to
 stand my business up off the ground one of them is how I got the phone hacking live but I'm actually
 going to share with you two others very quickly and these are all these are three ways that I was
 able to pay for the cost of what it takes to get something like click funnels or get something like
 you know different softwares to get start getting traffic hiring people and hiring help okay so
 here's three quick ways and I want you guys to write these down okay um uh Steve is gonna write me a
 check not no I'm not going to Timothy I'm gonna invite you to do that for for with someone else
 you're right uh okay right now this is um this is I was I was in my marketing degree and I started
 walking around between classes reading and I started doing that because I started recognizing
 that what I was learning in college was not actually what I wanted to learn in college and
 and anyone never knows that and so I started opening up um I started opening up uh books and I
 would read between classes while I was walking don't really recommend that did run into a few
 few things every once in a while and in this book right Robert Kiyosaki says that rich people have
 the mentality of how can I afford it and so I remember writing down sitting down in an empty
 classroom on campus and putting this problem in front of me and I wrote down on this whiteboard
 recording uh what resources do I have available to me how could I get the funnel hacking live
 and I actually asked this question um uh quite a while before figuring out the answer I made it
 too complicated and what I'm hoping is by me being here with you guys today I can shorten and
 collapse some time for you not saying that you won't have some other challenge or figure out
 something else in your life or whatever but um it took me a while to figure out how to do this
 because I didn't have anyone to model um and so you know except maybe Robert Kiyosaki and
 Risad Porta there's no one else in my life who was doing funnels is anyone else like that
 you're the only person you know who's doing this stuff right Russell bro yeah okay all these
 these I Russell Brunson was the only other person I knew in the entire universe that was doing
 this other thing called funnels there were family members of mine who thought I was doing kitchen
 funnels like selling kitchen funnels and I'm a terrible cook and so I didn't have anyone to
 relate to with this stuff and uh I would get in little fights with my college professors and
 such as well right your whole family's doing funnels that is awesome that's a blessing too
 that's awesome okay so I had no resources and I was like I gotta get resourceful and so this is
 actually a picture of the very gymnasium where I would see that arrow um the end of that arrow
 should have made it brighter sorry but at the end of that arrow right there there is a um a box seat
 and it was an open window and what I would do is I would jump through the front window and uh
 hide up there from security studying funnels it's where I've learned most of funnels stuff
 was in that room right there and I did that because of the fast internet I could say they're
 past building clothes and I would hide from security up there um and uh and that's this is
 that's where I started learning things about like the webinar and where I drew the first funnels
 that I was going to go build and learning how to create cash and cash flow and get traffic for
 the first time and it was in that room right there and so I was sitting there maybe feeling
 like how you might be feeling I had a skill set it was uh I was I was doing it with other um
 I was I was practicing the skill sets with these other small businesses but I hadn't had like a big
 success yet anybody you know you're learning the thing but you may not you haven't quite gotten
 like that story you haven't quite gotten the proof you know right it feels like I was like right
 on that cusp trying to figure that out and all the while you're playing these mental games going
 like am I just crazy right is this a real thing are these people just like blowing smoke on camera
 you know all those questions were run into my head all the time and I mean I mean I mean I
 I it's usually would occupy my mind during like army PT would be run and I'd be thinking like
 it's also a bunch of full of crap you know is this real um and I even remember one I remember one
 uh time we were doing some sprint uh some tracks some sprint tracks I'm saying that we were we were
 sprinting around a track and the phone chimed this is back when like periscope was the thing he has
 my periscope and I was picking up on his russell and he was like I got some cool thing for you today
 you know he's blasted on into his phone and I just remember so much wanting it to work and um and so
 I really leaned into the reality that I there's things I just don't know and there's no room for
 me to be prideful and act like I have all the answers uh this guy robbie kesaki says rich people
 ask house can I forward it and this guy rock you know Russell Brunson is saying funnels work
 and can change your life and I'm like please I hope one of those is you know at least make one of
 them true you know and so I was very much in that spot negative cash flow uh and I was coming up
 the end of college so I had to figure out what I was going to be doing with my life as well so
 here's kind of what happened um so here's here's three ways that I was able to kind of bootstrap
 my new business um and I wanted to share each of them with you very quickly I'm not going to hold
 stuff back to the end or whatever but at the end of this I am going to walk through five steps if
 you just keep doing them it's going to help you kick up leads who are open and and possibly willing
 to trade something like a plane ticket or a funnel or hotel night to get there and that's exactly
 what happened to me okay so first off here is how I actually got click funnels all right now uh
 back then I think about your 30-day trial now but back then when I got click funnels was two
 July 2015 was my first bill to click funnels July 2015 and I went to the 2016 funnel hiking lives
 okay so this is the year before and I was broke I didn't have any money I didn't I couldn't get
 something like clickfalls and uh stick with me because there's a huge point to this I couldn't get
 clickfalls and so uh that Robert Key Saki man that that line was just sticking in my head
 rich people ask how can I afford it rich people ask how can I afford it and also would have these
 other like motivational videos sticking in my head all the time how bad do you want it how
 bad do you want it how far are you willing to go you're going to do some weird stuff for some
 weird outcomes you know I would just keep these lines in my head and um uh and I remember
 looking at click funnels realizing I needed it and what I did is is this I so this is actually
 the that's the first funnel I ever built as the first funnel I ever built right there um I funnel
 and and this is how this I did it um first of all the week before I got the click funnels trial
 I was like what if we take the next week I'm going to do all the funnel hacking I'm going to do all
 the research I'm going to write all the copy write the scripts I've never I hadn't done anything
 like that in my life before ever this is the first funnel think about all the things you got
 to do for your first funnel right you don't know and so I remember writing into support to ask
 how to change the background color on the editor I didn't even know how to do that I mean I started
 from from absolute scratch right and so um now I'm telling you this for a for a for a lesson
 stick with me okay and um and it's in that little arrow that's why I put the little stadium right
 there um I was in that room I was in that room I was doing this stuff oh man I look back on this
 just such empathy and that's why I have so much passion when I speak to people who are trying to
 figure out how to make it because I'm like man I was there oh there's freaking sucked but you
 guys got this and just stick with it you know just lean into the discomfort this comfort doesn't
 mean it's a no um so this is what happened though I decided that I would take the full week and
 plan out the funnel out funnel hack I would write copy I would shoot the videos I would and I was
 I was literally renting um the I was going to the library on campus and I would check out one of the
 cameras because I didn't have a camera and and I would go to just this and I would always sneak
 into the classrooms when they were closed and I would set up the camera and I would film and I
 ended up filming my first course five times before I felt like it was good enough but I didn't have
 video editing software I couldn't afford it I was broke so what I did is I would go turn the camera
 back into the library and I would keep the SD card and I would go over to the library uh a computer
 lab because they had software right and I'd go plug it in there and I watched YouTube videos on
 how to edit video that's how I learned all adobe basically um was like that um and so I get it and
 again it's another reason why I get a little feisty when someone's like I can't afford it I'm like I
 don't care I don't care that's your goal like that the constraint in front of you is what's going to
 qualify you for the thing you're wanting in the first place okay you're not gonna no one's coming
 to save you and it was one of the things that I had to get honest with myself about no one's coming
 to save me and people will say Jesus is I was like he already did this one's on you okay no one's
 coming to save you financially this one's on me I'm not gonna get someone sending me some random DM
 going like oh here I'll let me drop a line down so that I can save you what right I had to be very
 honest about that so I'm just passing this gift of a hard mallet lesson onto you saying look no one's
 coming to save you which means you're gonna have to do things differently than you probably ever have
 and you're about to grow and I cannot wait for the first time epiphany you're about to have with it
 and I'm please come give me high five let's take a selfie or whatever when when you come to fun
 knocking live with this because I'm just I'm very excited for what you're about to go through so
 I leaned into the discomfort right and I came up with my own plan that's a big key piece of this I
 came up with my own plan and I said I need I know I need click funnels right week zero I'm gonna
 plan it out plan all these pieces out I'm renting the camera I'm writing the copy I'm funnel hacking
 I'm drawing it all out I would write all the plans out on the whiteboard all the email sequence all
 the follow stuff I didn't know what I was doing is the first time I've done any of it right so
 once I felt I had a good plan then I clicked go on the click funnels trial and I remember the first
 week all I did was focus on building the funnel this is still a lot of classes in the army all
 the stuff so I was doing most of this from like midnight to 2 a.m. and I was built the funnel and
 so I built we built the whole funnel the first week and then I focused on week two of the trial
 on selling and so by the time week three came around week three was actually I paid four click
 funnels with the customer's money sweet I'm gonna go ahead and give myself a amazing stanky
 pat on the back right there that's some good move good job Papa Larson right that makes sense so I'm
 I hope that you feel that that they're a good job oh thank you very much
 right but that's how we got click funnels right so a trial period that someone's giving you that's
 not a bad constraint that's a good constraint change your relationship with constraint
 that's what I had to do that's what I'm trying to get to right I want you right now to sit and
 whatever piece of paper you got in front of you or wherever write down the number one constraint
 you're running into don't don't make it this vomit don't try to what was the one write it down
 because what you're gonna what you're gonna practice is creative problem-solving and that's all I'm
 trying to help you see that that's all it takes for you to have a totally different outcome from
 life that you want creative problem-solving and while you can get insights from me from Russell
 from other people been there done that absolutely will help show you the map a map still doesn't show
 terrain so you're gonna execute this map but of course the steps are gonna look a little bit
 different right I'm gonna hey step one two three four five I'm just trying to pre-frame these steps
 right before I start they're in it they're in a few minutes here okay as you execute these like I'm
 showing you the map but maps are not terrain so if you're gonna experience it slightly different
 than even I did right and so just know that going on into it that all you're doing right now is flexing
 you're flexing creative problem-solving and you're doing it in a way where it that applies to the
 scenarios you have in your life trying to answer that one constraint and I'm gonna start by changing
 my relationship with constraint and go ooh this is this is good this is powerful a lot of people
 think that having no rules of freedom it's not it's chaos okay constraint is a good thing
 you actually get freedom from constraint you grow you learn you progress right think about a gun
 if there was no barrel and gunpowder goes off it's actually super anti-climatic the only reason a
 gun is powerful is because of a barrel right all right let's keep going so I hope you guys know how
 much tremendous love and empathy I have for you guys and the things that if you're trying to figure
 this out what you're going through and um because I felt super alone and that was like the biggest
 reason I knew I needed to go to funnel hacking live I just wanted to know that there were other
 people with like hearts and blood in their bodies that were doing this stuff and I was like I know
 if I just go to this thing my life will probably change right just being in the room just being in
 the environment my dad taught me that when he was trying to get a job out of college he's like I
 want I walk down the biggest tech people and said hey I will take out your trash I just need to be
 in the room right so let's keep going so that's how I got cluke funnels how I started getting more
 cash when I was still broke but like um uh well I wasn't broke but I also didn't have any money
 you know what I mean like it was not like I was uh I guess that's the definition of broken okay so
 this is how I did it though is I just became an affiliate and and I created all these pages with
 me when I had hair on the other side of my head I created all these pages with affiliate links
 and I created extra little bonuses and and I put out tons of these different funnels and I became a
 funnel spreader right and I did a lot of this stuff obviously that's right anyway I'm just
 trying to share with you examples that um uh trying to make more money in your life happen
 by using the route of building a new offer is powerful but it also can sometimes make the
 distance to success longer sometimes it's easier just to learn to sell if people stuff
 just be an affiliate right and and get your way that way and I did that a lot there's several
 times that I've fallen back on being an affiliate um when I was trying to figure out my next business
 moves or things like that doesn't make sense okay gg's paid ads are organic I used all organic
 did you already have web design and editing experience no I didn't uh that's the reason click
 funnels is cool it's just a drag and drop editor right so uh and I also want to call out though
 another question I'm hearing notice that I'm saying a piece and there's a knee jerk reaction
 coming from people's brains so please know this is a safe environment I'm not gonna yell at you
 but notice that immediately as soon as I say here's the route someone will say yeah but Steve
 okay Steve you say this is the route yeah but and that's exactly what I'm talking about
 that little inner voice that constantly looks for reasons what I'm talking about won't work
 is what you kind of have to backhand and say you're not serving me anymore false belief
 I did this just like last week within like this cool guided session thing that I was in okay
 what are the false what are the beliefs I have right now that are no longer serving me
 right and so that's what I'm trying to say is like there is an element this is totally a
 faith-based game and you're gonna gonna go out on a limb and you're gonna do things that are
 gonna feel impossible a little bit scary um but I challenge you to be aware of the inner self-talk
 that pops up when I give you these five steps the other reason I'm not giving them right now
 because I can call it out it's does that make sense so so I want you to have right now on your piece of
 paper what your goal is go to funnel hacking lives or whatever right I want to go to funnel hacking
 lives and then right underneath it I want you to write here's my number one constraint right the
 constraint that if it was no longer there you would come to funnel hacking lives or whatever
 that goal is for you all right here's my number one constraint is it money is it time is it uh you
 know support from your own community around you maybe maybe you really do feel alone and no one
 really is around you or whatever right what is that one thing and as you begin to look for possible
 ways to answer the problem you're gonna have a few dialogues in your head and one of them is
 going to be this creative genius that we're waking inside of you oh I'm a creative genius I'm gonna
 go solve this problem and then you're gonna have the PETA gallery right based on your experiences
 based on your memories based on past failures based on things that are trying to look out for
 you it's the crock brain trying to look out for you but really it's just keeping you from doing the
 thing right I had that I got to know those voices real nice oh yeah they're jerks so I want you guys
 to just call that out I'm trying to call this out in a place of safety but recognize that if
 you're asking well Steve clearly had web design experience ahead of time no no WordPress if you
 look at it it sucked right so so just just recognize that that if there's this piece of you that's
 going yeah but Steve can I can't because he's Steve but I can't because I'm not Steve
 immediately call that crap out for what it is crap it's garbage it's the inner crock brain going
 are we gonna be safe as we make these new steps this is new territory I've never done this before
 right and thank that part of you but they tell it to shut up okay all right so let me keep going
 here let me show them a slide certain we'll keep going all right so I was just an affiliate
 I was bootstrapping and one of the key pieces I'll tell you also while I was really doing this
 was I made sure to put my head down and not look at the clock because it was very easy to start
 comparing myself to other people especially when you start to see the highlight reel of other
 marketers lives where they're like I made a million dollars in four seconds or whatever right
 whatever thing they're out there claiming and you're like oh my gosh I'm worthless I you know
 I totally went through that anyone else right like oh my oh I'm a worthless piece of guy how
 come I can't figure this out they're figuring it out and you do that like I totally did that and
 that's what I'm trying to keep you from I know the amount of time it took for me to be successful
 was longer because that's stupid internal dialogue right so I'm broken because of it right yeah so
 remember this one I want you to write this down also it's it's you against you and it's you against
 yesterday that's it don't look at the clock don't look at anyone else celebrate the two
 common club award winners but don't you dare compare yourself to them you're on your own journey
 and most of you are living your future hook Russell Brunson wouldn't have put me up on the stage if I
 had the money to go to my first fellow hacking wife is it interesting what doors have opened in my
 life because I didn't have money that's what I'm trying to help you guys get your constraint is
 exactly the meaning you assign it if you lean into it I dare you to but it's probably going to be
 this thing that makes it's gonna make cause a flip and actually what's happening is you're saying
 I want this goal I want this goal I want this goal and you have a constraint coming along you're
 like I can't because of this I can't because of this I can't because of this but in reality you
 can because of it you just can't see it yet yeah yeah yeah you against you you can see
 yesterday I'm I'm blowing exactly right 100% you guys are living your future hook you look just like
 just like me up here right I fully expect to keep going I want you guys all in that FHL stage right
 all right so let's keep going so this is how I actually bootstrapped um this is how I this is
 really how I got too fun hacking live was I sat back and I recognized that I was broke I was
 honest about it I stopped hiding from that reality I recognized that there were patterns
 in my life they were no longer serving me I recognized that um and beliefs internal beliefs
 they're no longer serving me I also recognized that I was going to probably experience a small amount
 of discomfort as I made new moves I recognized that there was going to be internal voices in my head
 that were well meaning but ill-informed right and I was good at the tell them like look uh shut up
 I'm gonna go make a new me I need some new software to run up there otherwise I'm gonna get stuck from
 where I am right bread bowl no it's no red bowl I don't drink as much caffeine as I used to I
 drink a lot when I worked for Russell I didn't really drink caffeine to other words for Russell
 that's funny all right let's keep going though so here's how I did it though what I did is I'm
 gonna tell to you very fast and then we're gonna break it down up until that point and again here
 on the other side of the head ready to go here um uh that's the funnel though that I designed and
 drew for um this specific business what I'd run into was I started building funnels for other people
 uh while I was in college still and I was I was finding these little startups and the start it
 was easy for me to find startups to build funnels for and I was a pretty new funnel builder
 I mean I'll tell you why this is important a second but I was a pretty new funnel but like I really
 was not great at it um but I worked for it you know I was willing to suck and that was okay um
 and what I did was I was working with all these brand new businesses and what was happening
 was I would build a funnel and sure there were things that were not great with it you know I was
 new I was gonna make new mistakes I wasn't new who cares right but but their business was new so it
 didn't really matter low at the risk and as I was building funnels for these different businesses
 while in college um the companies I was building for were so new that it was very easy for them to
 point at the funnel as the reason their business wasn't working does that make sense I don't know
 if you guys are trying to build a funnel for other people right now but if you're trying to build a
 funnel for other people if the business you're trying to build for is too new of a business
 and you're trying to do it as a service it can be very easy for you to be the reason everything
 doesn't work and I'm I started looking at it I was like you don't have a company like your
 fulfillment sucks it's not but what are you talking about like you have no customer support what's
 what you know what I'm saying and so what what listen to me I'm this what I recognize I needed
 to do and what I want you to do and this was a key reason I was able to make it the fun I can
 live as I realized I needed to upgrade my customer the customer that I was trying to build funnels
 for and do services for and and I was open about the fact that I was also learning under their wing
 that I was new um the company it needed to be a little bit further down it needed to be a business
 could be a startup at least a year old and so what I did is I sat down and I started writing
 down what my criteria was for my dream customer I was like okay and this is what I did I said
 like my criteria that teased them most cards in my favor I want them to sell up and this is
 there's no right answer here there's my decision so I was like I want them to have a product that's
 at least a thousand dollars no more of these seven-dollar knickknacks that means I can go get them a couple
 extra sales every month and it's like significant you know if I sell a couple extra seven-dollar
 knickknacks it's not going to be significant they might think I'm not important on this you know
 I'm like all right so the products had to be a little more expensive than what I've been doing
 it's like second of all they've got to have a customer list I need to be able to talk to the
 people that have been buying from them right I was like third they need to be willing
 like they got to have some kind of internet asset something already built and so I wrote
 those down on a piece of paper I still remember kind of where I was on campuses when I was doing
 these because these are key moments for me and what I did is I started linking through LinkedIn
 for businesses that kind of match that and I started writing down all of the businesses that
 match that criteria and it looked like they were internet looked like they were a little bit young
 but not too young they had a you know product that was a little more expensive and what I did was I
 I just sent them this message said you don't know what funnels are I'll build one for you
 just pay for the software if it doesn't work I'm sorry if it works you can pay me but if it
 doesn't I'll walk and I shotgun blasted that message out to like and that was a little bit
 I shouldn't put quotes on it it was like this it was there was probably another paragraph on
 there but that's the nuts of bolts of what I said and that was my deal and I shotgun
 blast that out while I was on campus to like I don't know a hundred businesses and I got
 two people to respond and one of them in particular I was like oh I think I can go crush that one
 keep in mind at this time the only thing that was available information and education wise back then
 was the book.com secrets there was no one from away there was no explicit secrets there's no
 traffic secrets there's no to comic book coaching there was no there's none of that stuff and that's
 the other reason why like I really want you to understand how much easier it is to win now
 compared to what I had when I started which is about eight years ago it's crazy so anyway so I've
 shotgun blasted out all these businesses just emails linked in messages and I was like and
 I got one to respond back to me it's funny because like two years later another one responded to me
 and I didn't realize there was someone in Russell's inner circle and so they're like oh you're the
 one that got away Russell I heard you and so mess these these company responded back and they're
 like hey I'm totally up for that let's do it whatever that is I was like yeah just go pay for
 clickfunnels and I sent them my affiliate link why would I not right and so I'm logging into their
 clickfunnels account with my affiliate link so I'm getting a little extra you know a little
 extra cash there which is nice and I went and I did what we teach I talked to their customers
 I surveyed them I asked them what their experience is like what do you wish we were providing more
 as a business you know representing the company and I started reading the response I just sent
 out at this Google form survey and I got all these responses back and I was able to see from
 these responses that there was a strong theme in what the customer was wishing that company was
 providing and they weren't so what did I do baby what do you guys think I did I'll build a funnel
 I built a funnel and I dropped out a quick email sequence right and I was new I didn't really
 know what I was doing I was just kind of following the mad libs templates that everyone that passes
 around and I increased the sales of that company and it made my phone was collected like 50 grand
 in the first month and so I turned back around to them and I said hey remember how I said man
 I'm doing I'm doing this all for free I was making money through my affiliate link right
 that was it though and I went back to when I said hey you know how I said like if this works we can
 talk about me getting paid if it doesn't all walk I just want you to buy my ticket to funnel
 hacking live in my plane and hotel and the dude is like are you serious it's like yeah and that's
 how I got it so you only bought it and I still like really freaking poor right so uh funnel hacking
 live comes I get on the plane and I didn't I didn't barter enough nights in the hotel I didn't know
 that I misjudged the number of nights I needed and so I stayed up the whole last night in the lobby
 but I was such I I just want to back up think about what happened when this company said yes to me
 I had no choice but to learn click funnels I had a client and so I messaged click funnels support
 I don't know if they're gonna I messaged click funnels support twice a day for like six months
 I decided also to become known in this space that I would become of the best service I could to
 the community so for that six months I also spent about an hour every day pretending that I was
 click funnel support my love to say this yeah all right pretending I was click funnel support
 because when people were asking questions in the click funnels community the Facebook group
 I would just go look up the answer and show them the article didn't ask for anything did that for
 six months I was like I'm just gonna show show up and serve show up and serve show up and serve
 that's it so when I showed up to a funnel hacking live and I landed I didn't have enough money for
 a taxi so I rented one of those city bikes uh is in San Diego and I literally had my luggage
 over my shoulder and I rode a freaking bike through San Diego to funnel hacking live through the
 bike in a bush because I needed it to get back and uh uh to the hotel um and I walked in to go
 register for the event and the head of support was standing there and he goes all right what
 your name welcome fun can live excited happy what your name I was like my name is Steven Larson
 and he looks up and he goes here's that guy pulling off all that Star Wars ninja crap on our
 software right it's exactly what he said I'll never forget it you're that guy pulling off all
 that Star Wars ninja crap on our software and I was like oh I don't know what do you mean he goes
 you messaged our support a lot I was like yes I do because I have to learn it because I have a
 client that's all I got here that he goes I want you to work here and I ended up getting five job
 offers throughout the remainder of the event from click funnels different staff um and I just
 really want to lean into the reality that you know um there's a lot of reward that comes to somebody
 who doesn't look at the clock doesn't compare themselves other people of course I do who knows
 perfect at it okay but who really takes the time to get good at something without looking at an
 immediate reward I hustled my face off to get to funnel hacking lives and guess what happened as
 a result I get to work next to Russell Bronson and what's interesting also to note is that I
 wouldn't have worked for Russell Bronson if I had the money to get to funnel hacking live bringing
 that up again and so that's why I say when you have this constraint it's important for you to
 recognize that it's actually an accelerant for your future if you treat it like a proverbial weight
 room right you're going to the gym I'm practicing my creative problem solving skills I'm practicing
 my mental toughness skills you're telling me that a little two thousand dollar thing is going to
 keep me from my future I had all these little tiny self-talk chats with my head um to make sure that
 I was in this mode of problem solving of am I actually worth it well yeah I am okay then freaking
 prove it right prove it and so I did and I just I made a contract with myself to be tired for a
 little bit I was like that's going to be fine and I um I would work on my own funnels and projects for
 people as fast as I could every day usually from midnight to a.m. I just made it happen and sometimes
 there's nothing more to it than that and sometimes it can be a disservice to yourself to think it's
 more complicated than that I found a client I said I'll trade you funnels instead of payment
 for a flight to fun hacking live and the event ticket and then I read support docs I mean to be
 honest that's that's it that's what I did and so what I want to do is I want to walk through these
 steps to make it crazy simple so you guys can go do this as well because you don't have to do
 it exactly as I did and they feel like Steve I'm not trying to be a funnel builder that's fine
 swap out any skill you've got with funnel building and and and pursue it that way okay you're awesome
 Steve you're awesome I'm just excited to hear now thank you very much I know I'm talking about
 myself a bunch but um that's what Russell asked me to talk about so hopefully that's cool
 oh all right let's go into this next piece here if we go back to my slides now so that's kind of
 a bootstrap the business but it's also how I got to funnel hacking live by trading funnels and
 getting there like that in fact the the real way that I was was building funnels for companies was
 I would I would rent the camera from campus library and I didn't tell them I was traveling with it
 and what I said is I'll go film your event I'll film your event I'll bring my camera to the library
 camera I don't totally recommend this but this is what I was doing and I was recording someone's
 small little in-person small little hotel room event I record it and then I take a bus like six
 hours back to campus turn the camera and keep the card edit the video learn how to put it on a page
 and site click funnels and just oh that's all this is a solving the single next problem in front of
 you and where anxiety and overwhelm come from is when you try to consume and solve and learn how
 to solve every single step all at once right like I got to do everything in my future it pulled all
 it's got to be now it's like no no what's the next one step just do that single step and I would tell
 myself I need to do three things a day and I built my entire company like that and I back it and
 these times is actually where I started that three things a day three moves that's it Jim build
 the plane while flying yeah exactly right all righty let's do it all right so um so yeah my point is that
 you're first going to solve the problem of how to get to some hiking live by understanding that
 you got to switch to everything to its possible mentality um before it's actually getting it solved
 in real life right redefine your relationship with constraint and I promise you that if you start
 looking for ways what I'm telling you won't work you will find them and if you look for ways that
 this could work you also will find them it's exactly what you look for it's exactly what you make it
 make it nothing more than that just move I'm the least likely success story it took me 34 products
 tries to make one to work and half of those walls would be with Russell
 how bad do you want it okay just go right I'm clay baby bold me and I put myself into environments
 that I know are tough because environment grows me faster than my willpower ever could
 and right now you're being presented with a tough environment this environment is this gymnasium
 orchestrated specifically tailored to you even though there's other people who are trying to
 figure out how to get to fun hiking live yours is tailored specifically to you and asking you to grow
 very few adults are willing to put their own back against the wall burn the boats on their own accord
 and say I will figure it out okay I will figure it out just figure it out make nothing more of it
 than that keep it simple in your head next step at a time and that's just how I drove the train
 right all right let's do this okay so the other thing I would ask myself is I ask myself this a lot
 how would the person I'd like to be do the things I'm about to do that makes me shut off Netflix
 faster right or whatever how would the person I'd like to be do the things I'm about to do and
 I would keep that line in my head a lot also I did I did so more at the beginning I kept so many
 motivational YouTube videos on just replay during that period of my life too because I was living
 on faith man there was no evidence and there wasn't another soul around me for me to like have
 camaraderie with right there wasn't anyone else and so I get that and so your mentality that's why I'm
 spending a little bit of time on this I know but no 45 minutes already but the reason for that is
 because if your mindset is wrong you will fail anyway and I really wish mindset wasn't part of
 the answer I used to make fun of mindset even when I was working next to Russell right over there
 I would I remember looking at him one day I was so afraid that I was gonna get found out as a
 fraud my first two months working next to Russell then I didn't really say anything and I remember
 when I finally started saying stuff like by month three he was coaching someone and yeah he's we
 sat like this far from each other like almost shoulder to shoulder back to back in the office
 office before this one and he's he's coaching someone on some mindset stuff and I was still
 the mindset that that success is just a formula I was like just give me the one plus one equal
 success formula like stop telling me the mindset has anything to do with it anyone else ever you
 don't have to raise your hand but anyone else ever run into that okay and I that's totally a
 false belief by the way and I leaned back from when he was coaching and he leans back and he
 leans back in his chair and he was like shows you how far I've come also by the way this is
 while I was working for him this is after FHL right and he leans back in his chair and he's done with
 with his coaching thing and he sits back and he's like man that was a good session I was like
 that's good with my mindset stuff and I you know kind of took my headphones off and I was chatting
 and I was like yeah cool I was like I gotta tell you that man like I'm really tired of this mindset
 crap like just give me the formula it's like mindset what does that even mean it's so fluffy
 and he didn't say a word he looked at me with just like this well son lives about smack you
 upside the head and it did right I'll tell you mindset matters and it is easily 51% of the formula
 okay so let's keep going into this all right let's do this all right there we go I want you to make
 an internal commitment as we dive into these next five steps here to just commit to the unseen costs
 that are going to be required for your growth it's one of the exercises I do mentally to
 you know a lot of times before we take on any endeavor we want to see like beginning to end
 all right all right Steve I see step one I need to see everything all the way through step 99 to
 make it work whenever it doesn't work that way entrepreneurship as a whole is this idea
 right you see like you see the first you see the next three steps in front of you
 right and then and then you see nothing and it's totally right there's nothing there and then you
 see the peak I see the goal I see where I am I see maybe the next few moves and then nothing
 even when I have a map still to get to see every rock and bush and crevasse and river I'm gonna
 have to cross and bridge and I'm not gonna be able to see up ahead that there's a storm I'm
 gonna encounter that the person who made this map didn't have to encounter therefore is this a good
 map right we start freaking out about it and a lot of people will not make any moves because they're
 like what should I do on step 87 and I'm like are you on step 86 people say no and I'm like and
 why do you even care about it besides that you got 85 steps worth of experience that's getting
 influenced what you'll do on step 87 how on earth can you even judge what steps you'll be making
 that far in the future right it's just this idea that you're going to go know everything ahead of
 something you're not just make moves you can't steer parked car get a drive to move that right
 can't steer parked car get a move it's the only way to do it so just get moving just move
 just do something do you know that most people are so stuck in analysis paralysis they don't
 not gonna do a thing anyway so actually competition is actually a lot less than he perceives just
 doing something already puts you in the top echelon echelon i'm not saying that word correctly
 of entrepreneurs just doing something doing something doing anything makes you more likely to succeed
 than you probably perceive i gotta be perfect my offer is gotta be like Steve Larson's was i got
 at what's the exact copy that he emailed out to get those clients stop stop okay so commit to the
 unseen costs of the journey commit to the unseen costs that you'll find out about after you've left
 step one man they're gonna be there whatever right whatever um
 okay here's here's something else uh last last little piece here then we'll go into these five steps
 yeah i forgot about this okay so you want to find someone a model though obviously it obviously
 shortcuts a lot of the uh the guesswork but your journey is going to be different than anybody else's
 so you can't compare it on the pair to me they'll go back to Russell book where to anyone else to
 see the fun lacking life stage your journey is your own and you are just as powerful as anyone
 you're going to see on stage um i tell my little girls they're the little star seeds you know three
 little daughters the little star seeds they're like your job is to pass me how cool the thought
 same thing that's true with you guys your job's to pass me pass me do it i'm a high five
 y'all in the way i got water for you as you round the corner okay um so one of the things that i did
 this is actually russell did with me the first day i worked for him and i thought
 i'd be valuable to share this story and then we'll get into the real meet here i'm sorry that i keep
 saying that i just i sometimes i forget what's up coming up next so um uh so i sat down next to
 russell pronson right oh my gosh i was so scared sets just huge imposter syndrome and i sat down next
 to him and i was already a pretty good funmability of that by that point obviously and um and i did
 some design work in high school and and so i understood some layouts and you know things like that but
 i i wasn't like i'm not a designer you can clearly tell and russell hired an actual designer and we
 started building follows together um uh you can tell when a designer you know came into the came into
 the scene but at the beginning it was just russell and i there was no copywriter there's no
 videographer there was no email person there was no uh there was a paid traffic person um there
 they're just russell and i so literally thank you youtube and google i would videotape russell with a
 phone right this is how we would build follows even back then i videotape them sometimes you
 guys ever see when i pulled like three phones we got all these different angles then what i do is
 i would take the footage and i would put it into adobe and i would look up how to do a transition
 in adobe um i just was i'm just relentless right it's just a trade of mindless relentless i'll
 figure it out no pressure it i'll figure it out to keep going like make the moods and so i would
 fill it and then i would edit the video and i put it up on on the uh i put it up on the funnel and
 then i would write the first stab of the copy and russell will look at it be like great job right
 it made me start totally all over again uh just right 80 percent of it right um and um the first
 thing you ever had me go do though was clone pixel for pixel this funnel so this funnel was uh it's
 not up anymore but it was the original funnel university funnel and look at it's long i had to
 take two huge screenshots just to stitch it together um what i used for video editing doesn't
 really matter doesn't really matter i don't want to get caught up on a tool um i just edited videos
 and so uh that's a long page and so day one of my training with russell what he had me do is i'd
 sit next to him um but i mean i always did but he said what i want you to do is i want you to
 remake by hand this entire page so i opened up a brand new page in coxlennel's editor
 totally blank and i had to remake this entire page and it's a big page and i spent the whole
 day remaking it and said what i'm gonna do is at the end of the day i'm going to look at mine and
 i'm gonna look at yours don't tell me which one it is i'm gonna try to guess okay this is how he like
 started doing the finer point training up and um so i spent the whole day rebuilding this funnel
 and at the end of the day i handed it back to him and he looked for while he's like leans in and
 he's scrolling through the funnel and he's like looking at both versions which one is his which
 one is mine right he's like really you're mad like that's that's pretty intimidating he was super
 intimidating for me and i was like okay okay that's just super nervous you know and he goes
 this one's fine and he was right and he had figured out some little weird piece of code i didn't know
 how to do um and um uh the point is is i learned that day that i needed to remain extremely trainable
 extremely trainable that i had gotten to a certain spot but man i knew nothing still right and that's
 a key attribute to anyone who's going to be in a hyper growth state that you're going to go after
 and i expect to see all of you funneling live and he's like Steve but it's only in a few weeks
 constraints a gift how would you do it right Pavlov's law something takes the amount of time
 that you allot to it so here you go how are you gonna do it i i always kept in my mind that i would
 submit myself like clay to the environment and it would mold me which was uncomfortable a lot
 but it was very fast you know only 35 like i'm um uh just remaining very pliable
 calling out my own false beliefs right spot checking my own internal dialogue that wasn't
 serving me anymore that's a big key piece to this okay all right let's keep going here so my goals
 i'm going to share with you guys these next five steps here and this is how i kind of earned my
 weight funnel hacking live 2016 okay um did you guys see on the registration face for this
 we're also asked this thing says if you don't go the only logic reason is as Russell says you must
 take money um and i started making sure for the space on it when i worked for him which in hindsight
 is a little creepy um but anytime he says you must hate money i'm like oh i don't like anyone else
 could kind of offend about that i get so offended anytime you would say that we must hate money i'm
 like she couldn't tell me i hate money i'll throw this mouse on the wall it's not my problem and my
 guess is you don't hate money either we just need some more steps to make this first 2k payday right
 that's in the email too okay okay um so here is the five steps um to create a quick 2k for FHL or
 have someone else help pay your way okay so i would use this if you're trying to get a quick cash boost
 or if instead of getting paid with money you're going to get paid with a ticket make sense so however
 you choose the medium of exchange to be here all right let's do it so step number one i want you to
 write these down it's the similar steps that i even walked through a lot of you guys with the original
 one funnel way challenge how many guys did that anyone funnel layers from like the og days a long
 time ago when i was when i was super hypey and kind of hurt your eardrums just a little bit more
 you were mean i was a little bit mean i'd like to formally apologize all right um
 ish all right here we go okay sweet okay here we go so step one what i want you to do is i want
 you to write down what problem could you solve or learn to solve for a successful business
 and recognize already the question that it's uh bringing in some constraint please do not try to
 solve a problem for a business that does not exist yet you're gonna have an easier time having
 fastest success for your own wallet or whatever you're trying to get um when you upgrade your
 customer upgrading your customer is the answer to 90% of marketing problems upgrade the customer
 you solve so much so first off what you're going to do is you're going to ask what problem could
 you solve and i want to walk through a little bit of a um workshop style ask with you right with
 you right now okay um and so uh let me kind of dive through the questions that i want you to to
 answer as we go through so i'm going to i'm going to lay out each of the steps and in each of the
 steps i get a little extra explaining i want to do with each one of them okay so again step one
 remember i'm saying what could you solve what problem because i didn't ask what skill do you have
 some of you may feel like you don't have a skill yet we're going to start by thinking about the
 customer not you right you don't feel your own wallet so at some point your opinion doesn't matter
 right so let's think about the customer what problem does the customer have that you could
 solve or consider yourself learning solving it's the first question to write down now i really
 learned a lot of this from my dad my dad's awesome love my dad uh it's my own event there he's uh
 hanging out at and he came to one of my events and i remember it reminded me of a time though back
 in um at high school he said to me um he's been very successful in his career and he was like
 Steven if you want to i was i think i was i think i was in high school he said i asked i started asking
 him more about his career and i was like you know how did you make these moves why are you in
 which you're learning why are you in what you're doing and he said if you want to make more money
 you need to be where the money is i was like okay it's like that sounds obvious but it's not
 if you want to make more money and have more security only go learn the business roles that are
 related to generating cash for a business those aren't the roles that get the axe during tough times
 they send it to me kind of like almost off the cuff i was like that's an interesting move
 it's like if you want to go really far in your career learn the business skill sets that are
 right next to the money anything that revolves in bringing new cash right or renewing cash but
 really bringing new money into a business go learn those skill sets you get does that make sense
 think about all the things it takes to run a business think about all the roles you could go
 apply for a job for now filter them by the ones that bring new revenue into a business learn those
 those are the best skill sets that we typically take you the furthest i was like that's some gold
 pop-a-larsen that's some good stuff hand for pop-a-larsen all right good stuff so i was like okay cool now
 what i want to do is i want you to think about what the core roles and any of course systems all
 businesses have now there's a lot of different um what is my t-shirt say in the last one says i
 got 99 problems but my pitch ain't one that's one of my favorite shirts i got a lot of edgy shirts
 anyway so what i want you to recognize is there is a um
 there's all businesses have the same problems that they have to solve right
 now 80 percent of companies are the exact same you got to get leads you got to get sales you got
 to fulfill you got to re-sell and there's dispute out in the world on whether or not it's three core
 systems or steps or functions or if it's like eight okay so i will let down to like these like four
 five right every single business every single business needs leads right the two things all
 businesses need or they die is consistent lead flow and cash flow all companies need those two
 things right lead flow and cash flow um and so you think about the lifeline of a customer and
 inside of really any business whether it's a product or a service online or offline bathcraft
 doesn't really matter i'm talking about what all companies must solve got to solve the problem
 how are you gonna get leads how are you gonna sell some of them how do you fulfill and deliver
 really well right to the people who bought the thing and then how do you sell them again
 whether that means to resell the same thing or upsell or downsell it's easier to resell
 existing customers than to get new ones right once they're in there and he's delivered so when
 you think about this i want you to remember we're asking the question what problem will i help
 solve for an existing business what problems out there that i could either go learn to solve or can
 or do not have solved for an existing business are you helping companies right are you helping
 companies get more leads are you helping companies get more sales are you helping companies fulfill
 more are you helping companies resell or upsell or retain now what i'm trying to do is help you
 give language on what you can say in an email or a post or social media or whatever as you try to go
 barter in exchange for tickets or two thousand dollars or whatever price point you choose
 okay i don't really if someone starts talking to me about like
 like bring everything back to the money right bring everything back to my special
 we talked to a business owner of an existing business bring it right back to the cash
 right back to how it affects the bottom line so thinking about what popa larsen the same here
 right that we want to learn to solve the things that are related to cash i'm going to urge you
 that the problem that you choose to go help an existing business solve is probably
 on those first two probably something to do with numbers one and number two leads sales right
 the purpose of marketing is lead gen so all you should measure marketing by anyway
 don't really measure marketing by likes subscribe shares comments that's just metrics not marketing
 right the point of marketing is to kick up leads and then you go pitch them and then sell right
 and so those those two pieces right there um uh i would encourage you like if someone came to me
 and said hey steve i'll help you fulfill all i want is a ticket i'm like okay that's cool
 it's not to say that it's bad but i'm just trying to the things that are like hot on a business
 owners mind all the time right and so they're out of certain phases very much like how do i get
 more leads how to get more sales and that's that's very much the tone that i took with the business
 that i pitched as well need a prospect first well first you should actually define the problem you
 want to solve we will talk about how to get that in a second to all the steps here right um
 and on that note actually um they didn't still get on club house i know club people still do
 but it was really big and then pulled way back for a little while and i guess it's not really
 researched very much um uh i was getting interviewed on this clubhouse probably like three years ago
 and um there's a big room that i was in and and the guy is it's time for like open mic q and a
 and uh i was in as his guest speaker and this guy gets on and he asks me this question he goes
 he goes steve i've been trying this entrepreneurial game for a while
 which probably a lot of you guys have as well my guess is i seriously doubt this is round one
 attempt for you right um and that's fine that's great took me long took me several tries right
 and there's there's a lot of honor in that to be honest um and so this guy says i've been doing this
 for a while i've been studying for a long time i've been working really really hard
 when am i good enough to make money that was this question what's wrong with this question
 what's wrong with that question it's a natural question asked but it's actually the wrong question
 altogether when am i good enough to start making money because i kind of fell into that trap myself
 and it's one of the reasons i'm bringing it up for you guys as well what do people buy what do they
 pay for right i love this right he presumes he's not good enough there's self pity going on when
 you believe in yourself confidence not feeling good enough for right enough uh it's about him
 not the customer oh yeah getting close there to linda like that right his focus is on the
 customer's needs you're not you're good enough already but the honest truth is maybe you're not
 i had to be honest with myself on some of these skill sets i was learning and look at myself in the
 mirror and go man i still suck at this right and there's a lot of this that's good so what's
 interesting is when you start asking the question this is a common question i got like one phone away
 also which is why i'm bringing it up because you're probably you know trying to do that and i
 when am i good enough to start making money the issue i have with this question it's very natural
 one i asked it for a long time and then i had to repent and change the error of my ways here
 you are not paid to be an expert that's not what people buy
 offers are about solving a problem not being an expert
 who let's dig into this this means you're closer to success than you probably realized
 uh probably like i don't know five years ago i came home from work here and um our ceiling was
 like three feet lower that's not normal um one of the pipes had burst and it flooded our ceiling
 full of water and it bowed way way down sucks anyone ever been terrible like way way way down
 and uh and then it broke right and and water's coming down i was like that sucks and pipe up
 burst and frozen and what i you know then he had to go through the garbage of calling an insurance
 company and all that stuff um and uh big headache and pain or whatever and we got it fixed but i'll
 tell you when the plumber showed up at my house knocked on the door and i opened the door what i
 did not say to him was are you number one in the world i didn't say that what i said to him was
 can you fix my problem i have problem i need to fix right makes sense very natural for brandy
 entrepreneurs to assume that making money has to do with being the best in the world that that
 it's similar to school i got to get a see in entrepreneurship before i can start making money
 that's not how it works at all it's the reason that we are starting number one with what problem
 do you want to be solving for your future dream customer what problem not what's your skill
 not do i need to be this amazing do i have to be this tall to ride this ride right we start looking
 for these qualifiers to disqualify ourselves as a way to not move forward okay so i'm taking
 that away from you and i'm helping you realize that's not the first question to ask you actually
 don't have to be the best you actually don't have to be good at all but entrepreneurs are good just
 by pulling someone together who is good with someone who has a need and they don't know how to do it at
 all and they just aggregate problem with solution and they step back okay they give it like that
 and so what we want to do is be very specific on the problem that you are trying to solve for your
 future dream customer that's actually the true first place to start not i know i actually
 being like you have a skill set the real first question is what problem valuable problem right
 could i solve or learn to solve for a business if i can do that i'm off to the races if i can do
 that i'm off to the races because now i'm building an offer and a solution around a customer rather
 than me that was definitely one of the reasons i failed for so many years because i kept building
 things for myself what would i buy i'm not the one buying it so i shouldn't be asking me
 that's a dumb question to start with shot myself on the foot for a year long that one okay so
 it's it's offers are about problem solving right not being an expert meaning yourself you don't
 have to be someone else already is you could just put people together all right all right here's
 number two the second thing is that now you are thinking about the problem to solve get a design
 your dream customer who is this customer that you want to work for right right um and anyone else
 drive themselves crazy with this quote i forgot why i put a picture of me graduating base there
 there was a story i was going to pull out but i i think it's just because this is what i was
 asking throughout all basics keep myself occupied or should i sell what should i sell what should i
 sell any of those other drive themselves nuts with that question drove me nuts it becomes like
 this whip right and i was like oh bad everyone else can figure it out but i can't the guy on stage
 seemed to figure it out i feel like i'm better at him than the skillful set than he is why did he
 figure it out i can't right anyone else and he like wicks still am right that totally get it and
 i've been there and it was a totally like this thing i would use to grind my own self and psyche
 to powder and i was like oh man they can figure it out what can what should i sell what should i
 sell then i kept coming at it from this idea that i needed to be a creative genius rather than again
 solving a valuable problem right it's not what should i sell it's who should i sell and it wasn't
 until i learned the difference in that question really on try like number of 30 something that
 everything changed for me because again i'm not selling myself my opinion really doesn't matter
 doesn't really matter avatars change around 57 times same right yeah it's not what do i sell
 it's who should i sell that has
 this problem you're looking for a match between a dream customer and the problem they're experiencing
 you're going to someone in the middle of pain that's awesome that's one of the reasons it was
 so easy for me to find someone to do this with and pay my way to have fun hiking life what should i
 sell no no no who should i sell who should i sell is way easier way easier okay and here's how i
 want you to think about this i'm going to walk you guys through something i call a core problem
 planner i do this in my own stuff and by the way Russell is gracious enough to
 he actually gave me an affiliate link if you guys are liking the stuff go to fhlbonus.com
 and you get to get a get a get a logo on events and come to mind about launching stuff after that
 for free all righty it's down at the bottom left there now the the core problem planner now here's
 i want you to think about creating a product or a service or an answer to a problem really that's
 all entrepreneurship is is we're solving a valuable problem for a specific person okay so i want you
 to think about your dream customer they're over here on the left right and they're they're
 read they're consuming material in the marketplace they're listening to podcasts they're watching
 these you know consuming posts on social media and they've got this goal already like oh man if only
 i could reach my goal i'm trying to get to the spot right i guess the arrows are that way okay
 i'm trying to get to that spot like what you want to do is as you think about the problems your dream
 customer is experiencing not all of their problems are worth solving that's one of the big key pieces
 i want you to understand as well just as a principal in life not all problems are worth solving
 so i think it's true business not all problems are worth solving i want to solve a valuable problem
 for my dream customer and so here's how i envision it i think about my dream customer as already in
 root to a goal like cool what's the dream customer what's their goal they're already walking towards
 what now that's where i want to think about problems the problems that they're experiencing
 while trying to get to their goal those are valuable problems those are valuable problems
 and and those are the types of problems where they're like you got my attention this is what
 you're going to come do for me i'm trying to get there you can help me get to that spot that's way
 easier way easier um then uh uh trying to solve anything right um oh that's a problem doesn't
 mean you should solve it we want to categorize problems to the ones that are tied to leads and
 sales that are also the ones that are encountering Paul in root to a goal you guys follow me i don't
 drop him like a ton of stuff we good people ask him for replays if there's going to be one available
 i'm sure there is i'm in the ClickFunnels studio here uh sure that they'll email it out this is
 some good crap though right i mean come on out all right let me keep dropping sweet let me keep going
 here so what i do and this is my own stuff i call it the core problem planner and it's a way to
 filter problems um not everything is worth solving right so what i do is i think to myself
 self what are the problems that they are experiencing on the way to a goal let me just
 let me just rifle out the things that they're probably running into and so in that first column
 and i want you guys to write this down okay in this first column i just write down
 the problems my dream customer they're likely experiencing
 ooh you know what they probably need more leads because they're running into this my guess is that
 they're wondering how to use AI they're also probably wondering if social media has the same
 reach they probably get it or whatever right and i'm just unwriting problems and i just
 jump as many as i can problem problem problem problem problem then i go to the next column
 and i just really briefly think about how i can solve it i'm not committing to anything
 this is just on a whiteboard on my own right or on a piece of paper i'm like well okay if that's
 the problem on the very next column i could solve it like this i could solve it like this i could
 solve that one like this ooh that's an easy way to solve it that's a fast way to solve it
 and then the next thing that i do is i want to look at the money that's that gray column there
 right where this cost price and value and cost is what it's going to take for me to provide us that
 that solution price is what i could probably charge for that out in the marketplace and value is
 value just means useful this value doesn't mean money how useful something is right it's this
 this uh drink right here is very useful to making me not be thirsty right or whatever
 and so uh what i do is i kind of fill this out and i use this as just a brainstorming tool to figure
 out what problems are actually worth solving in my dream customer's life what are those and i kind
 of did this when i was thinking through how i would get a ticket to funnel hacking life
 as i would think through okay what are the problems my dream customer is probably experiencing oh my
 gosh they're gonna want to funnel how can i solve that ooh by getting click funnels but the cost to
 me doing that you know what i don't think it's actually that much because i'm gonna have them pay
 for it just can be no cost to me what price would i charge i'm gonna tell them nothing blow their
 mind let's talk about after the fact if it works let's talk about me getting paid but i'm actually
 gonna pull the rug out for a second time and have them just get my funnel hacking life ticket and
 playing okay you guys get that that's where you want to harvest problems from not all problems
 again are worth solving and you want to choose the problem in your dream customer's life that they
 are feeling right meaning it's a problem they're aware of that they're willing to pay for and you're
 gonna come out and say don't even pay me just give me to funnel hacking lives that's interesting that's
 new that's different just right there that's probably a hook that they'd be interested in the first place
 okay i want you to recognize that your income flows in direct proportions of the types of problems
 you solve you want to make more money solve better problems does a grocery store bagger
 right you pay for the groceries and they're putting groceries in the bag are they solving a problem
 yes with respect to all grocery store baggers thank you for your service however is it a
 valuable problem not really so how much do they get paid not that much you want to get paid more
 solve better problems right and so i started recognizing that that was a huge reality in my
 life with this so all right let's go into step number three so right so step number one what
 problem do you want to solve for customers step number two who's your customer
 step number three now what we need to do is we're going to go out and we're going to start kicking
 up some leads right you guys start pitching people that's the metric to track here everybody if you're
 trying to figure out if steve teach me a way to measure if i'm actually progressing with the strategy
 you got one kpi right now it's pitch falling how many people are you asking to
 buy your funnel hacking live ticket and plane and hotel in exchange for whatever problem you're
 solving that's the only metric to add to to to really track right here is pitch volume only kpi
 okay so let's get some leads now i wrote these out i want you to screenshot this um and this is a
 bit of a mad libs style way to start kicking up leads all right um if you don't know the difference
 between inbound and outbound legion um really all outbound is is you going directly to a person
 and pitching them and inbound is they see something on the internet and they reach out to you all
 right so we just do both i'd pressure the name of different think of it this way inbound that's
 what you're going to put on social media on the left that's what you're going to email out to
 specific people okay left is email right of social media okay so what i want you to do is
 um and this is what i did i did this in campus library okay i did this in the campus library and
 what i did is i said i'm gonna start like i said i'm gonna go through linkedin looking for who
 matches my criteria and so i did i found the businesses again that had a product that was a
 little more than a thousand dollars and my my next criteria was that i would find a business
 you already had a customer list that i could email out to and then my third criteria was that
 they were already on the internet somehow i didn't want to teach them the importance of tech right
 that was my three criteria's and i started coming through linkedin and i sent them the
 equivalent of this message slash dm on the bottom left um so i'm gonna read right here
 uh and and put it in your own words but this is basically what my pitch was okay hey i'm sure as
 a business you've run into problem it's the problem that you chose during step one of those
 i know you don't know me but i'd like to offer you solution for your business until you get
 xyz results i'm not asking for normal payment for this i'd like to just go to an event happening
 at the end of the month if you'd be willing to pay uh that sorry it's supposed to pay me pay me by buying
 my ticket in travel um i'll be sure to return and give you x results um i'm sorry they my grandma
 got a little jacked up on there i'll make sure to get x result for you before i leave and also i'll
 do xyz for you after i come back from the event that's it i said how can you sell if they have a
 customer list i didn't all right i had to kick up a conversation with them i also could tell
 based on the linkedin profile if they were truly a business or not right you can just tell use
 your own judgment you'll figure it out and so i just went and just basically blasted this to a
 hundred different businesses and i actually didn't do anything on social media i didn't do what was
 on the right you guys are actually probably going to get the results a lot faster by doing the thing
 on the right as well okay so on the right i also at the same time would put this on every single
 social media platform you have access to i would say um right so so uh post post on all social
 media that you have access to and think about what the internet is it's just free distribution you
 can reach tons of people really really easily right so uh just basically that hey i'm looking
 for businesses who are running into problem the u-tubes i'm looking for one business who'd like
 solution and wants xyz result i'm not going to ask for normal payment i just like to go to an event
 happening at the end of the month if you're willing to pay by buying my ticket to travel i'm um i'll
 make sure to get results before i leave and also xyz after i come back making a deal for
 right now there's a lot of people who have heard my story on how i got there the first time and
 there's actually people i don't think i saw this if you guys go to the click from on facebook page
 right now you'll see that there are people doing this strategy right now there's people who are
 saying would someone sponsor me to the funnel hacking live event and i'll do xyz in turn
 people are doing that right now and it's so cool to see the comments yep totally got
 right yep hundred percent get it oh pulling off the steve strategy hundred percent
 so i don't want you to think you're disqualified you can also just ask people in the community
 could someone pay for my funnel hacking live and exchange i'll do xyz and have to think about it
 two thousand dollars is a pretty cheap funnel so if you're going to go build a funnel for someone
 and then i have to pay two thousand dollars for it first off make sure that you do a
 bang up job you you rocket you over deliver super hardcore right make it a story um just
 get the successful and crush for them but then when you come back from funnel hacking live
 gaining all these insights honestly i would just go back to them and say hey i learned to
 xyz one two and three now let's talk about me getting paid and if you haven't noticed i hope
 you get sales or whatever um whatever the result has been so far uh i'm going to install the
 lynch pin for you or whatever right funny enough when i did this strategy for myself it turned
 into a job opportunity and then that what i was going to do before going to work for Russell
 was i was going to go be a cmo for the business that i traded funnels for
 uh because it worked and so it actually opened up to job opportunities where i could continue
 to learn funnel building and internet marketing skills under someone else's business which is
 awesome right how cool is that i just want to know how to get the t-shirt it's sweet
 actually if you look at the link on the bottom left i'm pretty sure that's part of it okay all right
 so never have a screenshot of this because i want you to see how simple it is to do this um the
 market will treat you exactly as you train it so if you need more leads ask the leads if you need
 more answers for whatever you're doing put it out there and you'll start to attract and pull things
 into your life and opportunities into your life nothing will happen if you don't do anything
 which is something i know duh but honestly i want you to over complicate it just just literally
 do exactly the steps i'm telling you step one more problem do you want to solve
 that you can see yourself solving it's a valuable problem that's tied to leads and sales step number
 two to find more about who your dream customer would be for this type of solution who do you
 actually want to work with so you don't want to work with ecom then don't message ecom people my
 point is that you can choose that stuff you design the business that you're working in right number
 three kick up some leads all right um i forgot this is in here um
 that's nice of you guys uh very cool um so i forgot this is in here i'm gonna go really fast
 through this um i screenshot at this list of business types and industries from the click
 funnel's homepage like four years ago and what i want to do is i want to walk through what you
 this is total stereotypes okay i'm talking absolute blanket statements right now but this is what you
 tend to see in terms of product or business margin um per industry right if you're an agency or or
 a freelancer right usually around 30 percent in what your take home would be if you're an info
 products there's not a lot of cost in providing an info product like if you're an e-commerce
 there's a lot of cost in ecom right you got to pay to build the thing then you got to pay to box it
 then you got to pay to put shipping label on it then someone puts an auto truck then it goes on
 another truck then it goes back to the mail person then it gets scanned again then it goes to your
 door it's a lot of cost with ecom right usually some smaller margins with it um coaching and
 consulting usually higher margins more input on your side but more margins uh network marketing
 and affiliate marketing usually is quite quite small um sass or software um takes a lot to get
 up once you got it up you know 35 percent margins ish um and again total blanket statements here right
 uh lead gen i don't know that's all across the board blogging affiliate 100 percent but you got
 out a lot of a lot of people to be able to pull it off my point in sharing with this with you guys
 by the way is to show you that most likely the shortest distance to your success in getting to
 funnel hacking live is not lying in you going and building one of these it's most likely in services
 you're going to go learn most likely you're going to go learn uh a skill set and pair it with
 someone who's having that problem in a successful business and do a trade do a little barter for
 okay um okay yay cool so you guys with me you guys with me we got two more steps and then i think i'm
 out of slides at that point we got two more steps one problem you want to solve do you even want
 to solve that problem don't choose a problem you don't want to solve but just why i have you guys
 brainstorm that number two booty want to work us number three right you're going to kick in a
 bleed mad lib style hey this is what i'm putting out there is the offer i just asked get you don't
 get anything you don't ask for and so ask i even said that to Russell and asking if i could put my
 feeling in the bottom left of this and i was like hey i know this might be weird but i also will
 understand the prince you totally feel free to say no but uh if i'm going to come do this thing
 don't give us you don't ask for what if i click my link in the bottom left right
 until you ask the answers always know oh i love that wall so that's awesome hundred percent right
 all right now what you've done is you kicked up some leads so what do you do next you fall open
 clothes um and i really want you to understand that there is two different mentalities that you
 need to have in order really be successful in the internet um there's others but there's two core
 ones that unless you have these two core ones you're probably not going to go anywhere right what
 does it mean to be an entrepreneur now i'm not saying some ethereal answer let's start
 pontificating on whatever okay but what is an entrepreneur an entrepreneur is somebody who
 finds and solves a valuable problem that's it it's also the broke person's world there's a lot of
 entrepreneurs with dusty offers sitting on shelves who never learned the second part you don't make
 monies an entrepreneur that's not the that's not the expectation of entrepreneur entrepreneur means
 that you are solving problems using existing materials you're you're finding and solving a
 valuable problem that's all the word meets okay number two is on a marketer now marketer is the
 money-making goal in my opinion it is the reason i have never missed the funnel hacking life i get
 the top of the line strategies what's crushing in every industry the marketing and attention
 getting uh and lead gen strategies that are like dominating across everything organic and paid
 how do i not go it's literally better than my entire five-year marketing degree in fact
 but i finally got to funnel hacking live uh speech too i stepped out i called my dad and i was like
 dad i just learned more about marketing in the first two speeches than my entire five years in school
 so uh there's no other place where you get better education so that's why i always go as well so
 marketer is the money-making role it is the role that makes noise in order to get attention and
 kicking up leads right all you're doing in marketing is measuring and getting lead gen that's all
 a lot of ways to do it not really about a platform just facebook work yeah if there's people on it
 and if you're a marketer right um and so uh uh the reason i'm bringing this up is because where you
 are in these five steps is you've kicked up leads and take off the entrepreneur hat we need to be
 a marketer we need to put on the sales role follow up close them right that might be a little bit
 uh and i feel like a little bit of a new territory for some of you and that's fine we need to do it
 okay i'm slowly knowing the arrows are animating in the wrong way for me but whatever um so i want
 to i want you to the reason i'm saying this is that you remember that you are the funnel you don't
 need to go build a funnel for this you are the funnel all right what is a funnel a funnel is
 nothing more than automated offer a message when i was a daughter or sales guy i was the funnel i had
 a message and an offer don't complicate it beyond that the fact that we put it on the internet and
 click funnels is a method very powerful one and you should all do it okay but don't misplace thinking
 like oh stevesan i got to go build a funnel to do the strategy no you do not you don't need to go
 find people to do this with by building a funnel that only lengthens the distance to success okay
 you are the funnel you're the two kpei day funnel all right so i want you to focus on the role of
 marketing once you know this the problem you're going to solve right and you know the customer
 that you want spend your time in step three chicken up leads following up chicken up leads
 following up there is someone out there who's going to say yeah most likely right so follow
 part market hard meaning lead gen really hard all right and i want you to realize what a sales
 funnel truly is as well a sales funnel is not a marketing funnel it'll call the marketing funnel
 for a reason there's a huge difference between sales and marketing all right marketing is lead gen
 really marketing is everything you're doing three page one of the funnel right it's it's
 everything before page one of the funnel the noise you're making paid organic yes doesn't really matter
 it's anything you're doing before page one of the sales funnel how do you measure sales closing
 that's the role of the sales funnel and my point above that again is just to help you see and get
 the mentality in mind that the money making skill set for you is to be able to drive attention
 can you get that mad lib style pitch in front of as many people as possible and follow up with all
 the leads individually one by one saying can i will you this work for you should we do it now
 i'm going to do it now i want to go to find a king live let's do it come on now follow up is where
 you i'll see most of you guys at fhl wait a follow up is where i'll see you at fhl
 not in taking forever to come up with the perfect offer just just get out there and start pitching
 that's what i did okay now step five what i would do is bring the notes back from fhl certainly over
 deliver always over deliver make sure it's an incredible experience your reputation and story
 sticks with you forever plus just the right thing to do and over deliver this person is page your
 way to funneling live and then what i would do is i would circle back around and close the loop
 and say hey look i did this thing for you how cool is it uh by the way i went and learned a ton
 what if we what if we do another deal can i tell you right now the computer that i'm on i
 traded funnels for i built a funnel i traded for a computer and i just keep upgrading the guts
 of this computer how funny is that i've gotten so much stuff in my life with the skill set of
 vulnerability i bar all the time it's so fun why not right i've been seriously there's so many
 things in my life because i built the funnel not even for sale just traded it right so just
 lead into the skill set understand where it's going to bring you and the fact that it's going to open
 a ton of doors for you i didn't finish writing out the slide here but i wanted you to notice this
 is my sister marie she's awesome i'm the oldest of six kids um the youngest is 17 years younger than
 me she's awesome too my parents are barely in tns there's just kind of funny um and my sister
 wanted to go to funnel hacking knife i think it was 2018 so i'd already left uh college i had
 been working for russell and then i've left working with him and um she's called me and she was like
 steven i want to go to funnel hacking live i want to go to funnel hacking live but uh i can either
 pay my bills and buy food or buy a funnel hacking live ticket what should i do what advice would you
 give her what advice would you give my sister i can either pay my bills and buy food or go to
 funnel hacking live buy the ticket listen to your brothers right interesting i said i want you to
 understand the gift of the environment that life has just handed you remember our environments grow
 us bigger than our willpower this is no different for her and you are in one right now so i said
 i can't tell you what to do and i'm not going to tell you what to do but i just want you to consider
 that you have two options here and let's both play them out option number one you pay your bills
 and buy food what are the chances that life has handed you an environment where you will figure
 how to get to fhl you might i said what do you think is going to happen if we play out the other
 scenario here what's anything to happen if you buy your funnel hacking live ticket and you no
 longer have money for food or bills what are the chances that you starve and die in a gutter
 so i asked her that she goes i think i'd figure it out because i'm not going to die
 let myself die and i was like yeah i'm talking about that level of put your back against the wall
 guess what she did she bought a funnel hacking live ticket and over the next like month or two
 she built an agency and she got like five or six people each paying one to two thousand
 dollars a month while she was in college which is more money than i was ever making in college
 a lot of money is a college student and she built this little agency around content
 help people put their podcast out now she's left with the experience and an asset
 that's my point okay whatever is being asked of you whatever that thing that can
 shrink in front of you you know if it's tugging at your heartstrings i can't tell you but you know
 you know right we all know you wouldn't be on here otherwise okay you just wouldn't what is that
 experience pulling at you going hey you know you should go do this thing and then you're like
 but i have a barrier i have a constraint i can't because of whatever what's actually happening to
 you you're being called up that's what i call it anyway you're being called up you're being
 given an upgrade and if you take a certain path what are the chances you're going to die right
 you're gonna figure it out you're gonna figure it out and so she leaned in and that's my challenge
 to each of one of you guys is to lean in so here's the five steps in one slide so you can just see
 them right set number one what's the business problem that you want to solve for an existing
 business right what do you want to solve that existing businesses value you don't get to choose
 what's valuable they do what's a valuable problem to an existing company that you want to go solve
 number two what type of customers you want to work with to do that number three kick up some leads
 email if you can you can't that doesn't mean you can't do this how else can you reach people i don't
 have an email list i messaged keep on linked in use social media go into the facebook group
 of the click false facebook group and say i'm looking to do a swap with somebody i'd like to get
 funnel hacking live in exchange i'll return from funnel hacking live and i'll build you this funnel
 and whatever rustles top you know i'm saying does that make sense start bothering start making trades
 right number four follow up with leads like crazy you're gonna repeat steps three and four
 like mad people for the next few weeks just do it it'll work you just do it right set number five
 obviously deliver on your deal whatever that deal is that you chose on and then come back
 and create a situation where you could serve them even more and they get to serve you even more and
 i guess as it opens more doors for you maybe if possibly changes the train tracks in your life
 that was something that i said though um as someone close to me as soon as i got hired by rustles i
 sent a message and i was like the train tracks of my life i just hopped tracks i didn't scoot further
 down the train track i actually leaped whole tracks and that's what you have an opportunity to do
 here as well okay so i'll give you guys one more step and this uh just to spot check you as you go
 here is that all right i know i've been going for a bit now wrapping up coming up to very anterior
 um very anterior children say am i but don't say i am
 what is that inner voice inside of you being if you get somebody inside your head it's you
 you get a little voice in your head that's going but steve could do it because he
 blah blah blah blah whatever that thing is i want you to challenge the voice in your head and say
 who said that who said that was it my inner child thank you well meaning child but go play
 somewhere else or was it the adult was it the child or was it the adult okay children wonder
 where they stand adults declare and own it and see it through i make i am statements i am a funnel
 hacker i am a capitalist pig i am rich i am going to be very big i am very positive of all those
 statements i am an amazing father okay the i am statements that you make is what is really
 pulling things and opportunities in front of you and right now you probably have said something
 like ooh i want to be a funnel hacker doesn't work like that i am but it's not confidence it's
 certainty okay and that's how you declare and move you're not at the whims of this life
 okay it's for you to come in and take and make whatever experience you want because it's your
 experience see exactly what you're looking for so i call this the five-year-old mafari i don't
 want you guys to be a five-year-old mafari um i run into this my own event sometimes i do a lot
 of events a lot of events and i do a lot of training i teach people a lot um all this stuff um as you
 can tell and um there's this there's this idea that i talk about a lot called the five-year-old
 in the Ferrari but i've just tended you is the Ferrari and what what happens sometimes is
 someone gets the Ferrari for the first time they get to understand it mentally they see the model
 they're like oh my gosh and they start seeing where it could bring them and look how far i could go
 in this Ferrari but they get in it as a five-year-old emotionally their emotional intelligence is only
 the emotional intelligence of a five-year-old and so what do you think happens they get inside the
 they get inside the Ferrari and they're like i can't reach the pedals therefore this car must suck
 and steed's lying and i always tell people be aware of it you know getcha
 be aware of the five-year-old in the Ferrari is there anything really wrong with the Ferrari?
 no it's a Ferrari what's wrong you haven't grown
 don't blame the vehicle because it's asking you to grow
 do you wear the five-year-old in the Ferrari you're being given a Ferrari
 and so check yourself and that's why i keep saying that inner self-talk that's going but can i
 am i will i those are all children phrases that's the five-year-old in the Ferrari am i can i can't even
 see a vestibule am i can i will i i am and accept the growth and watch yourself become someone that
 you would never be able to create on your own right so be open and honest right if you're struggling
 to have two thousand dollars to a ten-in-a-fend that you know you should be at you're probably
 just living your future hook i'm funny i know i am funny i'm a goofball but i want you to understand
 how powerful these are but these are frameworks i keep my head and sometimes i've asked myself like
 oh there's nothing wrong with the car i've been given i've been especially when you're at funnel
 hiking live do you think it's going to be any different when you're a funnel hiking live and
 then suddenly someone who's very rich stands up on stage and says here's how i did it and here's the
 model and then you hold it and you're like that's cool but they can do it because they're big and i
 am not it's like i'm gonna stop you gotta get have a plan for that kind of crap and say all right this
 is a Ferrari i'm still an emotional five-year-old in this skill set i'm not gonna blame the messenger
 or the Ferrari for being a Ferrari what's the variable here me and that's not a bad thing
 entrepreneurship is the fastest personal development most tailored personal development course you
 didn't know you were enrolling in when you said yes to it you're gonna have this feeling a lot
 so not just gonna start or stop with this one it's gonna happen all the time and so i've
 got to prep your brain for it you want to go figure out how to get a funnel hiking live come up with
 a plan do it no one told me how to go i didn't have any tell me this stuff i said you know what
 how can i afford it i got the skill set i don't have money but i got a skill
 let me go find someone i'm gonna barter my way there it's as simple as that
 and just do it it's as simple as that okay i shall find you and i shall hug you
 sounds good i look forward to it i seriously i want to see you guys there i i'm so
 forward to seeing you guys there um now one last thing i'll tell you guys is i want you to lean on
 the community also i would go and make this kind of a post and i would say hey
 guy i want to get the funnel hiking live i am solving problem for dream customer
 i want another clients or i want my first client whatever it is tell the truth
 don't read though none of the pretending crap the internet marketers do tell the truth whatever
 scenario you're in i want my first client all my next client and i want it during the month of
 september and i will take a plane um i'll take a plane an event ticket as my payment instead of
 money please help me find you i am a funnel hacker okay and you'll be you'll be shocked at how many
 people are already doing this by the way i'm just trying to help you guys get aware of it that
 people doing this right now because people seem to be doing it so i'm hoping that this has brought you
 belief okay you have all the tools i'm hoping that it helps remove some fog but just look at it
 as an opportunity to grow and be grateful for that but this is going to be something that changes you
 and it's going to change you faster than you ever could i was so shy when i was a kid i went to
 therapy because i couldn't speak to other adults i couldn't do this everything you've seen now
 of me doing what i am now is something that i crafted and i crafted it by saying yes to environments
 that freaked me out right and the freak out leaves within minutes you just have to get through the
 first like two steps you know what i mean and then you're like all right it's fine nothing's coming
 to attack me there's no giant shark that's going to come bite my legs off you know i'm saying like
 all the scary scenarios in your head i'm going to jump out of a plane i better build that parachute
 before i hit the ground the funny thing is the ground never comes it's this imagined thing and
 it creates anxiety in you right and so i just i really hope that this has been some real talks
 you can understand how to do it so just again real fast recap on the steps what problem do you
 want to go solve it's valuable for a company to have solved number two what types of companies
 you want to do this for number three kick up those leads four follow up with leads number five
 deliver and then circle back around and keep serving the person said yes to you because my
 guess is it's going to open up some new doors in your life guys thank you so much i appreciate
 it appreciate your time hopefully this has been helpful for you i believe in you and even if
 no one else in your life knows what the heck you're doing or what a funnel is let's say hi to
 each other funnel i can live i always meet you guys who have been coming um last year i met
 a guy who's sleeping under a table in the hallway bootstrap is way there because of falling the
 story that i've just laid out uh every year i meet somebody who's bootstrap their way the year
 before that a guy ran up to me on day three if i'm a hacking live and go Steven i bootstrap my way
 here i'm so excited to be here um but i launched my first funnel on day one because i've been sleeping
 in my truck i just got my first sale i'm booking a hotel night i get to sleep in the hotel tonight
 i hear those all the time and they make me cry okay i'm tender on the inside very hard x theory but
 i'm totally jelly on the inside um you guys are awesome okay keep going at it the world changes
 because of you not because of the uh government and um i will see you guys at funnel hacking guys bye
