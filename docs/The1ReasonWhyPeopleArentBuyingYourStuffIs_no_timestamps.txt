 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing secrets podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right, everybody I know it's been a little while
 Actually started recording a podcast a couple days ago and then it crashed in the middle of it
 and then it's just been a super busy week and having had a chance to get back to it
 so I apologize but I'm just right now as we speak driving home from the two common club X event and
 and
 Had an amazing time Alex Sharf and Todd for the last two days all about
 Building your team and like figuring out with your team like what's your hall of fame goals?
 And your Super Bowl goals and then what are your base on that?
 What are your yearly plans your quarterly plans your monthly weekly daily and like so much cool stuff
 It's all the things that are so essential in the business that
 You know outside of creating amazing offers a product and marketing and also by like talking about it's the next steps
 Like if you want to scale like those next pieces and so those involved in the two common club
 Coaching program, you know, that's what we do. We bring all the coaches to bring all the pieces so you can get everything in one one spot
 And so they may necessarily mean be wondering how do I get inside the two common club X coaching Russell?
 This sounds amazing and the answer is you can't ha we only sell at funnel hacking live
 And so but the good news for you is that the sales page for my king live
 literally went live
 today, so
 If you're not if you if you want to come to experience the best of what ClickFunnels has come to funnel hacking live
 I'm not gonna root spoil it by telling you speaking or the special guests or the private concert or anything
 Things are happening, but do you want to see it all go to funnel hacking live calm?
 And I'm just so excited this event is gonna be every year we try to take it up to its three notches
 I think we did it in this year and I cannot wait for you to be there so
 Yeah, that's where I'll kind of leave that and
 Go from there. So anyway, there's only things I'll talk to you about and I have kind of a long drive home
 So I may cover a couple different topics here and I hope you guys don't mind
 But that'd be kind of fun. So just some things that have been on my mind lately. So
 The first one I'm not gonna mention names because it doesn't matter and I wouldn't that anyway, but
 It's just something happened this week that I
 Think I've even done a podcast on this in the past
 But I wanted like bring it to your attention because it's something that I think a lot of people are missing
 It's funny. I had a friend a little while ago. He told me he was like
 There's this internet marketing
 Like on pirate sites where you can let go and like basically every course is ever been given by any person of all time
 You can go and you can download for free and
 And it's funny. I was talking to him and he's he's successful now
 He said you know what's interesting?
 He said I had an account today to that site nice download every single person's product
 I used to go through him and learn him and study him. He's like, well, what's weird?
 So I never actually made money
 Until I felt so guilty that I stopped my stop stealing people's stuff and then actually went and
 Paid money when I invested money it shifted. He's like that shifted for me. He's like that I shouldn't have a success
 He's like it literally when I was stealing people's stuff. I couldn't make money and when I started buying people's stuff
 Then people started paying me for my stuff and he's so weird nice kind of smile. I said well makes a lot of sense
 You know we had some of that happen this week in our inside of our when our coaching programs and
 I feel bad for the person now. They anyway, I'll leave it at that, but
 You know, they they were trying to figure out a way like how can I how can I get all this stuff for free?
 Like maybe I can cancel I can share my password or you know something at that and always for things and and and
 But at the core of that is is the reason why
 most people
 struggle have success because if you're
 If you're willing to see somebody at creative value and you look at that and you're like, I'm gonna go
 I'm gonna go take that I'm gonna steal I'm gonna I feel like I should I
 Deserve that without paying for or whatever that that is like you receive value without giving value back like money is value
 So you get somebody value money and they give you value back the thing they bought if you go and just take that without ever giving value
 I don't know if it's karma or the universe or what but there are definitely forces
 At large that'll keep you being from being successful if you're not willing to pay for other people's
 Value nobody's gonna be willing to pay for yours. I guess it's really weird law that is true in this universe
 I remember when we first started our company and we couldn't afford like all these things like
 I don't know microsoft word and I don't know all the different things right?
 We had a couple of employees and I couldn't afford for all these things
 I was just like let's just let's just get the get a download key and we'll just unlock them and and we did that for a while
 We struggled and we struggled and I remember having that realization in my own mind like
 I'm like I'm literally pirating the software and I'm trying to sell software like I'm a bad person like I'm doing this wrong
 So I went back and like in fact I had an employee that we we fired it's funny
 He came back afterwards and he was like I know I could tell you know
 I could turn you guys in for downloading software illegally and using all these things and I was just like I remember feeling really really bad
 About that and swim back later and actually went and bought the software very head for free because I was like
 We're out of congruency with the universe with the with with God with whatever you want to call it
 And when you do that, it just doesn't it doesn't work and so we shifted that way back and started paying for those programs
 Um that we could barely afford and guess what happened?
 magically after paying for the things we could barely afford we started making up money we could afford
 Um all the things we needed so there's a there's a lot of there
 I know what it's called
 but I just wanted to share it with you guys because
 um I think it's something a lot of people struggle with a lot of times I see this too when people are creating products and they're like oh no
 But I would never pay a thousand dollars for a coaching course or the 25,000 or whatever it is right
 Uh one of my favorite stories
 Justin and Tara Williams who are some of my favorite people
 uh they
 They uh they came to funnel the first flocking live and they came they're like we are not going to buy a coaching
 They like hid their wallets in the hotel room and during the first break they
 Ran up grabbed their wallets and came down and signed up for a $25,000 thing
 I remember the very first meeting they came to and they were trying to figure this stuff out and all you know how to do it
 and uh
 And basically I I told them like you guys should launch a
 $25,000 group and they're like ah people are gonna pay that and I was like you guys just did
 Like you literally paid for 25 grand to be here like people will pay you 25 grand to stay in your room and learn about real estate
 And they're like oh and so they went home. I don't know if that night or the next week or something
 They send a email out to their list and like hey, we're doing this thing is 25 grand
 And literally I can't really exact numbers is like 16 or 18 people sent them $25,000 that fast
 But it wasn't until they had paid $25,000 that they had the permission to go ask other people for that
 It sent me for me. I couldn't go sell a 50,000 or 25,000 or $10,000 program tonight bought one
 Right and there's something there's like a belief level like until you're willing to part for that kind of money
 It's hard for you to be willing to ask other people for that money and read it
 For your thing. It's it's like the weirdest conundrum
 Um and a lot of these people get stuck like I can't figure out why I can't I can't have success
 I'm like, well, what was the last time you bought a program similar to yours?
 Like oh, I don't you know, I don't buy stuff like that. I'm like, why not like oh, I can get a free on google or I can whatever
 I'm like, okay those those belief patterns in your mind are we're keeping you from having success and keeping
 You from like helping your customers succeed because
 Subconsciously, if you're not conscious, you're trying to pitch and tell them give you a thousand bucks subconsciously
 You know in your mind right? Oh, well they could probably get on youtube
 They could find it here or whatever and all these kind of things right?
 It's not until you go and you invest in yourself you spend a thousand bucks or for 10,000 or whatever that is
 You buy the thing and then when you're trying to pitch something out and and you have a good experience like man
 I bought that thing and it's better my my success
 Then you come back something you say hey, give me 10,000 dollars because I'm the speaker of success in my in your area of expertise
 You don't feel guilty because you know what that meant to you
 You know how that affected you how it changed your life how it sped up your process, right?
 And so I think it's just super hyper important and
 This is a thought of something I want to share with you guys as I was driving home today. So
 Yeah, I'm not saying you should go and
 Give all your money to everybody but you should definitely give it to uh to uh the people you trust
 And uh, hopefully we're someone you trust and if so you should come to fall like in life
 Like I promise you that experience will give you the emotional impact and the emotional change you need
 um set you on the course you need for your future if uh if you want to go deeper with us that you should join the
 Two-comicalbacks coaching program. We only open it up at fawn hacking life and it's taking you the next step of the process
 Which is what this group is going through right now and um, it's uh, it's amazing

 So, um, anyway, that's what I want to share with you guys
