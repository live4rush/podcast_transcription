 What's up everybody this Russell Brunson welcome back to marketing seekers podcast today?
 I've got two things for you number one. I got kind of a cold so if I sound a little funny
 That's why number two is you guys loved our last three podcast episodes with Josh 40
 So we thought we shoot again
 So today we jumped on a call and we recorded three more episodes for you and they've been a lot of fun
 So the first episode
 was all about just kind of
 It was an interesting conversation
 And I think it took us a while to get exactly to the point but by the end like the end of it wraps for some really cool thoughts and ideas
 I think some clarifications that'll help you guys a lot
 But it's all about like I'm in this world of funnels and like how's that affected my world perspective my world view and everything else happening around me?
 And how does that work for you with the thing that you're most passionate most obsessed with and so I think you guys will enjoy this
 Conversation with that said I'll cue up the theme song we come back of a chance to listen in on a conversation with me and Josh 40
 So the big question is this how are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take our adventure capital?
 We're spending money from our own pockets
 How do we mark it in a way that let's us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 What's up everybody's Russell Brunson welcome back to marketing secrets podcast
 So a little while ago Josh 40 and I did a couple episodes
 We've done this like three times now technically
 This is the fourth but we did an episode a little while ago and just to see how you guys liked it and the feedback was amazing
 I got some good feedback. I think you did as well, right?
 I got tons I sent you some of them. Yeah, we convinced somebody to start a podcast of because of the pot
 Yes, the podcast because of the podcast so we are having little podcast babies now because of what happened last time
 We hung out and I'm pumped so we're jumping back to you. We got three episodes recording today
 I know the title of the topics, but that's about it
 I don't know where we're going the direction, but I'm pumped and excited and just grateful for you man doing these things
 I really enjoyed it last time I left afterwards like pumped in on fire and had a ton of energy
 So I'm excited for this so heck yeah, that's awesome. Well, are you sick? Yes? I have a little stuffy nose
 So I apologize in advance my sound my voice sounds deeper though. So some more masculine was just kind of cool
 Yeah, definitely got a little bit of cold so oh
 Man long as it's not COVID. Oh, yeah, I did that we're good. The antibodies are flowing through my body. So I'm pretty good there
 So I can but well, what's the plan today? What are we talking about for this episode?
 I'd love to get cutting are we doing intros are we just dumb?
 But this is the intro I'll do it. This is it. We're in we're rolling. We're live. Let's go
 We're all right. All right. Let's let's dive in dude
 Interestingly enough as I went back and I started going by the way
 I actually listened to all three of our episodes even though we did them like I actually went back in and listen because I'm that
 Geeky nerd I was talking to one of my friends
 We were sending boxes back and forth to each other and he's like I just listen to my box back to you
 And I'm like I'm glad I'm not the only one that does that he's like oh no you are the only one
 I just did that one time I'm like crap dang it
 I go back through it like listen to voxner I listen to podcast like I'm like trying to figure out how you could have made him better
 But what's interesting is as as I want to take this one a little bit of a different route today to kind of kick things off
 All right, because normally like I
 Say there's like two types of podcasts. There's educational podcasts
 Which is how you're talking on a very specific topic and you're trying to educate people on that and there's entertainment podcasts
 Right entertainment is much more like maybe it's not you know
 It could be educational still but it's not designed to educate you on one specific thing and then break all the beliefs around that thing
 And then you know do the whole perfect webinar thing on a podcast episode and then you know whatever right?
 But rather just kind of have an open conversation
 And I want to open this one up talking specifically about funnels and not funnels and how you build them
 But I want to know like is funnels a worldview for you and what I mean by that is like
 So right now, I'm really really big into storytelling right?
 That's like kind of like my thing that I'm geeking out about is how to tell amazing stories
 And I call it like the master story right like that's the like the core thing that I'm trying to figure out right now
 It's like the master story for me is like though
 What's the one story I got to get people to believe that believe that story like do whatever I want them to do
 Right? It's like the big domino statement of stories, right?
 But as I've done that I've kind of gone out and like everything in my life now revolves around stories
 I'm like oh story there story there. Oh, that's the story. Oh, that's the story there
 And it's like my whole life now is just like I'm just everything is stories, right?
 Yeah, and so you obviously I'm a huge fan of experts secrets and dot-com secrets and you wrote those books and everything like that
 You talk about kind of like the latest world and this identity and bring everybody in and so I'm curious like for you
 Like I want like where do funnels play into your life?
 Besides just marketing like is this a worldview is this a wet lens upon which you view the world?
 Yes for sure it is it's interesting
 I
 still remember back when I first gotten this game and I was learning marketing and then I started studying dancanity stuff and
 Started learning, you know, and I remember starting after I got that some of the initial inputs of like this world
 It's like what's the matrix like the red pillow the blue pillow, right?
 I took the pill also is like oh my gosh
 I see the world differently and for me it was fascinating. I started loving I became obsessed
 In fact you asked my wife this we first got married we listened to radio and like commercials to come on and she'd want to change
 I'm like no like like
 Do a good job. They do a bad job. How can they do it better?
 Like I started leaking out on that like I started watching more infomercials
 I started watching like as you go down the highway and you see the billboards like okay that billboard didn't make me do anything
 Did it not like was there called action was there not like if there was what did I get my phone down?
 I called the number like what happened?
 What was the sales pitch and I started like I started seeing like behind the curtain of like what was happening, right?
 And I became obsessed like like seeing that and I remember
 This is probably a little bit prior to this but but after I started seeing things
 I started realizing how things made me feel like I remember in high school
 I got I was a wrestler's, you know, and I was into my my health and fitness
 I didn't understand it back then but I do remember Bill Phillips had a magazine called Muscle Media
 This is probably way before your time
 But it was like the first like muscle building magazine that wasn't like like all the other ones were like these dudes
 You're just like well like steroid it out and like muscle media was like like the dudes and the ladies in it's like who you want to look like
 They thought that looks amazing and and then he had a supplement company called the AS he launched
 And so I got into supplements. I got into Bill Phillips
 I got into like his world like where I was reading his magazine articles and buying his supplements and it was cool
 But I remember I wanted to buy some
 I can't remember their new supplement was and there was a GNC close to my house
 And so we were jumping my bike riding down to GNC being so excited by the supplement
 And I walked through the door and soon I walked through the door of the GNC
 The person came out and I was like hey, how can help you?
 I'm like oh and I kind of freaked out I was like
 Oh, I'm just looking and I got all nervous and then like I kind of wandered away
 And then it felt like the person was kind of following me and everything and I remember like I came there
 Because I want to buy something but I felt so uncomfortable
 Excuse me. I was like eventually I just snuck out and I left and I was like, oh like I didn't get the thing because
 The I felt so uncomfortable in the process that even though I came there with my money in hand ready to buy something
 I didn't because because I like the process and I noticed I don't know if you ever go to a GNC
 So you walk in they always come and they pounce on you and even to this day when I walk in GNC
 It's one of my favorite stores
 But I know the initial anxiety of like the person pouncing on me out if I can help them or what I'm looking for
 I'm looking for I want to literally read the back of every label of every bottle here like like I'll come to you
 If I need to help but don't come and like pounce on me and I just realize that I start thinking like this is my story
 How would I wanted to be approached like what would have I start thinking like the script and I started thinking if I came in the door
 And the person said something like hey welcome GNC today. I'm over here if you need anything. Let me know
 And like it was like more of a deflect like I would have felt more comfortable
 I would have walked walked around that I would have felt comfortable coming back the person and and I just started thinking
 You know through that and and I remember anyway, and that was before I learned marketing
 I remember feeling that way and as I started marketing
 I was like oh my gosh like I now know like why I felt that way like the script was wrong and the process was wrong
 And I started thinking through things more like that
 And I'm sure it was annoying for my family like I'd go to a restaurant
 I would notice like how do the server do things and what do they say and like it just like it started opening up for me in fact
 I
 My junior year in high school during the summer I got a serving job
 And I was serving tables and I remember because I would split test different things to see like what would give me more tips
 Like if I said this thing person versus this and I remember in fact, this is like, you know
 17 year old kid who stuck on themselves
 I was like I rolled my sleeves like my sleeves rolled up and these two more my arms would be higher
 Literally with split test thing to try to figure out how to increase them and
 It's just it's just weird
 So that was like when I was young and definitely like it's it's messed me up nowadays because it's hard for me when I see
 Every ad every everything like I want to go deep into things and I do sometimes but sometimes it takes me long rabbit holes
 So the bad question up, but okay
 Well, I want to kind of do further down deeper into that because I want to expand beyond just marketing as well
 Right because like I think you know any of us is marketers when we have the light bulb turned on
 You know you take the red pill or whatever it is and this is like I remember for me
 I had that first experience with money, right?
 Like I grew up in a very small like a small small small town like the two towns collectively combined had
 750 people in them and like one bang in a gas station, right?
 So like very very small world and then like I started learning about money and I'll never forget like the day that it clicked for me
 I was actually out in I'd already moved to Nebraska and I started to realize like how money like flowed
 I got done reading this book and I remember I like I picked up the phone
 I called this you know one of my friends who had been teaching me about money
 I'm like dude I I get it now like I get like everywhere around like I can't not see how money's flowing and where it works
 I'm like this and I have all these questions about it
 Right and so like I totally understand like when your lights come on
 Like you start seeing it the whole world through that for that specific thing
 But what about like I want to know like what about other areas of your life and how funnels and like your viewpoint of funnels has affected that and
 I'm trying to get out and understand is
 You know you talk a lot about in expert secrets like we're building this identity. We're building this community
 We're building this this movement this calling right and what's interesting for me is I've noticed is that when I
 When I first got into this space. I was so new that
 The preconceived notions of what people should do or should not do did not affect me because like I didn't know anything
 So I was like I know I'm an idiot
 I know I don't like like people are like you know you're doing that wrong
 I'm like probably right like and there was no like ego in the way of it right
 But then as I like grew
 I thought there were like certain ways that I like had to think or there were certain things that I had to do
 And then it was like if I broke free from the mold that everybody else was doing then that somehow that was wrong
 Right and I struggled with that not for you know thankfully for me
 I didn't stay in there, but what helped me get out of it is I gave myself permission and I literally was like no
 I'm like I'm doing my own world over here
 Right like everybody else like they can have whatever it is that they want like they can make more money than me
 That's like I'm building this own little thing and when I like I'm envisioned myself stepping into this world
 Then I was allowed to make my own rules right and so like the rules had to follow everything else
 But like people would be like Josh is super weird that you think about everything in marketing and I'm like but that's my world
 Right and so like I everything about my life from the what I buy to where I live to you know
 Who I hung out with or was all shaped around that and for a while that was weird
 Right and like whenever I would go into my friends was like you're weird and I'm like I struggled with that
 But then once I gave myself kind of permission to be like well, that's just how that's literally how I think that's my world
 That's my you know, it's okay to be different like that really freed me and so I'm curious like
 Like how has funnels shaped your world outside of only marketing
 And what would you tell somebody?
 Is it no would you tell someone it's okay to like view the world through whatever their new opportunity is in all aspects of life
 Does that make sense? I think so
 it's interesting because
 I know you're trying to get outside of marketing
 But but fastly because like in my in my vision of the world like everything's marketing, right?
 That's what I'm saying though. That's what I'm saying. Like what I remember
 Like how does that affect into relationships and like when you are dealing with a problem in your family
 Do you like go like like what's the funnel for this?
 Yeah, cuz like how do we
 The story the pitch the thing but it's true cuz like I think about my wife right like when I met her there were multiple people who you know
 She was the prospect of multiple people all competing for her attention
 It was like okay like I've got to create a better offer like I'm not the best looking guy
 So I got like what are what are the tools?
 I have to increase the value of what I have to be more attractive to her and things like that
 You know with my kids right now
 It's tough because now my kids have got so many distractions and there's things that are way cooler than dad
 So it's like I'm always trying to get out lens of okay like wait
 There's people cooler than Russell Brunson what?
 We have profiting hometown they say right like you never cool
 But it's like it's tough though cuz like I'm competing against all of you know for my kids like the rappers that are in their ears
 And I'm you know they're listening to all these people who you know like those that part of the world
 Then they got their friends and they've got these there's so many things we're competing against and say okay well
 How do I like how do I take them on this journey to be able to help you know and you talked about universe building?
 Which is true like in fact
 Just been I'm working with on a project with Dan Kennedy right now
 and it's all about that my concept of universe building and things like that and
 And you know you look at the big companies that have done it successfully
 I it's what they did like Walt Disney built this universe
 I in fact one of the other looks into the interview me and Dan did fun hacking live
 And he talked about Walt Disney who you have to wear the same basically the same business right?
 It's like it's like one had bunnies and one had had rabbits or whatever but
 Bunnies but it's the same business right?
 The people came into and I think about that like we're doing the same thing like like you created universe for your for your
 You're customers. That's a lot of what the experts secrets everything's about creating this customer universe
 But it's true like in your in your office with your with your team is true with your family
 It's true with your relationships like you're kind of trying to to craft this this environment
 to make people first off want to be there and be part of it and then to
 Persuade people to you know hopefully get the things you're looking for like all of a certain persuasion business
 Even we don't want to admit it people like oh I don't persuade people I don't mean to be a people
 But you are like we want to eat for dinner tonight
 You got to persuade the other person like what movie do you want to go to like like are we gonna?
 Are we gonna go out tonight?
 We're gonna sit home and on the couch like you're always in this thing of persuasion and and you know if you look at any kind of
 sells like environment is the number one thing
 Like the biggest one of the most important things you're trying to sell somebody something right is the environment the university put them in
 It's the reason why
 You know if I if I do a pitch on a virtual event where somebody's at their at their own home in their own environment
 I'm giving them a glimpse in my environment. I can convert and I can sell people I do the exact same presentation at
 Funnel hockey live in a room where I control the environment. They're in my universe
 I can like my cells were you know five six six x even though it's a vaccine presentation is actually everything because I'm controlling the environment
 And so my home it's same like how do I control this environment my home and how do I structure things and how do we set?
 You know the same things like you think about
 You know in the click funnels ecosystem
 We've got these awards to calm a couple war to calm come back
 So we have things like that like how do we create these things people to strive towards the side of our families?
 You know we the clinton I did that a couple years ago
 We were trying to figure like what's our like what's our family goals?
 We have a goal like what does that look like what's something that we can collectively all work towards together and
 In the in the Mormon Church like the end like one of the biggest goals is like you want to get married in the temple
 But if you get married in the temple, we have to you have to be living worthy
 Yeah, but all these things to do right and so as a family we set a goal like
 Because I'd explain like
 like if my kids get married in the temple like they're younger siblings won't be able to go because they're not
 Old enough to be able to go into the temple to actually witness the marriage right?
 So the goal we set as a family
 We set a goal like when Nora because nor is youngest when Nora gets married the goal is that we love her to get married
 The temple and we want all of our family to be there
 So means all of our family has lived in a way where we're worthy to be there together in the family
 So that became like our family goal
 It's like this thing we're all shooting towards and it's fun because now when I'm having family conversations my kids
 It's like like hey, you should be doing that. It's like hey
 These are things that are keeping us away from our family goal like we were in 10 years now 15 years ago
 Nora and but the way you're living like you're not gonna be able to do that and so it's less than be like
 trying to
 You know tell them what to do as much as like we know this is the goal
 We've collected we set as a family this we're trying to get to right
 So the amart yeah trying to come up the board like cool
 You can go listen to 40 other gurus if you want but this is the path this is the process like like we can get you there
 But if you're distracting, you know, it's just kind of a similar thing where you set these
 You set the things side of the universe the goals and steps and hopefully everyone not that they will or they want to or you know
 Maybe my kid right side the hate the universe they want to break out of and that can happen to you know people right right?
 Because they don't like to be I talked too fast or I've annoying or whatever they they enter different a different universe
 But that's okay, and so yeah well, but and I think that's that entering a different universe
 I think maybe what I'm trying to get at is like I
 Grew up once again fall down right super poor world and I just figured there was a way the world worked
 Like singular that's how it worked right and like as I've grown up
 I would like was striving to figure that out. I'm like what's the way the world works
 And like I get out there. I'm like oh my gosh
 There's like five million different ways the world works right and like depending upon whose world that you're in and so
 I was watching I was watching the football game last night. We had it on
 There's the Steelers and the Vikings. I don't know by the way
 I know you don't watch football, but I'm gonna make a prediction on here for all my football fans out there
 Patriots are going to the Super Bowl versus Tom Brady's gonna be Tom Brady in the bucks versus the bill bill
 I'm checking Patris in the Super Bowl anyway
 We're watching it last night and they have this documentary that's coming out. Do you know who John Madden is?
 Yeah, yeah, so they have this whole thing on Madden and Madden his whole life, right?
 And it's coming out this is this documentary and they do do a little clips and there's all these different little people talking about it
 And they're like this dude like you couldn't be around him and not love football because like he just he
 Exuded football in every aspect of his life at the dinner table
 I know around his family around his friends at the sport is football football football
 Right and it got me thinking cuz I you know I'm preparing for this interview last night and I'm like
 Hmm that guy's whole life was football. That's how it came about right like there what he couldn't imagine a reality where football didn't exist
 Right yet. There's somebody else out there
 There's millions billions of people out in this world
 Within ever heard of or think about or want anything to do with football right?
 And so here's a guy where his whole life revolves around football all of his analogies all of his stories all of his strategies
 Everything was in your football and then I was like oh I wonder if that's what it's like like living with Russell
 Right, it's like everything is funnels right and it's like funnels funnels funnels funnels funnels funnels
 And I think like I feel like sometimes as entrepreneurs
 I know I struggled with this for a while and I struggled with this a lot more when I didn't know what I wanted to do with
 My life right I when I was still trying to figure out my voice and the kind of everything like that
 But I'm like I just can't be the X guy right because that would be weird like that's not how reality works
 That's not how life works right?
 You don't just get to just focus on all of this
 But I feel like it is and I feel like you don't necessarily have to be a single thing guy
 But I feel like you can right in the sense of and that's what I'm trying to get out with you
 Is like I feel like you've gone into this world and you've found the thing that works right and you've said hey listen
 Basically in life you you have to know where it is that you're going and how it is that you're gonna get there
 Right like that's essentially in life and that's kind of my core premise of everything
 I'm like I don't care how you live in life, but I'm like if you don't know where you're going and how you're gonna get there
 You're gonna live up your your life's gonna suck right?
 It's just you're not gonna have a very fulfilled life
 And so I feel like for you you figured out okay wherever I want to get this is the vehicle
 I'm gonna use and you've built an entire like reality and universe around that yeah
 Yeah, yeah for sure and it's interesting though too because
 I was on the call last night with stupid Claire and their their prediction college here and he was asking my predictions for the future and I
 It's interesting because
 Yes funnels is like my the thing right it's like my lens and that's what people come to me like it's the the lens
 They come through but I think it's fascinating and I see this with with
 In fact I know Stu I'm like there's an evolution like people were experts for a while then they became influencers
 And I think the next phase
 It won't stick people still call themselves influencers because it sounds cool when they feel you know
 They've got a significant stuff that but I think the next phase is is people are gonna become curators more so which is like someone
 Comes to me for funnels right but it's interesting because like my last inner circle meeting you people pay 50 grand to be in the room
 There's a hundred people this room and we're they're here because they want to learn funnels from Russell right?
 So we're talking about funnels that let me open for Q&A and guess how many funnel questions came through
 Zero the question
 Russell I came to you for funnels, but I trust you
 I like you and they wanted and they didn't say this but this is what happened is they this they wanted to figure out how I
 Curate like they want to be a curate other thoughts for them like I trust you in this therefore
 Like what do you think about religion and like they want me to take all my years of curation of all ideas?
 Like this is what I believe or like or like how does your family successful?
 How does and so they asked asked me other questions?
 And so I think for now, so let's do last night
 So you like the membership guy right people come for your memberships, but but after they come in like that's what brings them into the door
 But then you know that they're coming because they want your curation of other ideas like Dan Usher
 I think you know Dan on our team he was as fast as he could yeah his favorite band is Rufus or something like that
 I don't really know the band that well
 But he's like obsessed with them and their music and so he like follows them
 He loves them and everything and he just bought his first house out here and boy is he so he needed to like get art on the on the wall
 He's like well, I love Rufus
 I trust them they've curated their favorite artists who went bought everything that Rufus ever said like they're like for
 Art and put it on his walls they cool because I trust them therefore
 I want this and then like he bought the furniture that they have in their house because he trusts their opinion on this and other things
 And and so I think it's you know mad
 I'm sure like the footballs of brings people in and they come there at the Senate table for that
 But it's like if they like him and they connect with them
 Then it's like they want to know like what else do you want to know?
 I want to go on these other rabbit holes with you because I trust you and I trust your opinion
 I trust you know because you've already kind of done that so I think for me that's probably more so
 Is they coming from from one thing but then
 It's it's it's if they connect with you then they want to dive deep on all the other the other pieces of things that you find fascinating
 Yeah, yeah, and and you get that like that's the
 It's almost like they need to step into your universe
 And then you get to build the rest of the universe out for them simply because you built trust in that one. Yeah, it was fascinating
 so I
 If you were in wine back in my history 15 years ago it was tough because
 When I was trying to create my universe and I know that's what it's called
 But like it was funny that there was a few look at the the landscape in our industry back then it was interesting
 There's like Jeff Walker was the launch guy Frank Kern was like the mass control guy
 Phil same was the butterfly marketing person everyone had like a had a thing where they were the best like
 Brad Fallon was
 SEO and then you had Perry Marchers
 PPC and everyone had their thing and I came in I was like I was good at all of us
 I'm like, oh, I'm the guy who did everything and I go to events
 But I go what do you do? I'm like, oh, I like what do you need like I'm gonna copyright anything and I could do all the things
 People like oh, okay, but then they go and they'd sign up for Jeff for lunch
 I'm like I can do lunch site for tons of launches and then or they go to you know
 Whoever for copywriting John Carlton copy I'm like, oh like I've done all these things
 But there wasn't like a thing it wasn't like I I
 Specialized like okay
 I'm the like funnels is the thing and it was it was a narrow focus people could like attach a thing in there
 Like oh Russell's a guy does funnels and they do that they come in my my into the like that's the doorway that brings them into my world
 Right, but then inside the funnel world. What is there? Oh there you can launch a funnel. There's copywriting. There's traffic driving
 There's all these other things, but like I had to bring him in through through a channel
 They could connect what they could like label me with you know what I mean
 But after and that's all sorts of stuff I can do with them
 And that's what like I feel like that right there is the course that I'm trying to get after was like I
 think a lot of people
 Struggle with or are afraid to claim their thing because they're like I can't just claim it
 right like
 Funnels like Russell could claim funnels because that was a thing
 But was it a thing before Russell like was there a funnel guy like you are the one that came in and no one
 He came to you and was like Russell you're the funnel guy go right like you were the one that had to decide that
 Right you were the one that had come in and be like it is fast
 You know what I was the one back then talking about like there was there was a bunch of people in fact I remember
 We had started the time I started building click funnels and I remember about that time
 It was TNC so it was the TNC before we launched click funnels when we got TNC we're sitting their audience and you know
 Tod I am mapping things out and we're talking back forth and the entire TNC that event was about funnels
 It's a rhyme about stage parries on stage talking about funnels they develop like like this is the funnel framework for all funnels
 They sold the 18,000 our funnel coaching program like half the room signed up and all this stuff and I was like oh my gosh
 Like that's what we're trying to go
 But they just took it from us
 You know and then it was crazy is that after that TNC then the everyone's talking about funnels
 And it was funny because like the next week everyone became a funnel consultant also like two thousand little funnel consultants were running
 on the internet every time about funnels and I remember
 Mike Philstim had done something showing back behind the scenes was funnels and I remember someone else got mad
 I'm like like we're the funnel person you shouldn't be talking about this and I remember Mike and him were fighting back and forth
 I was kind of watching this and I was like, huh?
 We have this offer coming out called click funnels and I had this book
 I'm writing this almost done called dot com secrets is all about funnels and like it's like I was stepping in this thing
 When there was a whole bunch of noise around this topic
 And I couldn't have been like oh like who my I'm not qualified like you know, whatever
 But instead I was like, you know what like this is where I'm obsessed with like and I'm just gonna do my thing
 And I'll come everybody else and so I just did my thing and came out there and I'm there are people who were who?
 Can't tell the actual stories, but there are people who are upset like you should be talking about your also
 so and so thing and then
 At TNC the next year there's some weird comments from stage made about stuff because in fact somebody said from stage like
 Because what we talked about last year at TNC Russell event
 You know Russell create click funnels because of us and like gave them credit for this thing and it was just like
 It was just craziness, but man
 We were the only ones who like who took it and then we're consistent consistent consistent consistent. I'm seven almost eight years
 Into the consistency, which is how you define the path, right? That's how you get the idea
 Jeff Walker's been talking about the product launches for 20 years therefore
 He's a product launch guy people started to come to make dethrona
 But he's been consistently talking about the same thing for so long that you can't and slowly the big things like picking the platform
 And then you just triple down on it
 And you keep doing it and doing it and doing it and eventually you will rise the the victor
 But most people don't have the
 The long-term like the patience right keep just drilling in for for long enough to make it stick
 Yeah
 And I think that a lot of times at least in my experience and it could be different
 You know for other people but like a lot of times like because you're just not confident enough in it
 Yeah, right like there the only thing that's gonna be the difference of whether or not it's gonna stick or not is whether or not
 You're confident enough to follow through right and nine
 That's not necessarily true for every single product to every you know universally sometimes
 The wrong you know the market doesn't fit and sometimes it's you know there really is if you try to launch a
 competitor iPhone right now you're probably not gonna you know probably not gonna make it right but like
 Generally speaking especially in our world with funnels and experts in you know a lot of online influence for marketing and things of that nature
 It's like basically whoever sticks out of the longest and then creates the clearest simplest stories the clearest simplest frameworks
 And the easiest way of people to be able to get results with it are the ones that are actually gonna make it and fall through
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's so much alright
