 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and I'm excited you are here today on the marketing secret show
 So thanks for hanging out today. I'm gonna talk about probably the most simple funnel business model of all time
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 All right everybody so I hope you guys are all doing great I
 Like there's so much chaos happening in my world right now between the rewrite and the expert secrets book and the dot-com
 Secrets book in the launch the traffic secrets book. What's fun. I can live take this plus today. We launched the marketing secret show plus
 My kids are wrestling and a bunch of other like it's just it's chaos and it's fun and it's exciting and like
 Someday I know I'm gonna look back on like this time alive and be like remember that when all that was happening
 Sometimes though it feels like a lot, but it's it's cool and I'm a last night was kind of fun
 I was at my kids wrestling tournament and I was talking to Toby Brockner is one of the one of the
 He's a click funnels fun hacker dude. He's awesome
 He's also a wrestling dad and he comes in one films the my kids was she really cool. We're talking about
 just business and business models and things like that and and
 As I said, they're talking to I can't remember what we were talking about exactly
 but I remember
 Thinking about this and then telling them I was like man
 If I was to start over today right now, like what would my business bottle be look like what would it look like?
 And as much as I love this journey of building click phones and spend so much fun and it's
 So fulfilling and so many you know so much amazing this has come from it like if for when I was to start over again
 Like I would I would make things so much more simple
 And and so I want to you know people I've asked me all the time like if you're a starboard from scratch
 What would you do right now?
 And maybe it's just because I'm in a season of my life that's so hectic so busy that I'm just like I want simplicity
 But if I could step back and like what would be the business model
 I would do today if I was starting today, it would be it would be really simple in fact the person
 Who I would probably model the most is Ben subtle so me hasn't ever been so before talk about him a little bit
 I'm a doc on secrets book and things like that, but his business model is so simple
 He has a squeeze page
 Okay, where he drives traffic to and it's just basically it's like hey
 Give me your email address. I'm an email every day and share with you
 Stuff right and that's what he does and he drives some try
 He drives that much traffic. I think he does a few things here there. I think a lot of leads come for me because I talk about him a lot
 And you know, but he's not like a hardcore buying a bunch ads all sorts of stuff
 He does podcast interviews and he's doing doing things
 But he's definitely not like like me who's out there like obsessing over traffic and sales always cut
 you know
 He just he's doing his thing and he builds the list and then he emails the list every single day and
 He always tells a story. This is where the whole concept of sign filled emails came from in the doc on secrets book
 He writes an email each day about what's happening his life and so now ties it back to his product
 And he's got one product for sale. There's one product is a 97 dollar month newsletter
 And that's it and so once a month he writes a newsletter a print newsletter than he prints and ships out his customers
 He sells it for 97 bucks a month and then
 30 days a month one day, you know every month he writes an email and sends his list and that's his business model
 I gets what 15 minutes a day to write an email and then maybe a couple hours each month write the newsletter
 And that's it and the rest of time he sits there and writes zombie novels and stuff like that like that's his
 That's what he does because it sounds like fun to him apparently you write zombie books and stuff like that
 but like that's that's the business model and
 I've been watching do it consistently now for probably seven or eight years and he just sends an email every day
 He never misses a day very consistent very consistent writes an email sends it out and emails aren't super complicated
 They're telling cool stories or different, you know
 I it's what we call them sign filled emails watch the show of Seinfeld about like the random thing at the time and and
 That's happening his life and how it ties back to the to his email newsletter and in fact if you go to Ben settle comm
 Let me do right now to make sure it's still there
 But he's got a blog where he then posts his emails as blog posts
 You can literally go back and look at the last
 Eight years five. I don't have my years ten years of him doing this you can go read every email
 So you can get an idea like what are the emails look like like well there they are
 Yeah, if you go to Ben settle comm
 SCTLE calm and click on no thanks, and then takes you to his blog
 and
 Yeah, every blog post is in here
 so
 There there you go like they're all they're all in here
 They each have a story and then tie back to his to his nice little news letter tells a story back news
 Like that's it and like the blog game feel the blog. There's literally
 However many years a decade worth of these it consistently doesn't he rarely if ever misses a day and just writes an email
 it sends it out proceeds one thing and
 Yeah, I think sometimes especially for me like I'm so
 Passion about the art of this you know the funnels and funnel structure and all that things
 So because that I create a lot of funnels and stuff like that
 It's like yeah
 But if I was to step back and say look I really want to design my business around me around my lifestyle
 Like I would look at Ben's model super close have squeeze page
 I which I lead to give people opt in email list every single day and I'd sell my one product
 I would just consistently make that product awesome
 It would be a print newsletter or something maybe it's membership side or whatever
 But she's always pushing people to the same thing you think about it like the math on that let's say it's a hundred bucks, right?
 You get you get a hundred people in there. That's 10 grand right 10 grand a month you get 500 people in the units
 That right 50 grand a month
 Yeah, 50 grand a month you get thousand people in there to hundred bucks
 He's a hundred grand a month like if you just consistently did that consistently focus on that
 It's not gonna happen overnight within a year from now five years now 10 years from now
 You could you could have that and you look at your business at the time
 It's like man make a hundred grand a month and I send out an email a day
 It's 15 minutes a day my time and once a month I read newsletter
 so I'm just putting out there for you guys just to think about different business models and you know you don't always have to
 Try to build a huge company and for some of you guys
 That's the goal I get that I support that we teach that we trade on that
 But for some of you guys like I'm looking for something that can be consistent like hey
 What what can you be the best in the world at create a print newsletter or a membership side or something around that thing?
 That's monthly have a squeeze page have an email a day always pushing people back and focus continually on on your message the same message over
 And over and over and over and over again, so hope it helps
 I think for somebody out there who is getting overwhelmed by like oh there's always fun
 All these things like I need a simpler business model. There's a simpler business model. I want to show it yesterday
 So that's a thank you guys so much for everything
