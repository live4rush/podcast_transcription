 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson. You guys are catching me at a rare time
 I'm actually doing house work. My wife has gone a couple of my kids are at
 Napos and birthday parties and I got to do a couple tours so I was working on a
 listing of podcast thinking and also I was like I gotta share this so we're
 doing an impromptu marketing series podcast. So the big question is this how
 are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for
 spending money from our own pockets how do we mark it in a way that lets us get
 our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the
 world and yet still remain profitable. That is the question in this podcast
 we'll give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets.
 Alright guys so I've got someone in our coaching programs who I love and care
 about and respect and someone who has had a lot of successes you know two
 comic-club winner for sure and sorry my wife's license plate thingy broke so
 keeps flapping out and it's been like six months and she keeps hinting towards
 the fact that it needs to be fixed and so finally taking the time to make it on
 I love you. Alright so I'm fixing her thing while we're talking. Anyway so this
 person launched a launch webinar got to million bucks and then kind of
 transitioned to and like I think loved the market and the thing initially and
 then and then kind of fell out of love with it and some because that
 transitioned to a new product created the product did the ads
 launched another webinar had success there and another one and kind of his
 kind of transition couple and that person is kind of frustrated because
 they're like well I'm stuck it I'm stuck it you know million bucks a year and
 they want to be it they want to grow they want to get a 10 million bucks not
 because of the money but because the impact they want to grow and so there's
 goals and you know how to get 10 million bucks a year and and they're
 frustrated and I was just like thinking and they messes me yesterday and so I'm
 talking to him and kind of thinking through it and then for the last day or
 so it's just been like in my in my mind resonating like what like what's
 wrong like this person has all the skills that they have all the talents
 have all the abilities like why why are they not why are they not getting
 next level like what's the thing and start thinking back about what I'm gonna
 be speaking a lot about fun hacking live but the process going from zero to
 million million to 10 and 10 to a hundred sorry I'm such not a handyman I
 can't figure out how to get these things to work anyway and so that was my
 thoughts I was like well okay we know that from going zero to million it's all
 about figuring out the what and the how what are you selling that people actually
 want to buy and then how are you selling it's like you do it through webinar you
 doing through you Amazon is it what's the thing and after you figure out the
 what this is where I'm selling and this is how the how the people want to buy it
 what typically happens is in your business boom explodes really fast I tell
 people that they know when they fit though they're what in their house because
 they'll go from zero million dollars really fast Dan Henry's the example
 what is how from zero to a million five months like it's pretty it's pretty
 simple concept so but it takes a while initially some people spend their whole
 lifetime figure out the what now sometimes feel what to sell like I forgot
 the coolest product everybody can't figure out how to sell if you know how to
 sell this on the right product things like that and so for this person they
 done that multiple times if you got the what now hit up to million dollars and
 then they and then they they shifted the next thing and and I was in that cycle
 for like 12 years so I'm probably a good coach for this because I had done it a
 lot a lot of had a lot of good businesses but nothing that was great right and so
 yeah I can't fix license plate I'm giving up anyway I tried I get brownie points
 for trying right so what in how right and so I started thinking and I was like
 okay from zero to millions what in the house a million to ten is all about like
 the back end and the front end funnels the front funnels bring more leads in
 back and funnels go deep inside of that thing and also I had the epiphany I was
 like oh my gosh this is it so I started thinking about quick funnels right so
 quick phones for example as you guys know the thing I think I had five or six
 different funnels I tried before we had the one that hit right and the one that
 hit was the funnel hacks webinar and it was just like boom it blew up now if
 you look at fast for now click phones has been alive for a little over three
 years almost wait there are bura anyways almost three years I don't know something
 like that so almost three years and what's interesting if you if you look at
 it if you do the actual math of the funnel hacks course nine hundred nine
 seven dollars we sold about ten thousand ish copies little more than that but
 let's say ten thousand for number say okay so that means ten million dollars
 we made from the webinar which is awesome right anyone else I tend to
 million dollar webinar that's great but ten million dollar webinar like comes
 and goes like I say it's probably one of the best on the best in our industry
 but that would have been that good of a story we're also my ten million bucks if
 you look at it now we will we're in now we're in September October by November
 click phones will have passed a hundred million dollars in collected sales I know
 because I have this countdown clock where every single day my accountant lets me
 know how much further we are away from that because I want to know how long I
 can go from zero to a hundred million dollars and we're close so I will hit
 this year for sure it'll be November and so that's exciting right but I was
 looking like the webinar only made ten million means the extra 90 million came
 from something else so where that stuff come from and that's where it came
 something like going deep right from going from from from zero to millions
 about the one half a million to ten it's about it's about the front end and the
 back end funnels right so front end is more ways to bring leads in right so we
 had the books expert seekers doc on the secret perfect webinar I think that
 bring leads in to the business click funnels comms the front end you know all
 the stuff like that then you've got the back end funnels are going deep right and
 so what's cool about it is I started selling you know other things related
 funnels so stuff I could share you guys but if you're at the expert seekers book
 talk about opportunity switch and then opportunity stack right so each
 business every business only one switch I switch people into funnels and I
 stack things within that market we do this correctly you have compounding
 interest I'm gonna spend it here in a minute but I switched over so like when
 someone comes in and click funnels then we've got other products and services to
 help help them better at that thing that that's the opportunity to switch them
 into right switch them into funnels then we've got funnel scripts we've got
 fill your funnel which are traffic course we've got our certification program we've
 got our click start funnel for people getting started click phones we got we
 have click funnels we have software for crying out loud we have all these other
 things excuse me that are all tied back though to funnels right so that's how
 we're able to go super super deep and for this person the problem had is that
 they got they got two million dollars and they switched and then they got
 new million dollars and they switched and they keep they kind of switched
 opportunity on person they switched what they're doing they're switching their
 focus switching their branding and nothing against that like I did that as
 well like if I would have if I was stuck with the very first thing that I ever
 did you know we never had click funnels probably I don't talk to figure it
 out eventually I'm sure but but like that's that's the thing like you got to
 figure out that one how not only not just for your customers because again
 you're not helping a customer's boom you're a million bucks fast but then it's
 like this is I want to be in forever because I didn't want to be teaching
 micro continuity forever you know I didn't want to teach 12 month
 millionaire forever and teach all my million dollar first million dollar
 projects like there was a whole bunch from right I think there's seven day ahead
 of the million dollar winners in the early days we hit a million bucks but
 then it's kind of stale and it was like I switched next thing the next thing and
 the next thing and to get to from a million to the 10 into the 100 is not
 going focusing deep and the re one of the main main major reasons why number one
 is because of compounding interest right like getting on my finance guy so my
 finance people out there know this way better me but some famous dude said that
 the grace and mention the world's compounding interest right and Sydney
 is truth like compounding customers right like every single person that buys
 the expert seekers book the doc on six book a watch of the webinar bikes click
 funnels like I'm switching all those people like all those the goal of every
 single one of them just to be completely transparent with no hidden agenda the
 goal of all of those is to give its people that their new opportunity their
 vehicle is funnels right some convincing hey you're an expert you need a funnel
 hey you have an internet business your doc on six book you need a funnel hey
 perfect webinar you need a funnel hey click funnels you need a funnel like like
 that's my only goal like I want to be completely upfront like all my friend
 funnels like that's the goal there's given its people wherever I'm grabbing
 that they need a funnel in fact I'm working right now on a new report called
 network marketing secrets dot com yes I own the domain how cool is that and that's
 the whole problem reason that front is convinced every network market earth that
 they need a funnel and when you simply for other markets like like that's my
 whole thing right now since I'm a believes that they need a funnel which they do
 then now I'm I'm stacking I'm compounding on top of that right so then I
 compound excuse me I compound you know hey if you're funnel you need funnel
 scripts hey if you have funnel you need to traffic to fill your funnel you need
 maybe become certified you may need this you mean it's like everything else is
 just is opportunity stack within the opportunity I switch people into and so
 if you're looking your business and you're stuck at one to three million bucks
 which is kind of where a lot of you know I was stuck out for a decade and so I
 understand this world it's because we keep switching our customers keep
 opportunity switching and we're switching from opportunity to opportunity
 opportunity opportunity and what happens after a while they kind of lose faith
 and you're like oh this person's like tell me all those other things like the
 reason why we've done more in the last three years than the prior decade times
 like five right is because everything I'm doing is like people look at they're
 like no Russell's key still preaching the same thing funnels are the key there's
 just the other thing like how do you get traffic your funnels oh yeah that makes
 total sense oh here's the live event teaching more funnels like like everything
 we're doing stacking upon that and so it's not like I'm switching people from
 opportunity opportunity I'm saying like no you chose the right road this is this
 is the path this is the new opportunity to focus on I'm just gonna give you more
 tools more assets to amplify your experience and make it better for you and
 that's how we go from from a million to ten to a hundred is is that part right
 because funnels are awesome but make my half-click funnels make money off
 funnel scripts make fun like all these other pieces that that lead more people
 into it and so that was what I what I told this person I came back and said
 look I think the biggest problem is not you don't have the skills you do it's
 not even on a creative product you do it's it's that like if you were so
 passionate about that market when you hit a million dollars then you would
 want to be like what software can I create for these people what
 certifications what events what are you would have gone deeper try think of
 those things which are the back end funnels which were the the majority of
 profit that's where for me it's where the other 90 million dollars came from but
 because they weren't as passionate about it they give me the million bucks and
 if you got one how for their customers but it wasn't right for them it would
 have been right for them they were sat there and all day long thing about how
 can I serve this person more what else do they need what else they want they
 would have heard the person's voice over and over and over again they would have
 known right like click phones came out of me knowing if we hear people talk
 about funnels all the time right all these are things like people are telling
 us over and over and over and what they want what they need so we just were
 creating those things for them and that's how the business grows and grows and
 grows and so yeah I think that's that's the key is
 figuring out what and how for your customer but also making sure it's the
 what for you because if it's the wrong business for you it's not something you're
 geeking out about you keep you keep switching that's okay there's nothing
 wrong at that you don't hit hit the perfect business the first time a lot
 times the first getting from zero to million the first time is about you
 getting the skill set and understanding the market and learning all these kind
 of things but same time if you're going there and you're in a million bucks you're
 like I'm not happy here like that's okay like it's okay to back up and shut it
 down and figure out you got all the skills you got the hard part done it's
 easier we re-figure it's gonna figure out like what is it that you're so insanely
 passionate about what market segment what people what problems do you want to
 solve so much so that it's gonna keep you up and I try to figure out the next
 thing like what else do I create what's the next product what software do they
 need what what events like what like what are the training if they bought this
 course what's the next thing they need like what's that and just like that and
 that's I think the key so anyway I just got excited because I said I was talking
 this person and kind of sharing that with them and just whole I have
 compound interest you know that that's the cool things that every single person
 buys on my books they come into my world and now they're gonna buy the next
 thing the next thing the next thing you look at like like all all the other
 revenue is all free like I don't have to repay for that customer I don't have to
 like all those kind of things so it just keeps growing and growing and growing as
 opposed to when you're having things in different markets everything's like
 that it doesn't compound that was my problem before we had 12 companies we
 launched in a 12-month period of time I wish it was once a month one a month we
 launched like 12 at once and so it was even worse but the interesting thing is
 just thinking about you know anybody who bought like the couponing product
 whenever buying the other products that was the biggest mistake and people who
 bought this the weight-loss product never bought the other ones it was just like
 that's the issues like it wasn't compounding we had to recreate customers
 every single time and I think the big first time I understood I was hanging out
 with Ryan Dyson Perry Belcher and they had a whole bunch of businesses and they
 probably I think it kind of strayed from this because they wouldn't deepen the
 survival market then they did within the survival stuff like that but what Ryan
 told me said that he said anytime we launched in the business one of our
 rules is that our existing customer base they have to be wanting to buy it so
 that way we've got free traffic free that we were everything's compounding
 right someone buys this this from this business they might all spike this as
 well and while I agree with that excuse me I'd go even step deeper and not do it
 just just the same market do it within or yeah not just parallel markets I'd say
 pick one market and then again opportunity stack all as deep as you can
 go so anyway that's what I got it's hot in the garage hopefully it's not too
 equity anyway I'm gonna go figure out how to try to fix this license plate my wife
 so she'll be impressed with me that's the goal just all the women out there know
 that men's only real purpose in life is try to impress their spouse that's it
 we're good with everything else so I'm gonna try to do that so when she gets
 home she will be impressed anyway appreciate you guys thanks for listening
 and I'll talk to you as all again soon
