 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson welcome back to the mark and see your podcast today
 I'm streaming to you from the Napoleon Hill room
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we mark it in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey, what's up everyone so
 Yeah, I think I told you guys in the last episode or so how I basically bought like two or three thousand books
 all in person with a helmet and we had moved into this separate office while we're building our future library and
 What's cool about this is now there in this this little office with no windows or anything and all the books are here
 They're out and I'm just I'm gonna start coming here every morning the first two or three hours a day and working inside of here
 Which is cool because it's giving me a chance to stand right in the book
 But also inside of that is to build it like I'm writing the book
 I have all the greatest personal books of all time sitting here
 They can go look at it and read it flip through the little magazines
 I can get inspiration from Napoleon Hill himself and a bunch of other cool things
 So I'm really really enjoying this and kind of kicking out and also I would do a podcast from here
 Hope you don't mind
 Because there's so many things I'm thinking about talking about in my head that everyone crazy, but I had one this weekend that was it was huge
 I want to share with you guys and so this is interesting because
 No, I wish I wish you had context
 It was all the guys were Mexico with us at the the two comic club X inner circle slash category King
 Mastermind meetup because we had such a good time
 But I had a chance to do this one presentation
 Which will become chapter one of the book by the way
 So when you get the book someday you have a chance to to go through this exercise
 I'm not gonna walk you the whole thing, but
 It's been interesting because I mean I've been creating this whole thing with success and like how you how you achieve what you want
 It's it's it's fascinating to me because it's all these things
 I always like levers we can pull on and we can do and we can tweak and we start looking at it. There's like and
 So I says me jumping around
 I did a really interesting call Tom Billy and he like took me down this path and I talked to the
 It's got an intel testimony who's the owner of the I and ran foundation the CEO of the I and ran foundation and
 All the people and I just keep like all these pieces that are showing a connect for me
 It's just like so fascinating so exciting
 but anyway, sorry I tell you this because
 one of the big things like
 you know talk about beliefs and rules and values and
 Identity and there's all these different pieces that are around there
 I never knew that like gloom all together
 What was first most second and the chicken and the egg and all these kind of things right?
 But one of my big
 fertilizations that I figured out before the Mashman event of Boise or in Mexico was that it all starts with our values and
 But I have a long time. I was like, hey, what does that mean? Like what are values?
 I don't even like things that are valuable things that I value and it wasn't until I talked to Tal and he's the
 the CEO of the I am round foundation I ran to the one who wrote out
 Out of a shrug and you know fountainhead and all those amazing books, but anyway
 so I
 I
 Talk to him and he told about as extra as he does people because I ran big on values
 That's like the leading thing she talks about and I was like, how do you explain her?
 How do you understand it and and so he he said what I do is like you understand values values are something that aren't like a conscious thing
 It's something subconsciously is happening that makes your brain
 He called the black box inside your brain happy, right?
 And he's like most people don't know what that is like we just are walking our life bumping into things hoping that
 You know be successful be happy and he said the iron ran said that if we were to
 He said they could we spent five percent of our life looking
 introspectively at ourselves in our own mind that we'd be a
 Society or a nation of Giants or something crazy like that and so his whole thing's like better look inside
 Like what is the things that actually make you happy?
 And so he invented this exercise
 That we did with our group. He said you create a value galaxy
 So everybody the event I had a gave everyone the big old thing a sticky notes
 I said okay work for the things you value these things that make you happy
 So give anything from like reading a book or eating sushi or going on a date or making out or you know like
 Winning a wrestling match like what are all the things that bring you happy?
 I see my kids like you know and so I give him like 15 minutes straight on as many values like anything that makes them happy
 they just write those things down and
 Everyone remotely stick notes. We stick them on the little board and you know within 15 20 minutes
 We had everyone had you know hundred different values
 So these are all the things you value us. How many guys when you were doing that you had these new aha's like
 I don't know I forgot about that. I forgot about this the things I've valued I totally forgot about them
 I'm not doing them. I'm not spending time in them
 I think everyone including me had that kind of that epiphany of like oh my gosh like oh
 You can actually value them not focusing on right and then the next thing is he said okay
 This is you know tell us that this is your value galaxy instead of from here
 We're in you got to figure out what are the values themes like those always sticky notes like they're probably grouped together in things
 Like all these 10 or 15 all kind of like relate to my family early to my mission related to whatever those things are right
 So you said let's take this value galaxy and and build it and like move the sticky notes around to just a value themes
 So occasionally value themes and we're done. Everyone had five or six value themes
 And these value things are really cool because they were very much like here's the
 You know the I value my family value religion. I value personal development like whatever your things are right and
 it's interesting because like
 The values are what drive us right like that's that's the things actually makes happy like it's not the goal
 It makes us happy. It's the value. It's like the pursuit in the achievement of the value
 And then from there we do a bunch of other cool exercises
 I'm like talk about on this podcast because it's some of the cool things that were in Mexico and then from there
 We'd like look at the the five or six value
 Things people had them from the value things they picked one
 Value theme that was most important to them right now in their life like maybe it's business or maybe it's family
 Maybe it's sports or whatever like picking that one value theme and then setting your your goal around that one thing and it was
 It was so cool, but the big epiphany I had
 that was fascinating to me as is
 You know, I'm always trying to figure out like how do I know my kids be amazing people and how do I how do I get them to?
 You know - I don't know what to I don't want to say it sounds
 How do you get my kids do what I want them to do?
 I thought I'm saying but like you know
 I mean like there's things that I believe that I have value that I want my kids to value as well
 Right like my my faith my work ethic my you know
 Like these things I value don't like kids value to and it's interesting because most of us including me for a long time
 until until yesterday no to but
 We try to like force our kids to value what we value right?
 But we don't know we're doing that so instead of we do is you set these rules and these guidelines we force them to do this and we like
 Demand them to do this and we try to try to try to get them to do what we want them to do because we value it and support
 us who want to be important them to so we're trying to force them and what's interesting is that like forcing people to
 Have the same value as you?
 Literally in most cases repels them to make some not want to have that value
 But instead it's like how do I inspire them to want to have that value like for my kids for example
 I'm like you have to go to church you have to read the scriptures you have to bubble
 Like you know because I want them to value that that's gonna push me way fast instead
 I got how do I create so they actually value it kind of create experiences and and something so
 Cool that they're like oh my gosh like I value this too and you don't do it by demanding or forcing or sample rules
 That keep them do it instead you by inspiration like how do I how do I show them how this is actually valuable in my life?
 How can I show this valuable there life and I can if I can get them to
 To experience it or to see it or whatever then they'll value it and after they value it
 It's it's everything will take care of itself right now. They value it. They're gonna they're gonna do the things they need to
 to have that in their life
 if if if I'm if I'm not careful like me or you or any of us are going to
 Pull them off the tracks by by trying to
 To you know force these values on people or force your values on people instead
 It's like I need to create an environment where they see why it's valuable and then also becomes valuable to them
 That becomes a value to them. Does that make sense?
 I don't know if that makes sense to you guys, but like I'm freaking out like having this epiphany of like oh my gosh
 Like I've been doing parenting wrong. I've been doing all these things wrong my whole life because now it's like oh
 This is this is the key is helping them to value it not to force them to do it or to set up rules or whatever
 It's getting them to value it and when you ask that question gives you a whole different answer
 Right now. It's like well
 I need to show them the value of praying like let me show them the miracles that happened my life and they're like
 Miracles happen in their life and they're open to understand it so you can see it and then they're gonna start valuing it right
 Let me show you the then show them the value of church like church can be so boring most of the time
 Like how do I make it like that?
 Let me show them I can show them the value that I get out of it and then then they'll more likely to value right or
 I mean create experiences they do value it, you know and so anyway, that was my big epiphany was just like
 Okay, it becomes an illusion my head. This is way more fun of a game. This is a more fun way
 This is a more fun game. It's how to create those kind of things and so it was really cool
 I had a mini experience yesterday with it. That was kind of interesting like
 By default, this is kind of something I think broken inside my head maybe
 A lot of years no like I was a wrestler. I'm you know a good athlete and things like that, but
 It was interesting because I wasn't like I have friends who were just always active
 They're running they're doing stuff and that wasn't me that was wrestling
 I would try not to move the entire day
 I would just say store all my energy and then wrestling price I go crazy for two or three hours
 I go crazy in the wait room and then I would like not move again
 I'd sit home and just watch Stevie or not move and my life nowadays is similar like
 I don't do a lot unless I'm gonna go do something and if I do I go hardcore, right?
 That's like I don't just like I know if I'm gonna if I'm gonna work out like I have to shower afterwards because I'm gonna be a
 Mess right and so I I step back and you know like I don't just I don't I went and jog from my office to my house
 I would never do that
 If I'm gonna do that in a drive home and I get my change clothes
 I'm gonna go super hardcore for an hour than to be done
 And so a lot of times unfortunately for my kids I fall in this rut of like you know
 We're after church wherever we're at home and like okay, we're gonna do it
 It's just like I don't know and I like when my brain did I just want to like not do anything and so that we default to that and
 But I do value exercise I do value doing things
 but in my head that's not my my default right and so yesterday
 one of the our kids friends came over and she's super cool girl really enjoy having her over and
 You can tell her and her value family they value like outside activities
 And so they're there and they're like hey, you know my sons with her and like hey
 Do I have some got signed play bubble soccer and we can play these things and my first default like no
 I don't want to it's like literally kind of like I didn't say no
 But I just like oh maybe and I kind of snuck away and laid down for a little bit because I was tired right and then I
 Had this epiphany I'm like I want my kids to value
 Outdoors and exercise and activities. I need to value it. They don't see me value it and they're not going to either
 And I was like okay, so I got up got dressed and I was like alright and it was crazy
 They'd already got outside and so I ran out there with them
 I got the other kids out there and we end up playing like three or four hours. It's so much fun
 Exercising running and playing games and not and what was done in my head
 I was just like oh my gosh like they saw that I value this and they had a good time
 So they're gonna value it and they're more likely to go and do these kind of things born future and with their kids and things like that
 I'm like that's how we create change
 Anyway, so there's your exercise for all of you guys go sit down figure out your value galaxy
 Building the value themes and look at the the values that you want your kids to have or you want your employees to have
 Then maybe they don't have right now and then not force them into but how do you inspire them to?
 To create that as a value that'll be exciting and change their life as well. So there you go. Hope that helps
 Hope it gets you excited got me excited. I'm still like just freaking out because I'm so excited by it
