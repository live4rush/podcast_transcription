 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and this is a post birthday launch report here on the marketing seekers podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question and this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing seekers
 Hey everybody, I hope you guys are all doing awesome. I am actually sitting in the Jeep right now about to start it
 But I'm really tired. So I thought I would jump on here real quick and just give you guys an update and what's been happening
 It's been crazy. I can't tell you guys on the last
 episode about
 just some of the stuff
 building the buzz for the birthday launch and all the things we were doing and
 I'll kind of give you an update of what happened there and then what happened today and
 I'm not gonna lie. It's a little crazy. So hope you guys are up for a fun story. So as you know, we're in Fiji
 I was in Fiji. I made the video kind of talking about
 The rumors was happening we posted it and it went insane insanely viral more than anything
 I think I've ever personally done before in the past and
 I had people everybody messaging me my friends people on her from 10 years my dad like
 Like I can tell you young people are messaging me about what's happening like are you selling or you know
 just like
 You're trying to start rumors and it man. It worked like I've never seen before so that that was really fun and
 We had people registering for a for Facebook
 Facebook live and I don't think I don't know if you can see how people register or not but tons of people registering and
 Anyway, we that you know step number one was completely like the buzz my hype was happening
 last night was Sunday and I
 Don't like I knew the birthday launches coming up
 We had all the other things happening like Thursday and Friday
 I took off to read the the traffic secrets book live so I could find the edits I needed to make so I was locked down
 You know I got one for Fiji on Tuesday
 Wednesday I was trying to get the book edits done and then Thursday Friday about the book live
 So like this week's just been crazy since then Saturday
 I went with the kids and kind of detached and just kind of played the kids all weekend long and Sunday night about night
 I was like I have to do slides for tomorrow. Like I don't even say but I got on how I'm gonna say it
 So I started slides at night. I got done like a 130
 Last night and then I had to go to bed cuz I'd lift it six and I long enough like 530
 So went to bed got a four hours or five hours of sleep. That's four hours. Oh dang
 I'm hurtin so bad right now a four hours of sleep woke up worked out
 Race to the office and we're like okay. It's go time went through everything we do left
 And then I jumped in and she'll work on slides again Leon. Who's amazing designer. He's in Miami
 He's in Google slides with me. So he's editing design slides and making a crazy
 Jake and Nick are working on the software the new funnel flakes
 Which I'll tell you what that is here a little bit and it's you know going through that and go through the pages and just you know
 the whole marketing team there's just a million things happening and there's a big party happening in Georgia and
 You know a big click both birthday party there and birthday cake and everyone celebrating working hard and training's done and
 You know everyone on this side here boys and trying to get everything done
 Make sure it's working and it's 30 minutes before I'm working on slides fast
 I can also see a comment in the
 In our slack shadow from one of the developers working on funnel flakes
 He said something and it's kind of confusing like if something's not working whatever
 So I was kind of joking to like hey, well should we postpone the launch and he wrote back? Yeah, you probably should cuz it's not working right now
 And I was like no what like excuse me like I'm gonna live in fifth or excuse me in less than 30 minutes like
 I mean this has to go out. We can't we can't stop this like this has to happen and
 I run out I'm asking where else it was happening. They're all time figured out and
 You're fixed 30 minutes for trying to get things figured out and I'm running in trying to make sure the cameras
 Is set up in the the lights and that you know the coronation for how we can do this Facebook live and all the craziness and
 bring it back and forth and back and forth and finally its four minutes for sister to go live and I go in there and they're like
 It's not gonna work
 So they're like just do your announcement tell them to you know come check tomorrow and I'm like there's no way
 It that I am going to
 to tell people to not buy when I'm on this Facebook live like we're here like we're gonna buy and and
 Like just keep working on it
 And I'm gonna figure out some way to spin it and we'll go and that's the last thing I said
 I ran in and I'm like two minutes past time and I'm like stressing out
 I told everyone to get the whole audience the whole like a bunch of my teens in there
 I'm like just you guys know the reason why I'm looking really super stressed is literally funnel flakes just crashed and it's not working and
 and
 I've no idea what to do and we're going live. All right ready go
 And so we start the thing and I'm sure I look so nervous and freaked out because I was and like all stress is happening and
 And then what's so let me say something good stuff happened. So it was crazy is 5,000 people were live on it Facebook not like
 You know like oh during you know at the end of your Facebook live was sure it's like oh during the last you know
 Time some people have like seen this there's like no 5,000 were on live live like the number like 5,000 5k was like live
 YouTube had 2,000 live
 Instagram live had 400
 456
 We were on Twitter per scope again couple of ones in between all platforms
 I think we're close to 8,000 people's live which is crazy
 I we had more when we did the Tony Robbins thing, but I wasn't my my deal. They wanted to come see Tony
 This was like for our deal like it's almost 8,000 people's live and
 And which is insane. So it was crazy and doing the thing
 We have some troubles of first because like normally when I speak if I'm doing a webinar
 Like it's all slides if I'm on stage is me talking and there's slides happening in the background
 But here's like this thing was like I was talking to Cameron their slides and kind of going back and forth and trying to time with the video guys
 You were doing the slides was kind of like we got thrown off a little bit
 It was just I wish I could tell you how much stress was happening
 It was kind of crazy and then I was on top of that and this extra layer of stress was like my announcement
 So I'm supposed to be announcing and like we're changing click phones
 We're getting rid of some features people love we're adding some things that people are gonna love but
 You know and I got to sell it because I got it because they've got an upgrade to get access to it and like I
 Can't tell you the amount of stress and pressure and
 All the things I was feeling and fear and I was just like seriously
 We launched stuff all the time like how was it every time we do launch like it feels like the internet falls apart like seconds before
 So anyway, and then I guess halfway through the Facebook live something happened the Facebook
 I've crashed since we lost 5,000 people made a new one and then we got a bunch of people back
 We lost some and oh
 Chaos so much chaos anyway
 But I go up there and I start doing my thing I go through my slides with my presentation. I'm doing my best
 I have no idea if it's going well. I'm just going horrible because I can't see anybody's
 This is going well and
 Anyway, I do the whole thing and I end and it closes down and people go crazy and
 Oh, I'm not sure I'm gonna tell you next all kind of go through what I talked about Facebook live here in a minute
 But I did a price marinating I guess in the middle of the people flipping out
 All upset and then I came back and I dropped the price and they're all like cheering on the comments and
 It was all sorts of craziness
 So besides oh and then sorry right before I got the point I'm pitching funnel flicks
 I'm going through the funnel flicks thing also Dave burst through the back doors like waving his hands
 I'm like what he's like it's live like oh, it's live like
 Like they've been fixed you know for the last hour while I'm talking about to try to get things working and fixing
 They finally got to work which was like a miracle in and of a in and of a self and
 Anyway, it was it was chaos. It was crazy and now it's done and in a little bit now
 They're editing the video. They're gonna post the replays everywhere. So there should be a replay coming out here
 And a little bit for everybody to go and watch as well
 But it turned out it turned out pretty great
 despite the chaos and the stress and the pressure and the fear and the
 Just just all the things so I'm in the car now about to head home
 But I'm all kind of give you recap on updates case you haven't had chance to see but how do I come in going and seeing it?
 Go watch me in my nervousness and my
 Anxiety and go see what it all looks like but basically it's kind of a twofold thing number one is we are doubling down our focus on being the category
 King of sales funnels, which means we're cutting some features. We're getting rid of some stuff
 And so that was kind of the first half of the presentation
 I talked about why and I try to make it a teaching moment as well so people can understand the concept of category kings and hopefully
 Get the wheels and people's own minds spinning about their own their own businesses
 So that was the first half and second half as we were launching this new thing because
 Filters reason why people don't have success with click funnels is like they don't understand the strategy
 That's it
 So it's like I want to make I want to make this more accessible to people like how to make this easier as people don't have to go buy
 Access tonight 20 different courses to learn all the stuff like how do we put it all underneath one roof?
 And so we launched this new thing called funnel flicks and funnel flicks
 Basically gives you it's we licensed or we brought in like all my my courses in the past
 But licensing courses people like Tony Robbins and Garrett white and putting them all into this thing
 It looks like Netflix, but for funnels and funnel related content media and things like that
 And so it's literally like I don't 50 or 60 thousand dollars with the courses all inside one
 Members are it looks like Netflix. Oh, it's so cool
 And so you can go in now and geek out and so we did is basically launched this new level of click phones called click phones platinum
 And eventually be six hundred ninety seven dollars a month right now. It's for those who can start right now
 It's two hundred ninety seven dollars a month to upgrade to it
 So you get platinum level. It gives you access to all the platinum features a click funnels plus it gives you
 access to funnel flicks
 And you get all the courses in there for free, which is pretty exciting. So actually almost all of them
 We have another announcement happening on a funnel hacking live and what happening on my 40th birthday
 We'll launch the next things and talk about the next pieces of it, but that was kind of phase number one's phase number one's all about
 Focusing on the core click funnels
 Software cutting out all the the extra stuff and then I said it way more eloquently in the in the way in the
 Presentation so you should definitely go watch it and then step two
 was all about funnel flicks and
 And so anyway, it turned out really good
 So if you want to go see it if you go to Facebook or YouTube and search click funnels five your birthday launch
 I'm sure to pull up
 If you just want to go check it out go to funnel flicks calm and you can see what the new funnel flicks is this amazing
 You see trailers for all different courses that are in there right now
 And or you can go to upgrade now.com is where if you read upgrades go upgrade now to comedy and get access to all the stuff
 So that's kind of what it was and it's been crazy and hectic and you know
 I'm sure still a lot of bugs and stuff will be fixing tonight and tomorrow and over next week and two weeks
 But it is out we gave birth to it
 It's out there in the world people know about it people are sunny up people are watching stuff
 I've saw his people message like I'm watching Garrett wise question
 I'm watching Tony Robbins and everyone's like learning and studying and I think it's gonna be really cool for families
 They can log in and watch stuff as entrepreneurs and like learn from each other and
 Anyway, hopefully we're doing the right moves are trying to make things better and better for our
 funnel hackers for our clickfuddles members and so I figure by doubling down focus on on the clickfuddles software and
 Opening up all the training and make it more simple. It'll hopefully do that for everybody
 So I'm excited. We're really passionate about this and just excited to hopefully help change your guys lives even more
 Also, if you're looking for a way to make some extra money on the side by answering clickfuddles tickets
 I talked about that in the webinars well in a way where paying people a little with three bucks to answer ticket and
 You guys can make money while you're building funnels help pay for your clickfuddles accounts and other stuff
 I actually going in there and serving other funnel hackers helping about so anyway, it was fun
 I recommend going listen to it
 Because you'll learn some stuff and you'll see me awkwardly nervously fumbling through things usually I'm confident my presentations
 I definitely was was nervous and anxious and in fact the software wasn't working when I'm standing up there pitching it and and
 All the other things it was it was a lot, but it's done and it's it's out there. So hopefully it gives any of you guys faith
 For you know when you're doing stuff and you're nervous and you're anxious and things are working and things are breaking around you and
 The world seems to be falling apart that you can you can still go and just do it and just you know run with the punches
 Have fun with it and and you know today could have totally flopped
 Luckily didn't though people are upgrading and
 Having success and it's it was fun
 So hopefully it gives them inspiration know that even over here that I'm stressed out and fumbling behind the scenes things break and things fall apart
 But you know and all said done it it as long as you just keep moving forward
 I mean there's so many different points we could have quit and canceled
 You know like I could cancel off sound like my slides are done's canceled
 It's like nope
 I gotta get done this could have been like all this cancel because the software broke right?
 Nope, we're just gonna keep pushing forward like oh we should cancel because you know the Facebook live drop the middle
 Like no, which is keep moving forward
 They just keep just keep running for as fast as you can
 It just you know all the obstacles and trials and things will hit and it's just keep moving forward because now it's launched
 Now it's like okay, we take the video replays and restream it and now we can go and fix the software
 I mean going like add the descriptions to all the course lessons like there's so many things we we still need to do
 But unless you launch you can't do any of it
 So it's just like just get it out best you can and go back and iterate on it
 So so we do with click funnels that we do the funnel flicks and we'll probably do the future as well
 But we're trying our best and trying to serve you guys the best that we can so there you go
 I appreciate you all go check out funnel flicks
