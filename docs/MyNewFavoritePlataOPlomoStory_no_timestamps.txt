 What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson I want to welcome you to the marketing secrets podcast
 So the big question is this
 How are entrepreneurs like us who didn't cheat and take on venture capital for spending money from our own pockets?
 How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world?
 And yet still remain profitable
 That is the question in this podcast will give you the answers
 My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to marketing secrets
 Hey everyone, so it's Friday it's last day of school. I just watched my fifth grader graduate fifth grade
 Which is exciting and tonight we are driving to Utah
 For a couple reasons number one
 Let's see my mom and dad, which is always amazing number two
 my kids go see my brother and his kids, which is really exciting and
 They're pumped for that and number three is as we're gonna be filled going to Tim Ballard's
 And we'll be filming apart for the OER documentary kind of a call to action at the end where people can help donate to raise money for
 Operation again railroad and then number four
 There's a big thing entrepreneur of the year award thing number two that I'm in the finals for and I'm going down for that
 Apparently it's a black tie event, which I don't have black tie stuff so yesterday. I raced to
 Men's warehouse and bought a nice suit and then vice tie and other getting more custom fitted
 I'm hoping and praying they get him done before I drive past
 the building on the way out of town because
 Otherwise, I will be dressed up in flip flops and shorts at my black tie event
 Anyway, wish me luck. Hopefully I'll have a shot winning the entrepreneur the universe kind of fun
 And that's gonna happen and we this week we had our two comic club X event
 was here in Boise and it was really cool we had about
 253 and people who were here and then
 And then they are and I didn't go to the event. I'm trying to for those those system events. It's like run by by James
 P frill and then Stephen Larson Julie story and John parks and then Brent Co Peter's kind of running
 It's like I don't need to be that those ones are so nice
 They've been doing them all so I can stay home continue working on mother funnel, which is still not live
 anyway, I digress and
 Anyway, but afterwards they wanted to come to tour the office
 So they're all but busting over to come to a tour the office and I was like I want to speak and like no
 You go home. It's gonna be too much and they're all going like pictures with you
 I'm like I know but I really want to talk these guys
 And so we jammed like 200 people into our conference room
 They'll like 60 people who were sitting on the floors and standing your room only and I came in and had a chance to your presentation
 For them, which was really really fun
 Love that stuff the energy of the room was just
 Like palatable you can feel you can taste it. It was so cool
 Anyway, and I shared them some some stuff
 The one thing I want to talk to you as about is those who are in the two comic club X program
 You remember that I give a presentation from a hockey live called plot toe or plow mo which
 stands for letter gold or the silver or the bullet and how direct of translation you want to get and
 And the whole thing was like basically like you we want you guys to meet a two-coma
 Club, but if you want to come in that you have to set your letter gold bike thing and the the store ban letter goal
 I heard this originally from Gary Halbert
 I talked about how like the Mexican Mafia or whatever if they want to get a lot past or a lot changed it go to the to the
 You know politicians like you need to change law and they're like no, that's insane
 So I said that night then these these same mobsters and
 They'd break into the homes of the politicians and they would come up to them when they'd have a gun in one hand
 And they'd have a bag of gold in the other hand or silver and say you you need to make the law change
 And you've got one you got two options number one is lead
 I'm gonna kill you if you don't number two is gold or you know silver you get paid if you do and
 And that was kind of the metaphor and so you know when that's your two options
 You the letter gold you pretty much figure out a way to make it happen, right?
 But those are your only options and so the whole thing with this is like look
 He doesn't want me to comic club like you can't stop you got to stop thinking about it and dreaming about it
 and you need to make it a thing like make it a letter gold plot to our plomo thing and
 And so this is why we have this coaching program
 We call it two comma club accidents to get to comic club award and then to come up with X
 Which is a figure award and and it's gonna be plot for a plo and we're gonna like push you guys along
 It needs to be it needs to be life or death like if you if you can trick your mind into being that you actually have success
 And and from that you know they had three thousand so people in the room
 600 or so signed up for the program and thought the people later in this program that we've been serving and
 It's just been really really fun and we're sending them all these cool plot for plomo things
 They all got t-shirts and they plot for plomo down. It's like it's it's like the the chant the mission statement for them
 It's like look letter gold. We gotta make this happen. We're moving it for it
 We're doing it and it's not it's not a cheap program
 It's either eighteen thousand dollars a year or eighteen hundred bucks a month
 So it's expensive and it's I told my reason why it's expensive is I want this pushing you and like and like getting you to
 Take steps because if it's like oh, it's a ninety seven dollar month conduit program
 You you're not gonna take this serious is like oh my gosh like I gotta make this I gotta make this work and
 Anyway, so I did this little presentation and I talked about a bunch of things
 But I was a big one is just like look you guys like you know
 For like you I was two months ago
 Where are you at now like if you've been setting your own deadlines?
 I said a deadline make it a plot to our plomo deadline
 I have to get this piece of the puzzle done and like don't go to bed till it's done and then pick the next day and like
 Set these dates and pull you through and
 Anyway, so it was it was it was really cool
 And then the coolest part is this morning
 So one of my friends and if you've been listening podcast for every heard I did I did a podcast one of my friends in
 elementary and junior high school who was struggling and
 And I reached out to my Facebook and anyway, I tell a story and different podcast and I can go deep into it
 But I basically told I said hey if you if you go and
 And listen to my podcast, I'll tell you what you know
 What it is I think you need to do to to help you and and he agreed to do that
 He went listen to like 20 or 30 podcasts already courted an hour long podcasts for him specifically
 So if you go back in the archives, you can find it's an hour long I talk about
 Three types of people in the business. There's the anyway good go and find it
 But there's your there's my trick to you go binge listen to every episode of the last year
 But it's not a year ago. So hopefully you can go and find it anyway long story short
 from acting live
 Still communicating with this friend and he wasn't able to come because you know it's expensive
 He wasn't making enough money yet
 And I said look this is all give you free ticket if you can figure out where to get out there and
 It was fun as this morning. He I don't want to ruin the story
 But he joined the two common clovex program
 He was he came this morning my house and we came out for like an hour and kind of talk
 And he was telling me the sort of his point of view
 He's like look I didn't have money to come to the event
 And so I put on credit cards and I was like you know
 Hopefully I can figure out a way to make at least the three gram back and credit cards
 So they came out there these I can then you guys made the the presentation for the two common clovex the plot to her plomo
 And he's like he's like and I was like sick to my stomach
 I have so much fun to watch you do the presentation and see the master doing his thing
 He's like but then that I went back to my hotel room and and I was sick to my stomachs
 I knew I needed to be in it, but I didn't have the money
 He's like you don't understand he's like my my rent is like 700 bucks a month
 He's like the last two years prior is making $25,000 a year. He's like what we are in poverty
 And he made this presentation it was $1,800 a month
 He said I sat in my room crying because I knew I needed to be part of it
 But I knew I couldn't I called my wife and you know we talked about it
 You know we're not in a point in our life we can and maybe in the future we will figure out a way to do it
 And stay went to bed that night and he's struggling couldn't sleep very well
 It's the next morning woke up and he went down to the event early and was standing around and I went he was talking to Kevin
 Aniston who's one of our video dudes a guy does all the fun on hot TV stuff and
 He's after talking to Kevin
 He's like I need to join he said I walked over to the thing and I gave my credit card. I signed up
 For this program is 1800 bucks a month that I I couldn't afford but I knew I need to do so soon
 I felt he's like I had chills. I felt like he's like I just I knew it was the right decision
 And I had no such time had I know and I'd be like no dude like I probably would have liked talked him out of it
 They said he said he's so scared he didn't tell his wife right away
 So he went home for our week before he told his wife and they finally told her and she was like we don't
 Have 1800 bucks a month of I can't do is like I know but now I have my plot for a plumber
 like I have to figure this out I got to do it and he started just telling me what he did afterwards and and
 He went and he created an offer like I saw her also created offers
 I created an offer from my video work and they went and I presented somebody and and he said they were excited
 But they couldn't afford it so they said no and I was kind of bummed out and he said I met someone else when we're
 going to project and then I
 They wanted to do more stuff with me
 So they asked me for quote and I told him twenty five thousand dollars
 I made him an offer I kind of did a stack like you did and you think they said yes
 You think that one deal I'm more than paid for the coaching program and then and then since they closed another deal
 11,000 I believe he said and he's got the ones coming in the pipeline and
 For him it was that that plot to our plomo where it was like you know for a year prior
 We've been talking about this you listen the podcast even that kind of moving things forward
 But it wasn't until he had that like that letter gold thing where it's like look you've got two options
 Either either make this work or you're done and when he had to he was able to figure out a way
 And so I just want to shout to you because man
 He was telling that story this morning at someone who's a friend who I've known since I was five years old
 It was cool, and I I
 Would be kidding you if I didn't tell you I was scared to death when I found out he had signed up
 I was like dude, I know you don't have the money for this like you shouldn't be buying this
 But for him
 It was like I needed that that letter goal to push me to make sure that I that I did it
 It's like now I've got this network of humans that an entrepreneurs who I I connect with a different level than normal people and like all these
 all these amazing things are coming from it and and
 Anyway, so plot to work long
 I just want to share with you guys because and a lot of you guys have been playing this game for a long time even listening you've
 Sit on the sidelines paying attention enjoying it
 But I think for a lot of you as you're not gonna have the success you want until
 You make that plot to our plomo decision
 It doesn't have to mean giving me eighteen hundred bucks a month like that's cool if you want to do that totally out for it
 But it means like like setting your deadlines like this is has to happen and enforcing your mind to believe it
 I'm in a weird state now where
 Click funnels is growing insanely fast and
 You know all these and like this amazing stuff's happening and like I don't need more money
 We don't need to like launch next funnel whatever, but I still trick my mind like hey
 This is the launch it has to happen plot to our plomo and like and I get my whole team commit
 So we set these dates and we don't miss them like that's why you probably hear me on the podcast sometimes like well
 It's three in the morning, but we had to be here because tomorrow the funnels going live
 You probably think why in the world is Russell doing that like it's like he's made enough money
 He doesn't need to launch this next funnel. I just push it out a week or two and get it done the right way and the reason is because
 Because I know what causes success. It's that mindset of plot to our plomo's
 I'm I said like this has to happen like I
 Would argue the reason why I've been successful is because of that because I've trick my mind in that I continue to
 The reason why I continue to keep pushing the envelope is more continuing to grow like I've been in this game for 15 years
 Now I've seen friends and businesses come and go business who I thought were so big
 They would never topple they're gone now you guys wouldn't even recognize the names if I mentioned them and
 And what's the difference? I think the other one people come and place it
 I feel like I don't want to be complacent. I want to continue to grow and to serve
 Like I can't have the impact on the world
 I want to have if I stop or if I shrink like I got to keep on growing and so it's like setting these deadlines keeping things moving
 Going forward like plot to our plomo for me
 Doesn't just mean money means the impact I want to have and so I just encourage you guys to start looking at that mindset and shifting it
 And realizing like someone broke into your house tonight and said look this phone's got to go live by Friday
 Or else you're dead or if he does live you get this gold like which one are you gonna do?
 What would you do and how would you trick your mind to be able to figure out the right way to do it?
 And if you do that you're gonna figure out the right answer so there you go
 Hope that helps you guys I'm gonna go in get some stuff done because we got a webinar next week in my plot to
 Plomo moment. I literally have two hours and 15 minutes for us to be done because that point I'm jumping in car and driving to Utah
 So plot to our plomo
 That's what's happening right now in my world pick your date make a plot to our plomo moment and and run after it
